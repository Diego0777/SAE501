1
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:39,678
"Know thyself." That's what Socrates said.

2
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:42,943
<i>Or Aristotle or one of them dead white men.</i>

3
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,540
To know yourself.

4
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,721
That's the hardest thing
anyone of us can ever do.

5
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:53,949
...except that I felt very guilty.
So that was very much a Catholic thing.

6
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,358
- Keller.
- Yo.

7
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:32,158
I got you scheduled for a 10:00 a.m. Session
with Sister Peter Marie.

8
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,199
- Yeah.
- It's almost 10:00 now.

9
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,696
You know something, I don't wanna go.

10
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,500
I want to check in some gym time.

11
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:41,541
Suit yourself. Take him.

12
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:08,662
Keller gone?

13
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,496
Never came.
Second appointment he's missed.

14
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:15,766
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,138
Seems okay. We don't really talk much.

16
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,643
When you do talk...

17
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,647
has he ever said anything
about our sessions?

18
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,112
Nope.

19
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,813
Sister Pete, are you all right?

20
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,016
Yeah.

21
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,462
- You're lying.
- I swear the truth.

22
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,193
What's going on with you
and Sister Peter Marie?

23
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,498
Going on?

24
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,404
You missed two appointments
and she's a mess.

25
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,274
I don't know what you're talking about.

26
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:55,003
If you're gonna fuck with her, Keller,
I'm gonna fuck with you.

27
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,671
Fucking bitch.

28
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,684
What was that about?

29
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,883
It's his time of the month.

30
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,724
All right, let's go.

31
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,505
Miguel's on his way.

32
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,921
Hello, Miguel. Thank you, officer.

33
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,561
Eugene and Tina Rivera. Miguel Alvarez.

34
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,760
All right, everybody.

35
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:50,827
Our purpose here today
is to provide an environment for discussion.

36
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,465
Sit down, Miguel.

37
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,498
To ask and answer questions...

38
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,976
to share experiences.

39
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,147
A few ground rules.

40
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:08,248
Allow me to lead the meeting.

41
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,348
Refrain from interruptions.

42
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,222
Tell the truth.

43
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:15,527
No profanity.

44
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:18,063
And most importantly, listen.

45
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,727
Why don't you begin, Eugene?

46
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,595
I can't see you, Alvarez.

47
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:30,409
I'm looking right at you and I can't see you.

48
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,643
Can you see me?

49
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,839
What?

50
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,005
Yeah.

51
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:40,018
Can you see my wife?

52
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:42,410
Yes.

53
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,284
You're a lucky man.

54
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:48,754
I asked Tina to marry me
'cause I wanted to wake up every day...

55
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:52,195
for the rest of my life,
and see her face first thing.

56
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,556
But instead...

57
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:58,167
'cause of you, I'll never see her face again.

58
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,074
Do you know something about me
which I don't?

59
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:04,299
A reason I deserved this?

60
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,203
No.

61
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:14,150
Have you thought about
what this might be like for him?

62
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,415
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

63
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,124
So why go after me?

64
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:26,890
Not Metzger, not Wittlesey, not Glynn...

65
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,392
or McManus or Sister Pete.

66
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,668
Me, Alvarez. Why?

67
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,007
- Answer him, God damn it!
- Tina.

68
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:38,602
No. He's asking why.
Why do we have to live with this?

69
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,873
Why do we have to argue
about having a kid?

70
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,381
We shouldn't have to argue about
having a fucking kid.

71
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,179
Please, sit down.

72
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,878
Yeah, honey, sit.

73
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,956
You see, Miguel,
that's why Eugene and Tina are here.

74
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,787
Tell them why it happened.

75
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:00,160
I can't.

76
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,559
Was it a gang thing?

77
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,570
Did you do it 'cause of Hernandez?

78
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:09,230
You earned your <i>cojones</i> by blinding me?

79
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:13,674
It started out that way, yeah.

80
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:18,309
But, you know, this place...

81
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,677
I hate this fucking place.

82
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,520
What it did to my grandpa, my dad, and me.

83
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,224
I don't know you, you know.

84
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,054
I had nothing against you.

85
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,057
It was your uniform, bro.

86
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,997
It was a <i>hermano</i> in that uniform, man.

87
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,137
I want my eyes back.

88
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,303
I know.

89
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,182
- Sorry.
- You're what?

90
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:51,841
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,082
No! I said I want my eyes back.
Give them back to me.

92
00:07:57,056 --> 00:08:00,219
- I can't.
- Why not? You took them.

93
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:04,460
- Forgive me.
- Fuck you.

94
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,663
Miguel asked you a question.

95
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,838
Can you forgive him?

96
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,848
- Not today.
- All right.

97
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,519
Let's leave the door open
for the possibility of another meeting, okay?

98
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:36,493
Maybe.

99
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,873
<i>Clark Kent is the secret identity</i>
<i>of Superman.</i>

100
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:57,007
I never understood why Superman
needed a secret identity.

101
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:01,820
Listen, if I'm invulnerable,
if all the chicks want me...

102
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,649
why would I disguise myself
as a four-eyed wimp?

103
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,388
<i>The truth: Superman is schizophrenic.</i>

104
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,894
Superman's id is fucking with his superego.

105
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,095
<i>The man's conflicted, no doubt about it.</i>

106
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:34,318
- Hello, Chris.
- Hiya, Sister.

107
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:38,517
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Let's go in here.

108
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,895
Sorry about this.

109
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,498
You missed our last two sessions. Why?

110
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:58,711
Ever since our last time together
when you got me to open up...

111
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,008
I've been afraid to come back.

112
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,913
Afraid to expose any more of myself to you.

113
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,086
The reality is, Sister, I hate myself.

114
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:11,419
All the more reason
why you should have come to me.

115
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,422
You're probably right.

116
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,833
Do you know what it's like
to want somebody?

117
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,138
To long for them?
And I'm not talking about sex.

118
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,871
Just to touch them.

119
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,304
Yeah.

120
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:36,746
Of course you do.

121
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,209
You're a psychologist, you're a nun.

122
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,151
But you're a woman first.

123
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:46,887
You know about desires.

124
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,996
- Everything all right in there, Sister?
- I'm fine.

125
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,334
- I can help you, Chris.
- I know you can. Talk to Beecher.

126
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,836
Counsel him. Convince him.

127
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,573
Tell him that you love him?
And that he loves you?

128
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,611
And that's what this has all been about,
hasn't it?

129
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:14,744
The sessions,
the questions about my personal life...

130
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,187
getting me to care.

131
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,322
So I can help you reach Beecher.

132
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:24,089
You can do it. He trusts you.

133
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:27,155
You still don't see it, do you?

134
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,530
That's the whole problem.

135
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:35,037
He trusted you. You broke his trust.
Now he can't trust you again.

136
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,837
Yeah, but I've changed.

137
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,709
Have you?

138
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:42,439
You've manipulated me
the way you did him...

139
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:49,485
and I don't trust you anymore.

140
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,889
Wait a minute.

141
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:56,560
Let go of me.

142
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,695
Hell hath no fury, Sister?

143
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,579
<i>Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

144
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,015
<i>I had lust in my heart.</i>

145
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:31,162
<i>You haven't acted on this lust?</i>

146
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:32,956
No.

147
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,025
- But...
- You may.

148
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,431
No.

149
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:42,905
Then?

150
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:50,244
It's opened up all these feelings in me.

151
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:55,381
Feelings that I thought
I had paved over years ago.

152
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:02,790
Now that I'm back in touch
with these feelings...

153
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:09,696
it seems wrong to shut them off again.

154
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,442
I owe it to my soul...

155
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:21,112
to be all of the things that I am...

156
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:25,175
all of the parts of myself.

157
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,423
And so?

158
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,598
I've decided to leave the convent.

159
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:46,967
To stop being a nun.

160
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,019
Come on, help yourself out.

161
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,992
We found the heroin on you, in your pocket.

162
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,357
Where'd you get it?

163
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,462
Don't fuck with me, Hernandez.

164
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,402
I can tack on another five
just for obstruction...

165
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,736
and think what I can do
with the possession charge.

166
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:27,036
I got two more of your <i>compadres</i>
to talk to...

167
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:31,174
and I'm willing to bet at least one of them
values his ass over yours.

168
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,445
Get him the fuck out of here.

169
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,463
- Carlo, wanna help me out?
- Help? How?

170
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,862
I know you think you're a badass
like Hernandez and Guerra...

171
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:55,704
but I've been watching you. You're not.
Your family visits regularly.

172
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,741
You come from a better place
than those two other fucks.

173
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:03,908
I can make life a lot easier for you.
Where is Hernandez getting the drugs?

174
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,746
Take him back to the hole.

175
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:16,357
Till you talk,
you will not see an inch of daylight.

176
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:21,196
If I find out what I need to know
from anybody else, you'll never see it again.

177
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:34,010
I'm here to see my brother, Carlo Ricardo.

178
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:39,207
No, sorry.

179
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:43,352
- It is visiting day, isn't it?
- Yes, but your brother's in ad seg.

180
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,322
- What's that?
- He's been segregated from the others.

181
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:49,452
He's had his privileges taken away,
including visitation rights.

182
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:52,292
- But I have to see him.
- Sure. Not today.

183
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,358
- You don't understand.
- Lf I had a nickel...

184
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:58,801
for every time I didn't understand,
you'd be talking to an empty chair.

185
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:03,507
- Where's your superior?
- Miss, I'm really trying to be pleasant.

186
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:06,773
I'm not leaving
until I talk to someone in charge.

187
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,547
In Oz, we don't really take
too well to demands.

188
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,611
I have to see my brother.

189
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:20,681
He got caught dealing drugs
and he refuses to talk...

190
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:25,293
so we don't have any choice
but to keep him in the hole.

191
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:28,492
- Could I see him in there?
- No, you'll come back when he gets out.

192
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,627
You don't understand. I am all he's got.

193
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:35,234
Luis is disappearing, days at a time.

194
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:38,300
Isabella, fucking baby crying.
Juan is an asshole.

195
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,902
<i>Mami</i> goes between the apartment, work,
and the hospital.

196
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,448
- I'm sorry, but...
- I got a job in Oakland.

197
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:46,212
It's good money.
I have to take it to support my family.

198
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,946
I leave tomorrow.

199
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,047
I can't get there and right away say I gotta
go home to see my brother in prison.

200
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:54,592
They don't even know
I have a brother in prison.

201
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:59,097
I don't want him to think that
I've abandoned him, that he's dead to me.

202
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:03,334
Just for one minute, to tell him.
Just one minute, I promise.

203
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,064
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:11,668
I can't. There's just no way.

205
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,670
But you can write him a note...

206
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:19,449
and I'll see that he gets it.

207
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,350
This'll kill him.

208
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:29,852
Lopresti, I gotta split.

209
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,023
Do me a favor
and take this to Carlo Ricardo in the hole.

210
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:35,397
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.

211
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,532
Since when do you take messages
to that fucking spic?

212
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,601
Yeah, fuck that.

213
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,719
You ain't so bad now?

214
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:02,893
- Hello, Roger.
- Lenore.

215
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:06,398
- Long time, huh?
- Look at you. You look great.

216
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:10,492
Thank you. I'm just dropping Clayton off
and I wanted to say hi to Leo.

217
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:14,130
- He was supposed to meet us down here.
- My car is still in the shop.

218
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,106
Clayton's embarrassed.

219
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,200
- I am not, Mom.
- It's all right.

220
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:21,412
It's good to see you
and it's good to have Clayton with us.

221
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,947
Oh, my.

222
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,988
It's so strange being back in here.

223
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:31,249
Yeah, I can imagine.

224
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:35,054
I told your wife this morning that
I didn't think I could come in this door...

225
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,527
but Clayton's never been happier.

226
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,598
- He loves his job.
- Mom.

227
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:44,230
I have something for you.
Found it in the attic.

228
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,164
You and Sammy were so young.

229
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,971
Yeah, we were.

230
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,672
Thanks, Lenore.

231
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,807
Keep him there, close to your heart.

232
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,652
And this one, too, keep him safe.

233
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:07,457
- Of course. Don't you worry.
- Bye.

234
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,663
- Happy birthday, Clayton.
- Happy birthday?

235
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,369
- I got it.
- I can't find them.

236
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,702
- It's the drawer on the right.
- Right.

237
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:23,564
No.

238
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,906
We can't have a birthday cake
without candles.

239
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:29,470
- I'll go into town and buy some.
- No, Hughes' shift starts in 10 minutes.

240
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,914
I got everybody meeting
at the library at 12:00.

241
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:35,579
This is a really great idea, Diane,
throwing Clayton a surprise party.

242
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,485
Yeah, my heart goes out to the kid.

243
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:40,150
One, because I know what it's like
starting work here...

244
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:43,559
everybody thinking you don't have the balls
for the job. Two, his dad.

245
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,290
I've been checking into that...

246
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,628
the circumstances
surrounding his dad's death.

247
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,464
- Did you find anything out?
- I talked to William Giles...

248
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,801
who was in the cafeteria
when Hughes got stabbed...

249
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:58,001
and he claims...
I don't know whether to believe him or not.

250
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,307
If I do believe him, I don't know what to do.

251
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:03,177
If I do something about it,
who knows what'll happen.

252
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:04,580
You're raving.

253
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,552
He says that Sam Hughes was stabbed
by Leo.

254
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,483
Leo who? DiCaprio?

255
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:14,884
- Glynn.
- Leo Glynn?

256
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
- Yes.
- Giles is delusional.

257
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:20,531
I know. I dismiss it and then I think...

258
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,502
maybe that's why the murderer
was never identified.

259
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,537
Something tells me
that Leo has never told the whole truth.

260
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:35,237
What about a votive candle?

261
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:38,007
- What?
- For the cake.

262
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,313
Can't we steal those candles
you use at Mass?

263
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:43,947
Yeah, I guess. I'll get some.
I'll meet you in the library.

264
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,885
If you seriously doubt Leo,
you owe it to the man to tell him.

265
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,204
Leo, you got a minute?

266
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,638
- Sure. Walk me to my office.
- Okay.

267
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,405
Like I told you,
I'm talking to people about Sam Hughes.

268
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,207
Yes, what did you get?
Did you come up with something?

269
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,909
- Maybe. William Giles.
- That loony tunes?

270
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:15,475
I don't think that he's so much crazy
as just afraid to be sane.

271
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:19,046
- And he claims... Well, he says...
- What?

272
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,050
...that you killed Sam Hughes.

273
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,924
Leo, you have talked to Clayton
about what happened.

274
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,125
You have told him the truth.

275
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,931
But if there's more to that truth,
then he has a right to hear it...

276
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,735
however hard it is for you to say.

277
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:39,369
God damn it, Ray.
I don't have to explain myself to you.

278
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:40,969
No, you don't.

279
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:43,305
But you do to Clayton.

280
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,012
It's like a confession.

281
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,386
It needs to be made once...

282
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,618
and only to the person
who can absolve you.

283
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,687
Get the fuck out of my office.

284
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,825
- It's time to open up.
- Go ahead, we're almost done.

285
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,465
- Thanks for this, Diane.
- Sure.

286
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,699
Promise me when my birthday comes,
we don't celebrate it.

287
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,300
- Hey, O'Reily!
- "Hey" what?

288
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,278
Your brother fight like a girl, man.

289
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,712
Yeah? You wanna go
a couple rounds with him, homey?

290
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:19,683
- I'll take you and your brother.
- You and what fucking army?

291
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:20,776
Knock it off!

292
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:23,651
- Don't talk to me. Talk to the brother here.
- Sit down.

293
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,815
- I didn't come to sit down.
- Sit the fuck down.

294
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,620
What are you gonna do, spank me?

295
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,389
- You got a problem?
- Get your fucking hands...

296
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:31,821
Fuck!

297
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:34,321
It's okay.

298
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:40,293
Don't.

299
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:48,279
- She gonna be okay?
- A few stitches, mild concussion.

300
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:52,741
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- I was trying to maintain order.

301
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,981
The way I hear it,
there wasn't much to maintain.

302
00:22:56,989 --> 00:23:00,152
- I've warned you before.
- So, what, are you gonna fire me?

303
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:01,982
Sit down.

304
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,635
I wanna tell you
about the day your father died.

305
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:23,608
<i>Your dad and I were both on duty.</i>

306
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,018
<i>I made up my mind,</i>
<i>when I first walked into Oz...</i>

307
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,715
<i>that I was going to treat each situation</i>
<i>as a worst-case scenario.</i>

308
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,086
<i>Sam knew better...</i>

309
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,753
<i>and he tried to hold me back. Tried.</i>

310
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,888
But I was too young...

311
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,025
too determined...

312
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:46,797
too stupid.

313
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,966
<i>A fight erupted.</i>

314
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:56,572
<i>I tripped or slipped on the slop on the floor.</i>

315
00:23:56,882 --> 00:24:01,012
<i>I was stunned, losing control.</i>
<i>Then all my wind left.</i>

316
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,382
<i>Your dad had to get involved.</i>

317
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,121
You okay?

318
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,688
<i>He fell right next to me.</i>

319
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:16,526
<i>I didn't know what the fuck was happening.</i>

320
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,570
<i>By then, other officers responded.</i>

321
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:25,799
<i>I just held him till he died.</i>

322
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:29,603
In my arms...

323
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,813
at the hands of my stupidity.

324
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:12,354
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

325
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:16,260
It's just I have to go home
to my daughter looking like this.

326
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:19,388
Diane, when I heard you got hurt,
I went crazy.

327
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,062
- Tim, don't.
- Don't what?

328
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,736
Don't be honest?

329
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,268
I've been thinking or feeling...

330
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,677
I know I've been all over the place
and back with this thing.

331
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:38,477
But maybe we could try it again. Together.

332
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,948
If I didn't have this golf ball on my head...

333
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,820
I would think that was more political
than romantic.

334
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,621
What do you mean by that?

335
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,026
If it isn't the lovebirds.

336
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:07,244
I knew a man who worked on Wall Street...

337
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:10,509
wore a bra and panties
under his Brooks Brothers suit.

338
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:12,345
Every day, he'd sit in meetings...

339
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,908
making harsh decisions
and cold business deals.

340
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:19,253
Yet underneath, he felt pretty. Oh, so pretty.

341
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,286
- Done.
- And?

342
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:28,561
I'm telling you, Mr. Nappa,
and I'm not prone to hyperbole...

343
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:32,297
but this may be the greatest true-crime book
since <i>In Cold Blood</i>.

344
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:35,039
Really. I never read that.

345
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,772
It was chilling. This is better.

346
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:40,869
We're gonna send this
to that literary agent right now.

347
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,642
Be careful.
If any of the other wiseguys find out...

348
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:45,945
I wrote a book about the Mob, we're dead.

349
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:49,454
I'll be careful.
And to celebrate, I want to make dinner.

350
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:52,251
And I think we should
get dressed to the nines.

351
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:55,020
- Come on, please.
- We'll see.

352
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,993
Officer, I'm not feeling very well.

353
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:06,203
Would it be possible for me to go to the ER?

354
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:26,948
Give him the coin.

355
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:32,593
Your friend's gonna take care
of that other matter for me, right?

356
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:36,927
Fucking rat.

357
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:51,246
- Did I overdress?
- Jesus.

358
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:57,881
- You look a lot like my ex-wife.
- Thanks.

359
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,224
That's not a compliment.

360
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,857
- Sit.
- That's nice.

361
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,724
- Pour this.
- Wine.

362
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,335
You're not the only one
who can move merchandise.

363
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,772
There you go.

364
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:16,804
And me.

365
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,211
To your book, to your life,
and the successful completion of both.

366
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:26,176
- I ain't dead yet.
- No, you're not.

367
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:32,313
Pretty good.

368
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:35,888
In his day, Antonio Nappa was a great man.

369
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:40,023
He was like a father to me.

370
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,667
- Well, more like an uncle.
- Lights out!

371
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:10,361
Good citizens of Gotham City
have to be the dumbest fucks on the planet.

372
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,531
<i>They got Batman and Robin</i>
<i>saving their asses...</i>

373
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,725
<i>from the Riddler, Joker and such.</i>

374
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:18,998
<i>They also got millionaire Bruce Wayne</i>
<i>and his ward Dick Grayson...</i>

375
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:21,665
<i>in the headlines every day.</i>

376
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:25,442
Batman and Robin. Bruce and Dick.

377
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,077
You mean to tell me
nobody ever put two and two together?

378
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,890
I wanna see the warden.

379
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:46,030
- What for?
- My business.

380
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:50,962
Adebisi, you ought to know by now
that your business is my business.

381
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,099
- I wanna file a complaint.
- About?

382
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,507
Tim McManus.

383
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:08,682
You're accusing McManus
of sexual harassment?

384
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:10,220
That's right.

385
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:12,781
What'd he do to you?

386
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,484
Not me. Kenny Wangler.

387
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,586
Yesterday, he touched Kenny's penis.

388
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:21,897
Officer...

389
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:24,796
bring Wangler in.

390
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,769
Sit down.

391
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,907
This is a very serious charge.

392
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:38,949
- And if I find out you're lying...
- I ain't lying.

393
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,349
The burden of truth is on you.

394
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:47,685
It ain't like I ain't had to deal
with guys in here groping on me.

395
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:51,751
I just been all fucked up lately,
sad about my life and whatnot.

396
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,828
McManus puts his arm around my shoulder
like a friend...

397
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,994
only it's not like a friend.

398
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:01,527
I was gonna just blow it off,
but Adebisi was like, "Don't."

399
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:05,104
He says what goes on with us prisoners
is one thing...

400
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:08,679
and what goes on with McManus
is something else.

401
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,344
- He said what?
- That you fondled him.

402
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:18,352
That is complete horseshit.
I tried to comfort him.

403
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:23,250
You're not taking any of this seriously,
are you?

404
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:26,825
Claire Howell accusing you
of sexual harassment.

405
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:30,263
- But she's full of shit, too.
- Yeah.

406
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,800
I'd like to know when it stops.

407
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:36,440
When it stops
being everybody else's problem.

408
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,700
- You make it sound like I'm a sex addict.
- Maybe you are.

409
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:43,441
Since the day you came to Oz,
I've watched you jump in and out of beds.

410
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:47,815
I held my tongue, even though I thought
what you were doing was pretty disgusting.

411
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,478
Wangler's lying.

412
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:53,485
Probably. But then, maybe there are other
inmates who never stepped forward.

413
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:55,685
You know what, I don't know.

414
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,461
And I don't know how to find out.

415
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,927
But if this is true...

416
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,432
you're finished here.

417
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,733
- Rick Donn?
- Yes.

418
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,668
I'm a big fan of your news program.
Very hard-hitting.

419
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:19,873
Thank you. You said on the phone
that you have a story for me?

420
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:23,520
Yes. It's all about sex.

421
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:39,763
Can we get a comment from you
about this sexual harassment charge?

422
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,135
Get out of my office!

423
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:44,334
<i>In an exclusive,</i> Channel 2 News
<i>has learned that Tim McManus...</i>

424
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:46,843
<i>the unit manager</i>
<i>at Oswald Correctional Facility...</i>

425
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:50,039
<i>has been repeatedly accused</i>
<i>of sexually harassing both inmates...</i>

426
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:51,878
<i>and correctional officers.</i>

427
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,580
<i>McManus was initially accused</i>
<i>of harassing a female officer, Claire Howell.</i>

428
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:01,055
<i>The State's attorney has confirmed that</i>
<i>the Howell case was settled out of court.</i>

429
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:03,756
Oh, boy, Miss Sally.

430
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,794
Do you think her boobs are real?

431
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,632
They're taking Wangler to gen pop now.

432
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:18,839
- Called your lawyer?
- Yes.

433
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:23,140
- And she said?
- Be patient.

434
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,574
Go about your life.

435
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,718
Act normal.

436
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:33,454
Acting normal is what got me into trouble
in the first place.

437
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:39,196
- It's gonna be all right, man.
- Yeah.

438
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:02,585
Hello, I'm Tim McManus.

439
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,647
Yes, hello. I really appreciate your coming...

440
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:10,058
taking time out of what I know
is a busy, busy schedule.

441
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,893
To tell you the truth, I'm very curious
as to why you asked me here.

442
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,399
Please be seated.

443
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,561
- Would you like some tea?
- No.

444
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,238
- May I call you Tim?
- Sure.

445
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,577
Tim...

446
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:31,415
in the past few weeks
I've suffered a series of stunning blows.

447
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:35,112
- Richie Hanlon's murder.
- Yeah, we're still investigating.

448
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:38,322
And yesterday, my new lawyer,
who is court-appointed...

449
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,585
and who I do not like at all...

450
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,993
told me that the State Supreme Court
rejected my final appeal.

451
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,922
Next Thursday is the date set for...

452
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:51,899
the execution.

453
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,370
It's the first time
I've said that word out loud:

454
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:02,106
"The execution." My execution.

455
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:07,776
The warden informed me
I may choose the means in which I will die...

456
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:10,480
and I was hoping you might help me
pick one out.

457
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:11,749
Me?

458
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,189
Richie always spoke so highly of you.

459
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,384
Said you were a good man.

460
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,587
Did he?

461
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:21,329
If you were going to die,
which way would you choose?

462
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,672
I'm not sure.

463
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:32,433
They say that lethal injection
is the least painful.

464
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,740
Pain is definitely part of the consideration.

465
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:37,338
- I would say the only consideration.
- No.

466
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:40,276
The style in which I die...

467
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:44,751
must have a sort of lyricism,
if you will, some significance.

468
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,351
There's the gas chamber.

469
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,190
They say the gas turns your skin green.

470
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,730
How about a hanging?

471
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:00,834
When you die, your feet do a little dance...

472
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,998
a little dance of death.

473
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,501
Richie was right about you.

474
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:09,309
A hanging, that's perfect.

475
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,616
I want to go out of this life dancing.

476
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,447
Thank you, kind sir.

477
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:23,092
You know, Richie had a little crush on you.

478
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:24,889
Did he?

479
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:29,793
And I can see why.

480
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:31,963
Officer.

481
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:44,106
You mustn't despair
over this sexual-harassment thing.

482
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:46,343
You know about that?

483
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:49,416
Even on death row, rumor lives.

484
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:13,066
Next item, puncture-resistant vests. Diane?

485
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:16,273
We all know
that attacks on COs are on the rise.

486
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,644
One every hour, 10,000 a year.

487
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,819
These vests, they're similar to the Kevlar
ones worn by the cops on the street...

488
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,515
except these are shank-proof
as well as being bulletproof.

489
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,151
They also cost $400 apiece. I don't have
that kind of money in the budget.

490
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:30,717
You ready for this?

491
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:34,060
Gloria Nathan just examined
Shirley Bellinger. She's pregnant.

492
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,004
Holy fuck.

493
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:52,745
Cyril, could you please
settle the fuck down?

494
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,648
- I'm boxing.
- Yeah, I know.

495
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:58,420
- O'Reily.
- Yo, slow down.

496
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:01,720
Cyril, isn't it about time
for <i>Miss Sally's Schoolyard</i>?

497
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:05,057
- No.
- Cyril, go outside and wait, all right?

498
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:07,353
Cyril, please.

499
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:11,295
O'Reily, who you betting on
in today's fight, Khan or the faggot?

500
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:12,802
Neither. I'm sitting this one out.

501
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,804
You've been on the winner
every match so far.

502
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,601
How come you decide to sit this one out?

503
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,232
'Cause whoever wins today's fight...

504
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:21,836
has to fight my brother next week.
I don't want to bring on a jinx.

505
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,346
Never took you for superstitious.

506
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,507
I'm a man of logic, I'm a man of planning.

507
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,416
I consider every detail,
I factor in every possibility.

508
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:29,746
Then I flip a coin.

509
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:33,154
Okay, if you were gonna bet,
who would you bet on?

510
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,354
All right.

511
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,390
Khan, he's got the power and discipline.

512
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:38,793
So you're saying the Muslim?

513
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:42,128
- Cramer's got the speed and the style.
- So you're saying the faggot?

514
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:45,729
Look at that fucking retard, Cyril!

515
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:47,634
Yo, Cyril.

516
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:50,135
Cut it out, man!

517
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:57,781
- Knock it off!
- Cyril, stop it!

518
00:38:58,349 --> 00:38:59,441
Fucking fruitcake.

519
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:00,575
- Stop.
- What?

520
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:01,641
I'm boxing.

521
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:05,416
Sorry about that, Officer Murphy.

522
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,357
Ever since he beat Pancamo,
my brother's been a little frisky.

523
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:11,884
- You, save your fists for the ring, all right?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:13,988
Watch your brother, O'Reily, okay?

525
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:17,157
You don't want him disqualified
from the championship...

526
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:19,430
'cause he ended up in the hole.

527
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:24,498
What the fuck were you thinking?

528
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,741
When I fight, people cheer, right?

529
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:28,904
- Yeah?
- I like when they cheer.

530
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,870
I'm not scared anymore.

531
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:34,111
That's good, Cyril,
but you don't have to fight all the time.

532
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:36,483
- I don't?
- No, you don't.

533
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,351
But, Ryan, you do.

534
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,386
The man you're boxing today...

535
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:50,696
represents all that's repulsive to our faith
regarding sexual desire.

536
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:54,134
Your victory over Jason Cramer
will be a victory for purity.

537
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:56,300
For righteousness.

538
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,068
For Allah.

539
00:39:58,142 --> 00:39:59,575
Hello, boys.

540
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:02,072
Go away.
We're in the middle of our study group.

541
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,944
How do you know
I don't want to learn about Islam?

542
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,381
Be serious.

543
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:10,517
Plenty of things have happened.
Beecher and Said.

544
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,681
Adebisi, get to your point.

545
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:16,124
My point is simple.
We all share the same skin...

546
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:17,826
they don't.

547
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:22,932
Don't beat Cramer because he likes boys,
beat him because he's white.

548
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,375
What do you want, Schillinger?

549
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:45,889
What I want is for you to focus
on something other than your dick.

550
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,785
You know, all this time
we've been in Unit B together...

551
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:51,954
you've never given two shits about me.

552
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:56,089
Now that I'm boxing that Muslim,
you're my best pal.

553
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,201
Must have been kind of hard
deciding who to root for.

554
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:02,738
Let's see, the fag or the nigger?

555
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,740
Then again, you know a lot more about
what it's like having your cock sucked...

556
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:08,540
than having an Afro.

557
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,275
You better watch your mouth, Tinkerbell...

558
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:13,544
or Khan's gonna win by default.

559
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:44,715
Kill that white bitch!

560
00:41:57,628 --> 00:41:59,391
Come on, man, you ain't tired.

561
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:49,107
Great work. Good job, Jason.

562
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:55,076
All right.

563
00:42:56,587 --> 00:43:00,353
From the judges' scorecard,
we have from Judge 1:

564
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,392
30-29, Khan.

565
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:04,884
Hell, yeah!

566
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,926
Judge 2 has it:

567
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,064
29-28, Cramer.

568
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:19,207
And Judge 3 has it, 30-29.

569
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:21,507
The winner by split decision:

570
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,269
Hamid Khan.

571
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,213
You see that?

572
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:35,424
People live their whole lives
thinking they know who they are.

573
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:38,954
<i>Husband, mother, son, lawyer, doctor...</i>

574
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:42,264
<i>pizza delivery boy, Baptist, Jew...</i>

575
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:46,029
<i>Muslim, Italian, Irish, WASP, black...</i>

576
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:48,731
<i>white, yellow, male, female.</i>

577
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:53,038
Then something comes along
and blows all those illusions to shit...

578
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,873
and you're left with the truth.

579
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:57,742
The lonely, terrifying truth.

580
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:37,710
Beecher, you are Said's bodyguard.

581
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:40,114
Sort of.

582
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,281
Not really.

583
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,190
I want to see him.

584
00:44:57,441 --> 00:44:58,635
Up and down...

585
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:00,370
life in Oz.

586
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:04,539
First I was king, then I was loony,
now I am king again.

587
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:06,941
Congratulations.

588
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:10,710
You and me,
we come at the world from different paths.

589
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:15,683
But there's something about you
I've always admired.

590
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:17,894
And me, you.

591
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:20,187
You are alone.

592
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,492
But it doesn't have to be that way.

593
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:26,096
Join me.

594
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:29,505
- I am very honored.
- But you refuse.

595
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:41,783
- They will kill you, you know.
- Probably.

596
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,178
Beecher can't protect you.

597
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:47,223
Probably not.

598
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,919
But I am ready to take whatever journey
Allah has chosen for me.

599
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:13,074
We could never hurt Said because
he always had goddamn bodyguards.

600
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,809
Now we get to kill him and Beecher.

601
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:20,623
- Can I sit here?
- No.

602
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:23,319
That's kind of stupid.

603
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:26,024
You need firepower.

604
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,502
Fuck you both.

605
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,806
You came to me wanting to learn
how to get closer to God...

606
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:44,041
because of your part
in the death of Andrew Schillinger.

607
00:46:44,115 --> 00:46:48,142
The guilt you carry
can only be lightened by forgiveness.

608
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:51,751
- I want to be forgiven.
- So you must forgive...

609
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,285
Schillinger and Keller.

610
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:02,065
- I can't.
- Beecher, you must.

611
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,125
What about you?

612
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,464
Don't you have to forgive Hamid Khan?

613
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,495
You'd better stay here.

614
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,465
Peace be unto you.

615
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,846
<i>As salaam alaikum</i>, my brothers.

616
00:47:56,987 --> 00:47:58,352
Let him in.

617
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,600
So what do you want, black man?

618
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:16,197
Five years ago, I was a very different man.

619
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:20,000
Selfish, ambitious, manipulative, arrogant.

620
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:26,316
One day I'm in Mecca, and the words
of the Prophet, praise be unto him...

621
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:30,078
filled me with the grace
and the glory of Allah.

622
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:33,848
I wanted nothing more
than to show others...

623
00:48:33,924 --> 00:48:36,916
the visions I had seen, the possibilities.

624
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:42,027
I studied, became a teacher and a leader...

625
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:45,129
but despite all my righteous intentions...

626
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:49,097
I was still selfish, ambitious, manipulative...

627
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:51,931
and even more arrogant.

628
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:57,581
What's happened
over the past few months...

629
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,240
has humbled me.

630
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,516
I have been humbled.

631
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,021
But not by you.

632
00:49:08,993 --> 00:49:10,221
By God.

633
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:14,388
Stripped of everything else...

634
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:18,495
I have nothing left but Allah.

635
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,767
And that is more than enough.

636
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:34,446
Peace be unto you, my brother.

637
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:01,142
What the hell is that?

638
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:05,747
In the name of Allah,
the magnificent and merciful...

639
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:08,216
I have witnessed that there is but one God.

640
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:13,080
Allah, I confess my faults.

641
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:15,719
Guide me to the right path.

642
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:19,329
My prayers, my life, my death...

643
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:21,993
are all for Allah.

644
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:29,795
Fuck!

645
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,906
That's not how you do it.

646
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:49,116
Oh, fuck.

647
00:50:52,196 --> 00:50:54,721
I loved Said's floor show out there.

648
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,722
I wanna talk to you.

649
00:50:58,135 --> 00:50:59,227
All right. What?

650
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:03,904
Said has helped me see things
a lot more clearly, Chris.

651
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:06,405
- And...
- Chris?

652
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:12,715
I forgive you.

653
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:16,219
And I ask that you forgive me.

654
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:29,532
- I love you.
- I love you.

655
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:31,857
Kiss me.

656
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:46,614
Faster. Come on.

657
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:49,584
Stop fucking around. This is important.
Faster, Cyril.

658
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:53,784
- O'Reily, come here.
- I'm busy. Faster, Cyril.

659
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:57,220
- There's money in the air.
- Keep working.

660
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:03,230
- I want you to help me kill Said.
- Said? He's nobody anymore.

661
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,667
Even so, I gotta think
of a way to bring him down.

662
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:08,864
Without Beecher suspecting, right, Keller?

663
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,668
Truth is you don't got to do nothing.

664
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:12,936
Rumor has it the
Aryans are gonna whack Said.

665
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,678
- You know when?
- I'd say right now.

666
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:26,187
I know you're gonna think this is bullshit...

667
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:30,451
but I feel badly
about my part in Andy's death.

668
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:34,163
I'm so sorry.

669
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,364
Losing a kid...

670
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:41,304
there's nothing worse.
And I wanna make it up to you.

671
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:43,662
How?

672
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:47,076
How the fuck
can you ever make that up to me?

673
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,677
You had another son,
you don't know where he is.

674
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:53,512
Through the private investigators
at my old law office, I could find him.

675
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:57,544
And that's supposed to even the score?
To make everything okay between us?

676
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:59,455
It's a start.

677
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,449
Beecher, you're crazier than I thought.

678
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,323
There's only one thing
that's gonna make this all okay.

679
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:10,298
You dead.

680
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:41,993
Lockdown!

681
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:46,596
Come on. Move it.

682
00:53:48,805 --> 00:53:51,273
<i>People are defined by three things:</i>

683
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,236
<i>Their heads...</i>

684
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,242
<i>how they think...</i>

685
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:03,812
<i>their hearts...</i>

686
