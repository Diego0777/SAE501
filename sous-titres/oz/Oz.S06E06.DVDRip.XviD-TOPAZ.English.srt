1
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,356
Fact:
2.5 million people die

2
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,366
in the United States
each year.

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,733
This, of course, is using
the dictionary definition of dead.

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,601
Toe-tagged
and body-bagged.

5
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,199
The number one cause of death
in America: Heart disease.

6
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,075
But not all heart disease
will leave you dictionary dead.

7
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,478
Some will kill you
and still leave you living.

8
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,713
Yeah, we got a whole lot
of walking dead in Oz.

9
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,860
Toby, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

10
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,093
Get the fuck away from me.

11
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,034
I heard what you've been
telling people.

12
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,936
You honestly believe I would
fuck you over just to get you back?

13
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,736
Don't play the wounded puppy.
I know who you are.

14
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,109
Toby, I love you.
I need you.

15
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,274
Oh, you're only
making it worse.

16
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,011
You've gotta believe me,
I'm innocent.

17
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,918
Okay.

18
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,218
Let's say I give you
the benefit of the doubt.

19
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,020
Let's say you didn't
do it on purpose.

20
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,585
The bottom line is,
I believe you would,

21
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,358
that you're capable of it.

22
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,456
That's the kind of man
I think you are,

23
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,491
and I wish to God
I'd left you on death row.

24
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,876
How's it goin' there, Chris?

25
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,546
Go away.

26
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,579
Ah, I can understand you
being a little testy.

27
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,484
Heard about what
went on in the gym.

28
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,392
It's a heartbreaker.

29
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,090
I'll survive.

30
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,894
I know you will.

31
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,401
You always do.

32
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,769
I remember when we first served
time together back in Lardner.

33
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,172
Christ, you were...

34
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,006
what, 17?

35
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,535
You came walkin'
into that cell block,

36
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,844
strutting really.

37
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,578
I said, "There is one
tough little motherfucker."

38
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,347
Oh, what is this, Vern?

39
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,513
Why the sprint down
memory lane?

40
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,046
Been thinkin' about
how close we were.

41
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,753
You protected me,
I sucked your cock. That was it.

42
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,523
I didn't love you.

43
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,996
I didn't love you, either.

44
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,331
But you gotta admit,

45
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,495
what we had was

46
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,471
more than nothin'.

47
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,236
So what? Too much shit's happened
between us since Lardner.

48
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,403
Yeah, because
of Beecher.

49
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,039
Now that he's done,

50
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,777
I'm saying
let's be friends again.

51
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,387
No cock sucking, just two guys
lookin' out for each other.

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,651
What do you say?

53
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,717
Okay.

54
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,972
Cancer.

55
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,477
The scariest fuckin' word
in the English language,

56
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,071
and the second-leading
cause of death.

57
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,481
It might be a zodiac sign,
but more likely

58
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,418
cancer will eat
your insides up.

59
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,853
Do you know why
it's so fucking scary?

60
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,983
'Cause the word itself
is a cancer.

61
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,551
Just the idea of it
can infect you.

62
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,359
The stress of it can spread
through your spirit.

63
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,424
The fear can turn
into the disease.

64
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,030
Yo, Rebadow, over here.

65
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,665
What do you want
today, Pablo?

66
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,972
I want to know what the fuck
your problem is, man.

67
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,001
I mean, why are you treating
Miss C. Like a bitch?

68
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,015
- She's not a bitch.
- That's right, she's a nice lady.

69
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,812
She's helping me
ride out my time

70
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,876
and you're bringing her
the fuck down. And the cancer?

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,582
It ain't that big a deal.

72
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,649
That's right, she told me yesterday.
I guess she needed someone

73
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,185
to talk to since you were acting
like my younger fuckin' sister.

74
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,322
Maria freaked when my ma got
breast cancer.

75
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,095
Of course, she was eight.
And mi madre?

76
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,399
She squashed that disease
like it was a cockroach.

77
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,636
I'll bet that's something
you can identify with.

78
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,589
Stella...

79
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,253
could you sit a minute?

80
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,543
I've dealt with a lot
of death in my life.

81
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,569
We all have.

82
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,282
But for me, this place
was never more a prison

83
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,116
than when Alex Jr.
Was dying.

84
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,884
I'm not dying, Robert.

85
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,521
You don't know that
for certain.

86
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,428
I'm sure as hell
more certain than you are.

87
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,837
And you may want to bone up
on your apologies,

88
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,104
'cause this one sucks.

89
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,737
I've been insensitive,
self-absorbed. I'm sorry.

90
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,408
I just couldn't deal with the prospect
of losing someone else,

91
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,440
someone I love.

92
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,346
You don't love me,
Robert.

93
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,754
Yes, I do.

94
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,627
And I promise
to be here for you.

95
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,190
I don't want you here.

96
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,500
Listen, I'm glad you understand
what I'm going through,

97
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,170
but your worries,

98
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,940
your concerns,

99
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,608
don't dissipate simply
because you fess up to them.

100
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,619
My lumpectomy
is in a couple of days.

101
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,589
As much as I appreciate
your feelings for me,

102
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,855
right now, you are just
not good to have around.

103
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,563
Yes.

104
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,032
You're right, of course.

105
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,530
But let me say
one thing before I go.

106
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,717
What, are you nuts?

107
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,226
Requesting a transfer
into gen pop?

108
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,355
Emerald City, especially?

109
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,888
That's where Said lived.

110
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,197
People there loved him.

111
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,227
Not everybody.

112
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,531
I'm tellin' you,
Idzik, this is suicide.

113
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,372
The worst thing
about being in prison,

114
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:40,078
the thing I didn't
factor into my equation...

115
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,610
we're in lockdown
so early,

116
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,816
I never get to see
the night sky.

117
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,785
I used to go
to the planetarium

118
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,921
every single evening.

119
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,591
Yeah, I'd peer
through the telescope and...

120
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,559
search the universe.

121
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,800
Looking for a sign.

122
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,604
But there never
was one.

123
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,583
Everything out there
is so still.

124
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,052
I didn't even see
a shooting star.

125
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,298
You have got
a lot of nerve!

126
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,324
I mean, bringing that scumbag
to Em City.

127
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,895
Omar, all we've got
in Em City are scumbags,

128
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,566
including you!

129
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,041
I mean, given
everything you've done,

130
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,636
starting with the cold-blooded
murder of Felicia Brown,

131
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,341
I don't exactly see
why you are so self-righteous.

132
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:46,374
McManus,
the man killed Said.

133
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,909
Oh, oh, I grant,
all right, all right,

134
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,819
you and the minister
didn't always get along.

135
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,291
That's true, but we respected
each other, most of the time.

136
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,693
It's an insult to Kareem's memory,
you bringing him here.

137
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,892
Just a few days ago you were
beggin' me to let you see him.

138
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,265
Yeah, see him, but not to have
to breathe the same foul air with him

139
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,466
- on a continuous basis
and shit, damn!

140
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,998
I want your promise
no harm will come to Idzik.

141
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,375
- Now swear to me.
- No!

142
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,781
Don't give me a reason to stick your
ass back in solitary permanently!

143
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,313
Yeah, okay.
Okay, okay, okay!

144
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,757
I won't hurt Idzik.

145
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,625
Good. Now, I want you
to meet him.

146
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,530
Huh?

147
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,659
Lemuel Idzik,
Omar White.

148
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,431
Omar's gonna be
your sponsor.

149
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,366
McManus only put us together
to fuck with my head,

150
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,172
and maybe yours, too.

151
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,906
Why would he do that?

152
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,005
He's looking to kick my ass
back to solitary, right?

153
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,346
So, he buddies us up
and shit, man, you know,

154
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,511
knowing there's gonna be
motherfuckin' trouble.

155
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,180
Between us, why?

156
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,555
Be... because I'm lookin'
to whack you, man,

157
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,583
for whacking Said.

158
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,232
Ah, I see...

159
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,530
perfect.

160
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,536
As the clock runs out,

161
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,630
the hands of fate
are applauding.

162
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,642
What... what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

163
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,839
I asked to be placed
in Em city

164
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,245
for one purpose

165
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,408
and one purpose only.

166
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,042
Yeah, what's that?

167
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,679
To find someone
to kill me.

168
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,261
Detective Tarnowski.

169
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,000
Hello, warden,
it's a pleasure.

170
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,940
What can I do for you?

171
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,806
I'm from homicide here,

172
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,438
replacing Detective McGorry
on the Wilson Loewen case.

173
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,345
Replacing McGorry, why?

174
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,748
She was rotated out of the unit,
happens all the time.

175
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,445
Not in the middle
of a major case.

176
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,421
A major case that, for all intents
and purposes, is over.

177
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,321
Let's go to my office.

178
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,791
Willy Brandt confessed to the murder.
What more do you need?

179
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,699
Brandt had no motive to assassinate
Loewen, except money.

180
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,669
Now, he admitted
he was paid to do the crime

181
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,934
- by a C.O., Adrian Johnson.
- Did you interrogate him yet?

182
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,237
Not formally,
but I talked to him

183
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,674
and he's guilty.

184
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,372
I want to find out why Johnson
ordered the hit.

185
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,381
Come on, warden,
the reasons are racial.

186
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,543
Loewen conspired to kill two little black
girls back in the '60s.

187
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,109
That would make
any man angry.

188
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,685
McGorry thought
something else was going on.

189
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,123
Didn't you read her report?

190
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,150
Sure, sure, between you
and the doorpost,

191
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,424
my lieutenant wants me
to wrap this stinker up fast

192
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,021
and that's
what I intend to do.

193
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,465
- So, let's find this C. O...
- Johnson.

194
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,332
Yeah, and put
this baby to bed.

195
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,360
Now, which way?

196
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,072
Do you know a prisoner
named William Brandt?

197
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,942
I know who he is.
I don't know him personally.

198
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,674
You never had
any contact with him?

199
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,774
Maybe once or twice. You know
the way shit flies around here.

200
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,786
- How about Lionel Kelsch?
- Same thing.

201
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,788
Did you ever meet
Mayor Wilson Loewen,

202
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,086
Either before or after he was
incarcerated in Oswald?

203
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,853
Nope.

204
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,918
Where were you
the night he was killed?

205
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,952
Home, in bed with my wife.

206
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,023
All right, officer,
thank you very much.

207
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,762
I'll get back to work.

208
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,636
I'd hardly call that
a comprehensive interview.

209
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,609
You got a problem
with this guy, warden?

210
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,545
No. Until now I considered him
one of my top C.O.'s.

211
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,207
Then why would you be
willing to take

212
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,614
the word of a convicted
felon over his?

213
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,950
I'd say Johnson is innocent.

214
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,890
Hello, Leo.

215
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,952
Ah, Perry, thanks
for coming by. Sit.

216
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,795
You know, I'm just starting
to use the internet,

217
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,996
starting to really
see its potential.

218
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,095
Leo, you said
this was urgent.

219
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,628
I'm a busy fellow.

220
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,106
I know you are.

221
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,076
Taking care of the governor,
that's a big job.

222
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,772
Let's face it,
Devlin is a needy man.

223
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,715
But you have been amazing,

224
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,877
cleaning up all of his
messes, his indiscretions.

225
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,285
What's this about?

226
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,017
Well...

227
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:22,221
I was just reviewing
officer Adrian Johnson's file.

228
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,129
I noticed he attended
the Middlesex Academy for boys.

229
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,156
Out of curiosity,

230
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,068
I went to their website
where they list the alumni.

231
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,971
You and he graduated
the same year?

232
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,168
Actually, he was a senior
when I was a freshman.

233
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,201
Ah...

234
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:45,013
we suspect Johnson paid Brandt
to whack the mayor.

235
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,381
What?

236
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,852
When the truth comes out,
it could do real damage to you,

237
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,321
to your career.

238
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,519
"Guilt by association."

239
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,256
I don't believe that Adrian's
connected to Loewen's murder,

240
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,493
but I appreciate
your concern.

241
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,965
Hmm.

242
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,902
Well, I'd just hate
to see a fine man like you

243
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,371
take an unnecessary fall.

244
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,588
What's up, Perry?

245
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,114
There's something
I need you to do.

246
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,389
- Kill Willie Brandt?
- Yes.

247
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,327
And Leo Glynn.

248
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,249
The third leading cause
of death in America is stroke,

249
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,514
or as they like to call it these days,
brain attack.

250
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,818
Serious.
That's a real medical term.

251
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,723
But who the fuck among us ain't had
their brain attacked?

252
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,160
And had some part of themselves
shut down, paralyzed,

253
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,324
which forces us to keep on
attacking back?

254
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,760
After Cutler died,

255
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,271
I started...

256
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,468
from my old ways,
you know,

257
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,604
bullying people
and waving my dick around.

258
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,615
I've crossed a lot of lines
in my life, sister.

259
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,049
But hurtin' my wife,

260
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,486
that was one line
I never thought I'd cross.

261
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:34,288
I always said I would never
lay a hand on Liesel.

262
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,022
You know,
being in the hole

263
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,793
gave me time to really think about
who I am and who I want to be.

264
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,664
All right.

265
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,400
Let's imagine that you could
do it over, the visit with Liesel.

266
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,635
What would you
do differently?

267
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,144
I'd talk.

268
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,807
Hug her... yeah.

269
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,779
Stroke her hair,

270
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,948
but not put her hand
inside my pants.

271
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,050
What the fuck
was I thinking?

272
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,323
And you would
talk about, what?

273
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,923
I don't know...

274
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,957
life.

275
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,937
Life without her,
how much it sucks.

276
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,839
And?

277
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,944
And that stuff
with Cutler, I guess.

278
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,509
What stuff?

279
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,250
You know what stuff.

280
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,157
Yes, James, but by articulating
what happened,

281
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,558
you accept it.

282
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,865
It's the first step
in healing.

283
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:00,510
I would tell my wife
that I was raped

284
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,380
and that's why
I didn't call her for so long.

285
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,521
And I would tell her
that I'm sorry

286
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,289
that I turned into
such a fucking fuck-up.

287
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:28,031
I, um, I came to Oz
nine months ago.

288
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,598
L... I was a virgin,

289
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,009
so, right away
I was targeted.

290
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:38,005
So, I kept
breaking the rules,

291
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,450
refusing to go to work

292
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,889
or take a shower,
shit like that.

293
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,450
They put me
on Special Restrictions.

294
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:52,157
I figured I'd be safe,
locked in my cell all day.

295
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,496
But then...

296
00:18:55,534 --> 00:19:00,335
they put this lowlife
in my cell, and he...

297
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,363
he beat me

298
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,740
till I said yes.

299
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,679
As he was doing it, I could hear
the TV in the C.O.'s office.

300
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,206
They were watching
"I Love Lucy."

301
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,414
Thanksgiving day,

302
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,550
six guys come into my cell
while I'm asleep.

303
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,362
They held me down and they put
a razor to my throat.

304
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,923
I asked for a kit to collect evidence
to prove what happened.

305
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,927
The C.O. Waited two days
to take me to the infirmary.

306
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:37,772
He said, he bought me
for two cartons of Kools.

307
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,437
By the time the nurse examined me,
there was nothing left to find.

308
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,813
L... I tried to ride,
but I ran out of money.

309
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,785
They took turns orally
and anally penetrating.

310
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,516
Someone wrote my mother.
She wrote the warden...

311
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,025
- I was rented out.
- "Please help my son."

312
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,857
- $3.00 for a blow job.
- The hack told me...

313
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,192
$5.00 for anal sex.

314
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,630
"Quit whining,"
to stand up and fight.

315
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,762
I saved the sleeping medication
the sister was giving me,

316
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,170
10 days' worth,
1,000 milligrams.

317
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,041
One night... after,

318
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:15,376
I took 'em all.

319
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,905
- I had no choice.
- I had no choice.

320
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,918
- I had no choice.
- I had no choice.

321
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,442
I had no choice.

322
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,147
I had no choice.

323
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,834
- You want any Morales' stuff?
- No.

324
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,837
I feel bad.

325
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,669
Enrique was really angry
at me when he died.

326
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,074
Well, it's probably
best he's dead.

327
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,271
He would've made
your life miserable.

328
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,578
That's true.
But he's got no family left.

329
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,585
They're gonna stick his body
in Potter's Field.

330
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,883
He ain't gonna know
the difference.

331
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:00,824
More and more, compadre,
I'm tired of all this shit.

332
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,828
I hear you, man.

333
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,559
Pancamo asked me
who was gonna lead El Norte.

334
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,432
What'd you say?

335
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,834
You.

336
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,838
Fuck that.

337
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,966
I told you, I'm keeping my head down till
my next parole hearing.

338
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,308
- Miguel.
- No.

339
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,980
- Alvarez, you got a surprise visitor.
- My girlfriend Maritza?

340
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,214
No. One Cathy Jo Cutler.

341
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,018
- She's the...
- Wolfgang Cutler's grieving widow.

342
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,218
Right.
Well, that's good.

343
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,659
Now, I can figure out
why he left me all his shit.

344
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,163
Yeah, good luck.

345
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,405
Hey.

346
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,382
Hi.

347
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,754
- Cathy Jo, right?
- Yes.

348
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,554
Thank you for seeing me.

349
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,787
Sure, of course.

350
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,022
Mr. Alvarez,
I'm here to ask you,

351
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,034
beg you...

352
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,262
Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,931
Okay, first of all,
Miguel, all right?

354
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,634
Let me just save you
a little speech or whatever.

355
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,905
I don't want
your husband's crap.

356
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,775
Oh.

357
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,338
I didn't know
you decided that.

358
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,316
Yeah, no, I just did.

359
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,377
I didn't sleep
a wink last night,

360
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,253
thinkin'
what to say to you,

361
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,451
the new owner of the bed
I was lyin' in.

362
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,893
You gotta do somethin'
for me first, okay?

363
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,897
You gotta tell me
why he did this.

364
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:50,425
Believe me, I've been
wrackin' my brains.

365
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,494
He did like
to fuck with me

366
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,664
when it came
to the purse strings.

367
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,936
Serves me right,
maybe, you know?

368
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,705
Why did I marry him
if I never loved him?

369
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,179
You're not married?

370
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,879
No, no.

371
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,547
Girlfriend...

372
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,580
she don't come around now.

373
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,457
Ah...

374
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,997
Well, um, I guess
that's all, then.

375
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,539
Thank you for being a better
husband than my husband,

376
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,444
if that makes sense.

377
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,108
Anytime.

378
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,584
Maybe I'll see you again?

379
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,419
You know, if I gotta
sign papers, whatever?

380
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,254
Okay, Miguel.

381
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,352
Cathy, all right.

382
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,498
- Say your prayers, Enrique.
- No, don't.

383
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,271
You're just like Martinez,

384
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,676
a nasty man
who deserves to die.

385
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,205
Thy kingdom comes,

386
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,309
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

387
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,321
Give us this day
our daily bread,

388
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,754
and forgive us
our trespasses

389
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,486
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

390
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,926
And lead us not
into temptation,

391
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,557
but deliver us
from evil. Amen.

392
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,404
You know, someday,
maybe soon,

393
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,637
these guys are gonna be
carrying my body out.

394
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,838
Nah, you're gonna
get paroled.

395
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,040
I've been thinkin'...

396
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,107
we should set up a meeting
between you and Luis Ruiz.

397
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,483
I hit the motherfucker
in the face.

398
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,250
He's not gonna come by
for afternoon tea.

399
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,587
Steve Dawkins is retiring
from the parole board,

400
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,559
and the rumor is that Ruiz
is gonna get the job.

401
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,221
You're gonna need him
to be on your side.

402
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:01,130
Fine. I'll do whatever
you two guys say.

403
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,192
I just don't want to end up
like Enrique Morales.

404
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,431
You know, I don't want
to end up as the landfill.

405
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,745
The autopsy report shows

406
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,186
that Enrique Morales
was suffocated, same as Martinez.

407
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,315
What, do you think
Dave Brass did the job?

408
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,225
I'm betting both murders
were done by the same man.

409
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,287
I need a list of all the patients
who were in the ward both nights.

410
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,888
I already checked,
there wasn't one.

411
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,129
Well, Morales had a lot of enemies,
could be two killers.

412
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,398
What about your staff?
Didn't they see anything?

413
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,701
Oh, you know the night shift
is skeletal at best.

414
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,764
Who was on duty?

415
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,571
Carol Grace,
Gerald Lesowski.

416
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,237
Carol Grace...

417
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,406
You know, Morales
said something to me about her,

418
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,008
that I should... check her background.
Where's she from?

419
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,383
Well, I don't know.
She was hired before I got here.

420
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,716
Pull her file.

421
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,323
Breathtaking.

422
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:08,196
That's a nice way to describe
someone or something, right?

423
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,361
What the fuck's so good
about having your breath taken?

424
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,031
Respiratory disease
clocks in at number four

425
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,836
on our little hit parade
and for good reason,

426
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,241
'cause regardless of who takes
your breath away,

427
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,507
be it four packs a day
or just one chick,

428
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,571
you're dead just the same.

429
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,208
Carol...

430
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,244
would you step into my office
for a minute, please?

431
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,620
All right, doctor.

432
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,253
Oh, hello, warden.

433
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,162
We looked at your
employment record, Carol.

434
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,426
Before coming to Oswald,

435
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,230
you worked at Millard Fillmore
Hospital in Buffalo

436
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,237
and St. Eligius in Boston.

437
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,397
What is this about?

438
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:51,535
You were fired from both
institutions. Why?

439
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,840
Jealousy.

440
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,778
The patients always
liked me the best.

441
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,647
We checked with the head
of nursing at both places.

442
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,311
A combined total of eight men
died on your watch.

443
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,753
And I checked our own
death certificates.

444
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,552
Three prisoners coded
while you were on duty.

445
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,684
What are you implying?

446
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,491
The police will take you
downtown, to the homicide unit.

447
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,327
All right, just let me
get my things.

448
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,493
Get out of my way, you!

449
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,196
Leave me alone,
you fucking bastard!

450
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,638
Leave me alone,
you Spanish cunt!

451
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,699
You fuckin' bitch!

452
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,404
Spanish cunt!

453
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,241
Let me go-ooo!

454
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,339
Accidents are the fifth
leading cause of death.

455
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,442
But you know as well as me,

456
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,283
there's no such thing
as an accident.

457
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,950
That's just some bullshit word we used
instead of blaming ourselves,

458
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,586
cause no matter what damn lie
you've been told,

459
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:47,189
we're the leading
cause of death... mankind...

460
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,496
and there's no cure for us.

461
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,434
It's the wages.

462
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,704
We cannot compete
with Arif.

463
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,836
I'm not worried, Burr.

464
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,905
Yeah, well, I can see that.
Explain why.

465
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,745
This is a prison.

466
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,151
There are 28,000 men sitting around
with nothing to do.

467
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:13,055
In economic terms, the labor supply
dwarfs its demand.

468
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,891
Yeah, but what makes a prison
is the pride inside,

469
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,987
knowing that
the other inmates

470
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,464
are making 20 times
as much as you are?

471
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,559
I'll say it again,
supply and demand.

472
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,070
You, my good friend, are gonna
do some more recruiting.

473
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,541
I already tapped
all of my soldiers.

474
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,202
They've gone AWOL on me.

475
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,234
Then you're gonna
have to branch out.

476
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,771
We can manage half-staffed
a couple of days, but that's it.

477
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,220
Life is about wherever
you gon' get to...

478
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,790
Suppose you wouldn't want
to trade that service spoon

479
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,627
for a telephone, O'Reily? Come on
over and join our company.

480
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,530
Yeah, that'd be
a dream come true,

481
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,125
pissing off strangers
at dinnertime.

482
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,261
Ain't no money
in the kitchen.

483
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,499
That's why my middle name
is "subsidize."

484
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,143
Hello, boys.

485
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,884
You fellas are new here
in Oz, right?

486
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,382
Haven't really had
a chance to settle in yet.

487
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,487
Well,
rather than get involved

488
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,694
in all the tribal shit
that goes on around here,

489
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,032
you need to know

490
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,369
that these days, Oz has
a better place to turn.

491
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,374
Mm-hmm.

492
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,137
It's called employment.

493
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,669
I heard about that.
You with that guy, Arif?

494
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,774
No. I'm with me,
Burr Redding.

495
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,614
Telemarketing.

496
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,053
I'm gonna try and get seconds
before they shut down.

497
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,918
For all the flak
it gets,

498
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,120
a sales position
in telemarketing

499
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,323
is a fine way to keep
yourself active.

500
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:03,266
I just remembered, I got
an appointment with Sister Pete.

501
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,264
What about you? You gotta go
jerk off or something?

502
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,036
No, I mean,
I'd take the job.

503
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,043
Oh, good boy.

504
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,705
But I'm dyslexic.

505
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,309
Here, clear my tray,
you squirmy little maggot.

506
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:44,966
Yo, boss man,
this be payday.

507
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,636
Yeah, l... I know.

508
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,908
Where's my money?

509
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,313
You're gonna have to wait
till the end of next week.

510
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,577
What?

511
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,642
I'm waiting on a check
from one of the publishers,

512
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,519
and when it clears, I'll have
your money for you. Just trust me.

513
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,648
Trust you?

514
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,956
Fuck.

515
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,053
Excuse me.

516
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,592
I'm telling you, poet, except
for the money I've been stealin',

517
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,796
I'm stone-cold broke.

518
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,464
We cannot wait
any longer, man.

519
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,700
We've got to get back
to selling tits.

520
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,301
I'm way ahead of you,
Reggie, way ahead of you.

521
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,642
Got a little contact
on the outside,

522
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,442
my nigger Sky Bar.

523
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,381
Shipment coming in today.

524
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,509
- All right, my dogs.
- All right?

525
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,713
Yes!

526
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,814
Hey, poet, it's too bad
about your friend Sky Bar.

527
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,587
- What about him?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

528
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,686
Got run over by a Chevy...

529
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,822
37 times.

530
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,613
Prisoner number
9-7-G-1-4-1,

531
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,876
Samuel Gougeon...

532
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:03,682
...convicted August 5th, 1997...
manslaughter.

533
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,656
Sentence: 19 years.

534
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,285
Up for parole in 10.

535
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:13,093
But let me tell you about the greatest
political campaign of all,

536
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,124
"Jesus is love," and God himself
is running for office.

537
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,636
Put that phone down,
choir boy!

538
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,731
That's just straight-up
fucking dumb,

539
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,835
using my workplace as a front
for your Gospel-mongering.

540
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,403
- I'm sorry, l...
- Oh, yeah, no shit.

541
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,075
And now,
you're going to repent.

542
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,277
Hmm.

543
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,015
I got a special job for you.

544
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,658
I guess this is one of those times
you don't ask,

545
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,254
"What would Jesus do?"

546
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,303
Make it fast.

547
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:57,434
For I acknowledge
my transgressions and my sin...

548
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,543
...is ever before me.

549
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:05,311
Bless me, oh Father,
according to thy loving kindness

550
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,946
and according to the multitude
of thy tender mercies.

551
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,086
It was you, wasn't it?

552
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,828
Come inside, Arif.

553
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,927
You're a pathetic,
corrupt man, you know that?

554
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,736
The corrupt part, I do.
I wouldn't say pathetic, though.

555
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:33,039
Vandalizing my business to repopulate
yours? What do you call that?

556
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,705
Downsizing
for the overall good.

557
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,274
This is your chance to go to Glynn
and tell the truth before I do.

558
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,013
Nobody's going
to anyone, son.

559
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,952
Business wasn't
very good, was it?

560
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,152
How would you know that?

561
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,890
On Wall Street,
we call it reconnaissance.

562
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,421
And you ought
to be grateful to me.

563
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,128
Now, you can collect
your insurance

564
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:02,435
and get all that money back
your Muslim brothers have lost.

565
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:06,136
And you can put all that
aggravation behind you.

566
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,270
Hmm?

567
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,943
Don't mention it.

568
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,009
- Did he confess?
- I need time to think.

569
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,647
What's there to think about?
He's guilty, right?

570
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,315
No.

571
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,155
What happened to our machinery
was an accident.

572
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,591
13 years after banging
the opposite side of the gavel,

573
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,465
the Supreme Court
did an about-face

574
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,630
and decided last June
to bar the death penalty

575
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,606
on retarded defendants.

576
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,269
"The large number
of states

577
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,108
prohibiting the execution
of mentally retarded persons

578
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,580
provides powerful evidence
that today

579
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,550
our society views
mentally retarded offenders

580
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,985
as categorically
less culpable

581
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,421
than the average criminal."

582
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,684
So, how's Cyril doing?

583
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,391
He hasn't defecated on himself
again and he's sleeping a lot.

584
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,627
How much is a lot?

585
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,829
In and out, all day long.

586
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,236
Oh, maybe that's a good thing,
you know, I mean...

587
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,571
we're still waiting to hear about
the stay from the State Supreme Court,

588
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,736
but, I don't know,
I mean, if we don't get one,

589
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,746
maybe he can just nap
up until the time

590
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,475
when they put him
to sleep for good.

591
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,278
Ryan,

592
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,844
lethal injection isn't
just falling asleep.

593
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,118
What do you mean?

594
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:29,183
It definitely makes execution
easier on the public,

595
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,195
easier on the staff,

596
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,596
but we don't really know
how painful lethal injection is.

597
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,566
What I can tell you
is a little-known fact

598
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,502
- that it was invented by the Nazis.
- What?

599
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,335
Hitler's personal physician
devised the procedure

600
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,068
as a means
to kill off children

601
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,874
- and eventually used it on adults...
- Hitler?

602
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,506
Given the concern
those bastards had for mercy...

603
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,449
No, I just... I just want what's best
for Cyril, that's all.

604
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,412
Well...

605
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,424
I was wondering if maybe

606
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,756
the electric chair wouldn't be
the better way to go.

607
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,229
The chair? Why not just feed him
to the fuckin' lions?

608
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,732
Think about it.

609
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,291
I mean, he's had
electroshock therapy,

610
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,532
which isn't such a far cry
from electrocution.

611
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,132
I mean, at least in his mind
it wouldn't have to be.

612
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,804
By now, he's used to the straps
and the electrodes.

613
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,406
Just tell him he's going in
for a special session.

614
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,348
He might never know
the difference.

615
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,814
Fuck.

616
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,004
Hey.

617
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,575
Psst. Come on, Cyril,
wake up.

618
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,548
Hmm.

619
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,683
So...

620
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,319
you want the good news
first or the bad news?

621
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,352
- The good news.
- All right.

622
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,091
The good news is

623
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,032
you're gonna have your last ECT
session in a couple of days.

624
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,195
Why is this
the last session?

625
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,900
Well, because you've been
such a champ so far, you know.

626
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,601
And because
you've been so great,

627
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,110
they're gonna
move you back upstairs.

628
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:30,045
They're gonna fix up
your cell all special-like

629
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,743
and they're gonna
give you a TV, hmm?

630
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,985
- Really?
- Yeah.

631
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,080
I can watch what I want?

632
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,820
What we want, bro.
I'm gonna be there with you.

633
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,055
- You are?
- Yeah.

634
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,621
And um...

635
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,031
they're gonna make you
this big dinner

636
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,900
where you can eat
whatever you like.

637
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,134
I can have
a Fluffernutter?

638
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,970
You can have
two Fluffernutters.

639
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,206
I can have
two Fluffernutters.

640
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,877
So, you want to hear
the bad news?

641
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,011
All right.

642
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:16,190
They've got to...
they've got to cut your hair.

643
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,923
Why, I like my hair?

644
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,931
I know you do, buddy,

645
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,298
but for this last session,
they've got to cut it, I'm sorry.

646
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,963
Will it grow back?

647
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:39,139
Homey, you put
Rapunzel to shame.

648
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,208
It's gonna grow back,
right, Ryan?

649
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,550
Yeah, right.

650
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,851
Fingernails gonna grow
down there, too.

651
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,586
Gonna go from
Rapunzel to Elvira.

652
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,891
Yo, homey,
come on, man.

653
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,726
Just focus on the hair,
all right?

654
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,426
We don't need
a color commentary, okay?

655
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,197
Actually,
you know what?

656
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,431
Let me get
a few snips in.

657
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,997
I've been wanting
to do this for years.

658
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,305
Holy shit.

659
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,952
Goddamn it, Cyril,
I can see your face again,

660
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,718
you handsome fuck.

661
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,727
Ryan, look.

662
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,063
Listen...

663
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,935
I haven't been very friendly
since I got to Oz,

664
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,440
but now,
I've talked to Suzanne

665
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,567
and I'm aware
of how hard you've tried

666
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,704
to stop your
brother's execution.

667
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,738
I admire your efforts.

668
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,377
I want you to know
at the hour of his death,

669
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,846
everyone in Em City
will be with him.

670
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,327
Oh, yeah? How?

671
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,159
You'll see.

672
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,433
Let's go, O'Reily.

673
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,604
Any word yet from
the State Supreme Court?

674
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,014
No. You'll stay
in your brother's cell tonight

675
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,814
and when they take him downstairs,
we'll bring you back here.

676
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,650
I was wondering
if at the time of his death,

677
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,714
- you know, I could be alone?
- Stay in your pod.

678
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,989
L... I was thinking maybe I could walk
in your meditation maze.

679
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,428
All right.

680
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,333
Following a particularly
heated trial,

681
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,269
which seems to have only
magnified the disagreement

682
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,830
on the execution of
the mentally challenged.

683
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,604
So, this afternoon
at Oswald penitentiary...

684
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,608
- What was that about Oz?
- Nothing.

685
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,025
Why does that man keep watching me
and taking notes?

686
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:41,521
It's part of the last ECT session.
They always do that.

687
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,230
I think I have
a stomach ache.

688
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,438
It's all that fluff
and stuff, you big freak.

689
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,103
Hey,

690
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,907
what do you say we lie down
for a little while,

691
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,414
you know, get a snooze in?

692
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,735
I forgot to ask for Rolaids.

693
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,576
Are you okay, Ryan?

694
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,582
Yeah.

695
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,312
As long as you are, buddy.

696
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:52,324
Each individual state has to decide
if a person is retarded or not,

697
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,167
meaning a murderer could get
a life sentence in Maine

698
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,866
where he's considered
retarded,

699
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,035
but the gas chamber in lowa
where he's normal enough to die.

700
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:04,605
Same guy,
same problems, same crime,

701
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,172
two opposite fates

702
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,117
depending on which invisible
state line he crosses.

703
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,951
Guilt and innocence,
hell, one's entire identity

704
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,050
is now a matter
of geography.

705
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,328
Uh... one thing
I didn't tell you, Cyril,

706
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,201
there's going to be other people
there today watching.

707
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,397
Who?

708
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,704
Oh, let's see... the warden,

709
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,334
uh, Sister Pete,

710
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:37,006
Ma, Dr. Nathan,

711
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,914
and a few other people
you probably won't recognize.

712
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,111
Oh.

713
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,414
Are you gonna be there?

714
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,159
No, I want to,
but I can't.

715
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,597
Why?

716
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,203
Daddy said,

717
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,146
"It's not good
for big boys to cry."

718
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,513
Yeah, well, you know what?

719
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,576
Dad was wrong,
and I was wrong.

720
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,454
We were all so fucking wrong,
Cyril. Man, I'm so sorry.

721
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,133
Did I do something?

722
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,899
No.

723
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,532
No.

724
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:41,408
Dr. Nathan, she said
I got this condition, right?

725
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,504
And...

726
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,538
the only way for me to...

727
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:48,574
cure myself is to cry.

728
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,246
You know, it's got
nothing to do with you.

729
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,278
I'm sorry.
Don't be scared, okay?

730
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,595
Whoops, I think
I got gas from dinner.

731
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,738
- Mom!
- Hi, ahem...

732
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,245
- Any word from Zelman?
- No.

733
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,312
Hey, hello.

734
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,343
You look pretty.

735
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,748
Sit down.

736
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:31,124
I want to teach you this little
prayer that I know.

737
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,686
It goes something
like this, it goes,

738
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,292
"Lord Jesus Christ
have mercy..."

739
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,325
Hey.

740
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,961
There's probably not
a chance I can get

741
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,472
a copy of that journal
you're writing in, can I?

742
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,475
Afraid not.

743
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,603
No, just a... you know,

744
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,307
one quick stop
by the copy machine, you know.

745
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,112
No one's got to know, I swear
to God. I won't show it to anyone.

746
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,778
I promise.

747
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,712
Your time is up.

748
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,261
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

749
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,930
Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy
on me.

750
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:19,170
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

751
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,074
Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy
on me.

752
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,012
Hey, come on,
we have to go.

753
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,038
Amen.

754
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,820
Hey.

755
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,853
Who loves you, man?

756
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,526
- You do.
- Oh, that's right.

757
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,263
More than you'll
ever fuckin' know.

758
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,930
Listen, I just need you
to relax, okay?

759
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,464
You know how
you get scared.

760
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,500
You just think
about me, all right?

761
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,445
Okay.

762
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,005
My boy.

763
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,657
What?

764
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,287
Nothing.

765
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,271
These are the clothes
you asked for.

766
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,106
I didn't ask
for any clothes.

767
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,135
Is that Ryan's shirt?

768
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,546
He said I could wear it?

769
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,158
There's widespread agreement
that retarded people

770
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,252
are less accountable
for their crimes

771
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,229
than those
of average intelligence.

772
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,731
But if so,

773
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,233
something or someone
has to be held accountable,

774
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,998
has to pick up the slack and
take the rest of the blame, right?

775
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,234
After all, these victims
still die heinous deaths

776
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,742
and families still grieve.

777
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,176
If the retarded person
is not fully at fault,

778
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,806
then who or what shares
the responsibility?

779
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,784
God?
Human nature? Society?

780
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,788
Maybe the question is,

781
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,120
who isn't to blame?

782
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,755
Why do I have
to wear these?

783
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,263
Where are my shoes?

784
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,392
- Hello, Cyril.
- Hi.

785
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,732
Don't I need my shoes?

786
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,240
Yea, "Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

787
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,267
I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

788
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,008
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

789
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,848
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

790
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,183
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

791
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,188
My cup runneth over.

792
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:22,350
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life,

793
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,452
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

794
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,130
What the fuck
is going on?

795
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,132
(soft rock music playing)

796
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:19,627
Now is your opportunity
to make a last statement.

797
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,628
Huh?

798
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,516
(music continues)

799
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,065
Dick? Hi.

800
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,077
No, no reason not to go forward.
We're all set here.

801
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,009
(music continues)

802
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,705
Yes, this is Warden Glynn.

803
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,334
Uh-huh.

804
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,435
Right.

805
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,969
Okay.

806
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,252
By the order of
the State Supreme Court,

807
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,286
Cyril O'Reily
has been granted a stay,

808
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,459
based on newfound merit
in his appeal.

809
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,401
- Yeah!
- This sentence's been postponed

810
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,428
until further notice.

811
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,690
What happened?

812
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,488
What about
the special session?

813
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,320
Flashback to 1989

814
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,833
when the Supreme Court
first weighed in on this issue.

815
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:34,268
"Based on evolving
standards of decency

816
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:37,432
that mark the progress
of a maturing society,

817
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,635
there is not
sufficient evidence present

818
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:43,737
of a national consensus
against such executions."

819
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,578
Well, supposedly today,
there is.

820
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,641
Polls show
most Americans agree

821
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,778
that an adult with the mind
of a third-grader

822
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,685
should not be on death row.

823
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,317
But are we
a maturing society

824
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,453
with evolving standards
of decency?

825
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,691
Who's to say
we're any further along

826
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,461
than some cosmic equivalent
of third grade?

827
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:08,130
Who's to say, we, as a whole,
aren't retarded?

828
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,713
Thank you.
