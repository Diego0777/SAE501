1
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:49,205
Some people say the Bible
is the greatest story ever told.

2
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,242
The best story is:

3
00:01:55,407 --> 00:02:01,801
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl,
boy gets girl.

4
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,445
Yeah.

5
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,077
Boy meets girl.

6
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:10,236
That first moment

7
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:14,639
when every corpuscle in your dick
is percolating.

8
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:18,595
Of course, not everybody
has the same impulse.

9
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:22,955
What are you doing in my room?

10
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:26,039
Richie boy,
where you been hiding all day, huh?

11
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,276
Get off my bunk.

12
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:31,724
- l want you to suck my dick.
- Get lost.

13
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:34,959
You're a fag. You suck dick.
So what's the problem?

14
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,038
l suck the dicks l wanna suck,
so fuck you.

15
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,760
Richie, Richie.

16
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,316
You shouldn't be talking that way
to me.

17
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:52,358
- ls there a problem, gentlemen?
- No.

18
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:55,803
- Get the-- Get off me, damn it.
- Keep your mouth shut.

19
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:04,402
You better watch it, Richie.

20
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:09,684
What happened to Alexander Vogel
is gonna happen to you.

21
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:13,522
You're gonna wake up tomorrow
hanging by your ankles,

22
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,326
- dead.
- You killed Vogel?

23
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,637
Yeah. Me and Schillinger.

24
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,401
Now, suck my fucking dick.

25
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:27,126
Prisoner number 98H462,
Richard Hanlon.

26
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,162
Convicted June 3rd, '98,

27
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:35,445
possession and distribution
of controlled substance.

28
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,363
Sentence, eight years.

29
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,803
Up for parole in five.

30
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,363
Hey, Richie.

31
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:15,476
Yeah?

32
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:18,036
- Me next?
- What?

33
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,163
l was watching you
play Markie's pud horn. Me next.

34
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,601
Fuck you.

35
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,326
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

36
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:27,761
Man, did you see that?

37
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:34,164
- Who pushed him?
- Hanlon.

38
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,439
McManus, l swear,
he was coming on to me.

39
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:40,835
l shoved him away.

40
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,440
You're gonna be charged
with murder.

41
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,359
- Fuck.
- Officer.

42
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,755
Shit, shit. Wait.

43
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,637
lf l give you some information,

44
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,960
what kind of deal
can l get in return?

45
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:59,244
Well, that depends on
your information.

46
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:02,799
lt's about a murder. A real murder.

47
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:08,077
- A murder here in Oz?
- Alexander Vogel.

48
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,680
- Vogel?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,442
lf l tell you who killed Vogel,

50
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,639
can l get a lesser charge?

51
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,762
Well, that depends on
if your information sticks.

52
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,679
Here we are again, Schillinger.

53
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:24,919
Only this time,
l got proof that you killed Vogel.

54
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:29,046
- Proof?
- Your friend Mack confessed.

55
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,959
Horseshit.

56
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:35,166
He told another prisoner
that you and he did the deed together.

57
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,080
Oh, a jailhouse confession?

58
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,319
Please. Mack will deny it.

59
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:46,163
And it's the two of us, our word
against whoever the jabber is.

60
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:50,402
Mack's in the other room right now
spilling his guts out.

61
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,357
Like l said, horseshit.

62
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,317
And even if he was,

63
00:05:57,127 --> 00:06:01,359
do you think l would admit to you
that l did it?

64
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,123
ln your wildest fucking dreams,
would l ever give you that satisfaction?

65
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,365
No.

66
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,241
Take him out.

67
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,800
- Yeah?
- Listen up and listen good.

68
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,878
Some friends of mine
are very upset

69
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:27,959
that you tried to pin
a certain murder on them.

70
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:31,437
- For that, you're a dead man.
- Oh, Christ.

71
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,485
However,
they're offering you an alternative.

72
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,922
Since you're already in here
for one killing,

73
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:40,636
they suggest you also confess
to Alexander Vogel's murder.

74
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,160
Take your chances with the court.

75
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:47,355
At best, you get life.
At worst, you get the death penalty.

76
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:51,361
lf you get life,
my friends will let you live.

77
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,803
lf not, you're a dead man anyway.

78
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,362
So choose.

79
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,517
Tell Glynn l wanna see him.

80
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:13,635
l have a confession to make.

81
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:17,079
Good boy.

82
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,516
Augustus.

83
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:58,317
- lt's almost time for the hearing.
- l got lost in my head, man.

84
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,915
What were you thinking?

85
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:03,759
l was thinking that

86
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:06,597
if all goes well,

87
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,483
l might actually be rolling out of Oz.

88
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:17,359
That by sundown,
l could be home with my wife.

89
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,757
l could be in my house
drinking a cold beer,

90
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,646
watching the Yankees and the Orioles.
You know what l'm saying?

91
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:24,877
You know, by sundown...

92
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,203
...l could actually be free, man.

93
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,926
Hey.

94
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,644
Hey.

95
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:43,281
Formal hearing
of case number 9661 33,

96
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,802
Hill v. the State.

97
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,355
Mr. Said.

98
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,005
Your Honour.

99
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:03,119
lt is already a matter of public record
that Richard Kibler,

100
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:06,962
while serving as a judge
on the state criminal court,

101
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:11,279
took money in exchange for
giving out more lenient sentences

102
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:13,563
to three convicted murderers.

103
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,005
Mr. Said claims bias
against his client

104
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:21,762
because he neither gave bribes
nor knew of that possibility.

105
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,237
But that in itself is not bias.

106
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:28,479
The defendant has got to show
the actuality,

107
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,002
not the appearance of bias.

108
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,362
Well, at the same time
that Kibler was accepting bribes,

109
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,483
my client came before him.

110
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:37,365
Now, my client was found guilty

111
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,837
and sentenced by Kibler
to life imprisonment

112
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:43,760
with the possibility of parole
in 20 years.

113
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:46,964
Your Honour, Augustus Hill
murdered a police officer in cold blood.

114
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,196
Objection.

115
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,801
The nature of his crime
has direct bearing on his sentence.

116
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,195
Overruled.

117
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,565
Mr. Said has asked the court

118
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:59,525
for an automatic reversal
of Hill's conviction

119
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:03,123
due to the circumstance
of Judge Kibler's conviction.

120
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,118
Due to the circumstances
of corruption,

121
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:09,075
that my client was denied
his fundamental right to a fair trial,

122
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:11,203
presided over by an impartial judge.

123
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,562
And that therefore, Augustus Hill

124
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,799
is entitled to an automatic reversal
of his conviction.

125
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:21,882
But there is no precedent
for the court to make such a ruling.

126
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:26,484
ln fact, to do so would, in effect,
create a rule of law

127
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:30,481
that is beyond
the court's jurisdiction.

128
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:33,400
Mr. Said, call your first witness.

129
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:34,962
Augustus Hill.

130
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,278
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

131
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,881
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

132
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,719
l do.

133
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:49,836
How's it going?

134
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,718
l can't tell yet.

135
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:56,399
This guy, Fortunato,
he's tough, he's good.

136
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,445
- And Said?
- He gets overruled a lot.

137
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,241
l don't know. lt's funny, man.

138
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:04,398
l'm more nervous now
than l was at my first trial.

139
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,046
Makes sense.

140
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,163
Then you'd never seen
the inside of a prison.

141
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:10,795
lncarceration was merely a concept.

142
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:11,956
Now you know the reality.

143
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:14,197
You know the price
if the verdict goes against you.

144
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,925
Augustus,

145
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,477
we need a smoking gun.

146
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:22,162
We need to find a convicted felon
who was asked to give a bribe, didn't,

147
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,283
and then was sentenced unfairly.

148
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:29,157
- How do you know that one exists?
- And if he does, how do you find him?

149
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,806
lt's a needle in a haystack.

150
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:33,197
Quickest way to find the needle,

151
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,323
burn the haystack.

152
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,997
What the fuck does that mean?

153
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,797
Here you go, my brother.

154
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:10,963
A list of names of all the murderers
convicted by Kibler.

155
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,960
Now, if one of them testifies
that they didn't offer a bribe

156
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:18,403
and we show
that they were sentenced unfairly,

157
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,159
we prove bias.

158
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,158
We ain't got time
to contact all these people, man.

159
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,477
We in the middle of the trial.

160
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,204
We should've thought of this
a week ago, man.

161
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:36,564
We've already told you,
no special phone privileges.

162
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:38,763
Let me use the fax
to contact the men on the list.

163
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:39,916
No.

164
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:43,397
You think l'm gonna help you turn
this prison into The People's Court?

165
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,877
You win this one, you'll be reopening
the case of every prisoner in here.

166
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:50,039
And is that wrong?
To strive for justice?

167
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,357
- Justice?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:56,281
Crooked judge or not,
Hill shot a cop.

169
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,802
Officer.

170
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:04,047
Whether l win or lose this case,
warden,

171
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,438
l am never gonna stop
helping my brothers fight for freedom.

172
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:22,799
He said no. Again.

173
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:24,641
So l'm gonna call my publisher,

174
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:27,241
get him to contact the lawyers
of all the men convicted.

175
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,797
Still gonna take the one thing
we ain't got: time.

176
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,356
Then we create time.

177
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:37,242
lf the decision goes against us,
l'll appeal.

178
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,601
On what grounds?

179
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,645
The only reason Judge Lema is
overruling all my objections is racism.

180
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:46,319
lt couldn't be because most
of your objections are stupid, right?

181
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,125
No. lt couldn't be because
maybe, you know,

182
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,721
you not as good a lawyer
as you think you are.

183
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:52,885
You wanna replace me?

184
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:54,924
You wanna get Beecher
to take up our cause?

185
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:56,566
Our cause?

186
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,764
This is not our cause,
this is my fucking life.

187
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:00,962
l am not you, man.

188
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,163
l don't wanna be a martyr
or a fucking saint.

189
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,158
All l wanna do
is get out of here and be free.

190
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,876
Either you can do that
or you leave me the fuck alone.

191
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,956
Goddamn it!

192
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,844
Does anyone else have anything to say
before l give my ruling?

193
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,683
Yes, Your Honour, l do.

194
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:26,806
Make it snappy, Mr. Said.
l've got a long ride home. Rush hour.

195
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:31,316
Because my client and l
are prisoners

196
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:35,116
and certain restrictions are placed
upon our time and our resources,

197
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:38,438
we do not have the opportunity
to obtain further evidence.

198
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:42,756
- Duly noted.
- One more thing, Your Honour.

199
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,322
We'll probably never know

200
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,285
what Judge Kibler thought
about Augustus Hill.

201
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:53,440
But we have a pretty clear picture
about what he thinks about justice.

202
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:54,676
Thank you.

203
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,801
To the State's argument

204
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:05,677
that because there is no precedent
for reversing the conviction,

205
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:10,284
that this court would be ruling
beyond its jurisdiction,

206
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,438
l say, ''Bunk.''

207
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,164
How do precedents
become precedents

208
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:20,036
unless some judge sets one?

209
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:24,598
However, the State's view

210
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:28,601
that the defendant must show more
than the appearance of bias

211
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,120
rings true.

212
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:36,797
l have reviewed the transcript
of Mr. Hill's trial thoroughly.

213
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:42,485
At no point did Judge Kibler,
in word or deed,

214
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:48,040
act beyond the limits
of the rules of judicial procedure.

215
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:53,037
And the sentencing,
given the severity of the convictions,

216
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:57,166
does not appear to be unduly cruel...

217
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:00,045
...or unusual.

218
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:03,597
Therefore,
l rule in favour of the State

219
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:09,524
and deny Augustus Hill's motion
for a reversal of his conviction.

220
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,480
Do not lose faith, my brother.
This is just the beginning.

221
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:17,161
No. lt's over.

222
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,483
- Augustus--
- No.

223
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,444
l can't handle this shit anymore.

224
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,598
l told you before,
these things take time.

225
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,678
- The law is very--
- lt's not the law, man.

226
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:30,477
lt's not the law that l can't handle.
lt's the hope.

227
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:35,286
The hope is crushing me, man.

228
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:41,123
Hope? Hope is all we have.

229
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:46,556
No. All l have is Oz.

230
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,959
All right, who wants to go next?

231
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,595
- Hey, can l read a poem?
- Yeah.

232
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,485
Something l wrote.

233
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,639
The inside of my cell

234
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:07,437
See me be seduced by its serenity
ln my search for privacy

235
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:09,518
Behind the locked cages

236
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,599
The makers of the rules rise
But peace dies

237
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,804
Curses is kisses
And adoration is disses

238
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:19,516
ln this beautifully disgusting place
Where l see my forever

239
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,962
Call it Emerald City
Ex--

240
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,687
- Faggot, you done with your faggotry?
- Who you calling a faggot?

241
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,724
l'm calling you a fucking faggot,
you faggot.

242
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,081
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, hey, hey.

243
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,399
Now, you already started
one fight in here.

244
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:36,082
Next one's gonna be in gen pop.
Step back.

245
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,317
Go on, get out of here.

246
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,277
Wangler needs attitude realignment,
you know?

247
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,041
Well, he's pissed off because
l'm forcing him to come to class.

248
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,323
l don't get it. He was doing well
learning how to read.

249
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,796
- Now he's shut off completely.
- Adebisi's giving him heat.

250
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,639
So l'm trying to give him
room to move.

251
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,035
What about Poet?

252
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,563
- Kid's got talent.
- Listen.

253
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,361
Here's a tape recorder.

254
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:04,564
You record five or six of his poems,
give this back to me.

255
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:06,524
- Why?
- l got a plan.

256
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,845
Thank you.

257
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,559
- Have a seat.
- What do you want, McManus?

258
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:32,801
- l finished your book on the riot.
- l suppose you want my autograph.

259
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,076
l wanna talk to you about Poet.

260
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,600
There's some of his work.

261
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,285
l want you to contact your publisher,
show him those poems.

262
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,158
Do you remember the first time
l stood in your office, McManus?

263
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,441
You told me that my, quote,

264
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:01,919
my celebrity status wouldn't give me
any extra advantages inside of Oz.

265
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,995
And you reminded me of that
last week.

266
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,600
And now here we are,

267
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:10,282
with you taking advantage of me,
of my status.

268
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:14,235
This isn't about you, Said.
This is about Poet, his future.

269
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:16,967
No, it's also about you.
Having one of your students published

270
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:20,244
will get you press coverage
for your educational programme.

271
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,045
You'd look like a hero.

272
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,677
You have the opportunity
to help someone here, a fellow inmate.

273
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,838
l don't need you to tell me
when to help a brother.

274
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:32,239
Look, could we just put aside
all the bullshit between us for once?

275
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:38,158
Once.

276
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:47,286
- Let me get some, Adebisi
- No.

277
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,756
- l'm looking out for--
- Let me get some tits.

278
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,236
Come on, man, let me get some tits,
man. Come on, man.

279
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,284
- Hey.
- Let me get some tits.

280
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:57,007
Hey, you haven't paid us in weeks.
Fuck off.

281
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,316
Come on, man. Just hook me up.

282
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:01,320
Yo, yo, go write something, Du Bois.
All right?

283
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,200
Do you realise
you've beaten the odds in here?

284
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:29,280
- You've held on to your gift.
- Say what?

285
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,244
l've spoken to my publisher
about you.

286
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:33,443
- Publisher?
- Oh, yeah.

287
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,722
Very interested in your work.

288
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,242
--poetry-reading faggot.

289
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:41,397
Yeah, come on.
Come on, recite something, bitch.

290
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:42,636
Nice fucking life.

291
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,957
- Don't doubt yourself, my brother.
- Yo, Shakespeare.

292
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,879
- Come on, teach me poetry.
- They are a lie.

293
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,084
- Get up on that table and read.
- Sit.

294
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:58,356
Bitch.

295
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,116
- Let them mock you.
- Fuck.

296
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,676
- Bring your poetry-reading ass.
- ln the end, they will see.

297
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,803
Not if l jack
one of them motherfuckers first, man.

298
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:09,561
You listen to me.
You look at me, Poet.

299
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,560
You have a responsibility.
You have a calling.

300
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,319
Man, don't feed me
none of that bullshit.

301
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:16,045
Just tell me
what the fuck l gotta do.

302
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,925
Nothing.

303
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,399
Do nothing...

304
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,559
...except trust me.

305
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,518
Yo, Kareem, you was right.

306
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,599
You was right.
l'm about to get published.

307
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:34,925
- Congratulations, my brother.
- Hey. That's great.

308
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,601
- Yes, yes.
- Where?

309
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,077
lt's an anthology of poems
called Unheard America.

310
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:43,283
They're giving him
a featured appearance.

311
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:47,076
- That's terrific.
- And they're giving me cake.

312
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:53,005
Look at that.

313
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:55,963
Now you got two.

314
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,477
Tit me, man. Tit me, man.

315
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:06,003
What did you do to get this, bitch?

316
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:10,964
Hey, where did you get this?

317
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:13,163
- Poetry.
- Poetry?

318
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:16,239
Who the fuck pays for poetry?

319
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:17,999
Hey, yo,

320
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,842
a publishing house
put some of my work in their book.

321
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,445
No shit? Wait, wait.

322
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,360
Teach me to write.
Oh, yeah, teach me to write.

323
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:29,960
l can't teach you to write.

324
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:33,881
l want to write rhymes
about Nigeria.

325
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:38,086
Don't nothing rhyme with Nigeria.

326
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:42,240
Bitch, give me that.

327
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:55,285
My, my, my, my, my, my-geria

328
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,322
What was the other one?
Help me, help me, help me.

329
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,000
- Cafeteria.
- Cafeteria.

330
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,637
- And Nigeria
- To release my ''diarrhoearhea''

331
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:13,165
- Cafeteria
- Cafeteria

332
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,239
- Get diarrhoea
- My ''diarrhoearhea''

333
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:20,243
Nigeria

334
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,836
Geria

335
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,725
Oh, shit, yeah.

336
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:40,359
Yo, what's happening, man?

337
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,438
You know,
l have seen Adebisi destroy others

338
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,245
with his own self-destruction.

339
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,763
Man, we was just--
We was just doing laundry, man.

340
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,880
We was doing laundry, man.
What the fuck?

341
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:03,676
You know--

342
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:07,283
You know, you're so fucking clean
and righteous, man.

343
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,961
You know what l'm saying?
l got demons clawing at my ass.

344
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:12,561
So do l, my brother,
but they can't take me down.

345
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,480
You must learn to fight with your will.
That is the shield of Allah.

346
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:19,923
- Man, they just keep coming.
- Delusions.

347
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:21,759
This is your reality.

348
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,236
Believe in his power.
Believe in his power to keep you.

349
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:27,080
Man, that's that bullshit, you know?
That's that bullshit.

350
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,044
- That's that--
- Believe.

351
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,322
Why?

352
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:31,920
l have taken it upon myself

353
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:35,363
to rally a network of eminent writers
calling for your parole.

354
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:40,636
- My parole.
- l'm telling you, my brother.

355
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:44,886
We're gonna turn you
into a symbol of justice in America.

356
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:50,405
You're gonna be like the phoenix,
rising, through your poetry,

357
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:52,717
from the ashes of a crack house.

358
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,917
- A symbol? Me? Shit.
- Yeah.

359
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,716
A crowd has gathered outside Oswald
Maximum Security Penitentiary

360
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:05,165
in growing support for Arnold Jackson,
an inmate whose poetry

361
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:07,602
has fomented a movement
of writers and artists

362
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,804
demanding that he be granted
a parole review.

363
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,277
The campaign to free Mr. Jackson
started with Foster Perry,

364
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,519
the publisher of an upcoming
anthology of marginal literature

365
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,882
titled Unheard America.

366
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,036
Many critics are saying

367
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:24,244
this is a commercial ploy
to create a sensation around the book,

368
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:25,806
but several figures in the arts

369
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:28,640
have committed their efforts
to Mr. Jackson's case,

370
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:34,598
claiming he is a rare talent lost inside
our country's barbaric prison system.

371
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:38,325
- Fuck.
- Damn right.

372
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:44,156
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl,
boy gets girl.

373
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,965
And that's the best part, right?

374
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,163
After all that shit that's come before,

375
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,477
the two lovers finally stare
in each other's eyes,

376
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:54,162
and...the story ends.

377
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:55,885
Only...

378
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:59,160
...what happens
after boy gets down with girl?

379
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:04,879
Well, he starts to get at her,
she starts to get to him.

380
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:09,404
Boy makes girl crazy and vice versa.

381
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,841
Man, this is great.

382
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:15,956
No work detail, no COs hassling me,
no punks up in my face.

383
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:19,278
l'm telling you,
there's an upside to dying, doc.

384
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:22,598
You're not dying.
The surgery was successful.

385
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,644
The lump in your breast
has been removed.

386
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:26,126
The chemo's doing the rest.

387
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,755
Yeah, so, what are the chances
of the cancer coming back?

388
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,999
Ninety percent of stage-two men
are alive after five years,

389
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:36,523
and 63 percent are alive
after ten years.

390
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:39,884
l'm up for parole in 1 1 years.
The way things go for me,

391
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,845
l'll get released
and...the tumour's back.

392
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:45,362
You're young.
You're otherwise healthy.

393
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:46,801
You'll be okay.

394
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,566
Ryan O'Reily's coming back
to Emerald City today.

395
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:23,842
Oh, yeah?

396
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:26,077
Been in the hospital
a long fucking time.

397
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,760
Must be something
really wrong with him.

398
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:30,043
l hear O'Reily had surgery
at Benchley Memorial

399
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:32,038
and now he's going through
chemotherapy.

400
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:35,040
Chemo, that's bad, man.
That shit does bad shit to you.

401
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,038
lt can also save your life.

402
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,479
What the fuck you looking at?

403
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,639
- Nothing, Ryan.
- Get the fuck out of here.

404
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:30,239
Hey, l want back in the kitchen.

405
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,763
- Forget about it.
- Schibetta, l'm not fucking around.

406
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:34,838
He says forget about it,
cancer boy.

407
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:40,202
- Faggot.
- O'Reily, you trying to look like us?

408
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:41,561
Yeah, l'm trying to be ugly.

409
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:45,039
People have been wondering
what exactly is wrong with you.

410
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,323
Scatz here says
it's cancer of the balls,

411
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,000
that the doctor cut them off.

412
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,566
But l say that can't be it.

413
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:54,203
Because you never had any balls
to begin with.

414
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,323
You know the rules, O'Reily.
You get in a fight, you go to the hole.

415
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:21,047
So send me to the fucking hole.
l've been there before.

416
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:22,640
l ain't afraid.

417
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:27,039
Yeah, well, in your condition,
you know, you're likely to get a cold,

418
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:30,040
then you die, and then
l got a shitload of paperwork to do.

419
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,322
That's funny.

420
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,718
Look, Ryan,
you've got six weeks of chemo left.

421
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:37,720
Okay? So we decided
you can stay in the ward until then.

422
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,116
Take him to the hospital.

423
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:14,836
Hey.

424
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,879
Hey.

425
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,285
How are you feeling?

426
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:20,960
Physically, fine.

427
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:24,517
But l gotta tell you, ever since riding
in the van on the way to surgery,

428
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:29,886
you know, being on the outside.
Since then, that's all l can think about.

429
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:31,605
You know, being free.

430
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:35,077
Doing the things that l miss.
Things that l can't do in here.

431
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:39,206
Like what?
What do you miss most?

432
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:42,366
Kissing.

433
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:46,358
- You miss your wife.
- l miss affection.

434
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:48,483
Any kind of affection.

435
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:54,160
Like just before the operation
when you took my hand,

436
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,363
the heat of your skin...

437
00:30:57,687 --> 00:31:00,645
...it sent a brushfire
through my body.

438
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,322
Funny, huh?

439
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:07,959
A simple thing like that.
Fingers touching fingers.

440
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:13,877
l wanna touch you.

441
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,842
l wanna kiss you.

442
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,478
Well, don't.

443
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,565
- Hello, Gloria.
- Hey.

444
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,436
What's wrong?

445
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:49,758
What makes you think
something's wrong?

446
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:52,839
Well, l'm a psychologist and a nun.

447
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,680
Usually, between the two,
there's something wrong.

448
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:58,402
You know, in med school,

449
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,843
the one thing
they keep pounding into our heads:

450
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,475
Doctors don't show emotion.

451
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:06,956
Doctors keep their distance.

452
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:09,365
Doctors don't get involved
with a patient.

453
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,279
Oh, my.

454
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,643
May l ask which one?

455
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:21,800
Ryan O'Reily.

456
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:26,158
Why him? Why are you attracted
to him specifically?

457
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,079
l don't know.

458
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,998
He's handsome.

459
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:34,122
He's got the bullshit lrish charm.

460
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,402
And breast cancer.

461
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,802
My mom had breast cancer.

462
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:49,325
My aunt, my sister.

463
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:51,717
l'm probably gonna get it too.

464
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:54,959
l know what he's going through.

465
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:58,845
That's not love, Gloria,
that's empathy.

466
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:00,725
Want my advice?

467
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:03,720
Go home to your husband,
make love to him.

468
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:06,959
Stomp these feelings for O'Reily
into the ground.

469
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:09,880
Because unless you do,
you're gonna have trouble.

470
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,767
Well, it doesn't look like
there'll be much scarring.

471
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,236
- How's the nausea?
- Gone.

472
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:26,001
- And your appetite?
- Back.

473
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,680
- Fatigue?
- Kiss me.

474
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:31,236
- No.
- Kiss me.

475
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,079
- No.
- Please? Hey.

476
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:37,477
You know what l know,
and you feel what l feel.

477
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,046
Ryan--

478
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,640
Ryan! Officer.

479
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:47,924
- Take him back to Em City.
- Fine.

480
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:55,279
Fuck.

481
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,279
Hey, girl, take a look at me

482
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:09,044
Let me dirty up your mind, yeah

483
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:13,445
l'll strip away your hard veneer

484
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:17,759
Let me see what l can find

485
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:25,841
You're peeing.

486
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:29,477
- l'm trying.
- l have to pee.

487
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:33,675
You're serious about escaping from Oz
by digging a hole?

488
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:35,883
That's why they call me the Mole.

489
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:40,518
l once dug my way into a bank vault
with walls 20 feet into the ground.

490
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,598
And your offer
to let me follow you out?

491
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:46,521
- When l go, l won't be looking back.
- l see.

492
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:49,121
lf two people dig, it'll go faster, right?

493
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,755
- Sure.
- l used to be an architect.

494
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:54,316
l know about structures.

495
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:55,556
Let me help.

496
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:22,038
Hello, William.

497
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:25,002
Sorry about the restraints.

498
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:27,720
Peter. Peter Marie.

499
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:33,884
- Peter. Peter Marie.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

500
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:37,960
l thought l'd come by
so we could talk.

501
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,605
Broom.

502
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:47,397
Broom.
Yeah, you said that last time to me.

503
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,405
Sick.

504
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:56,919
You said that too.
What does it mean?

505
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,442
Sick and broom.

506
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,764
What are you trying to tell me?

507
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:13,367
Sick, broom, amour.

508
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,846
- Sick--
- No! No!

509
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,077
- lt's okay.
- No! No!

510
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:18,475
- lt's all right.
- No!

511
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:19,762
- No! No!
- lt's okay, it's okay.

512
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,680
Calm down, calm down.
lt's okay. William.

513
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:26,639
lt's all right, William. Calm down.

514
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:28,479
Okay.

515
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:32,644
We'll just take it as slowly
as you want, okay?

516
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:36,800
We have all the time
that you need, okay?

517
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:48,800
Street.

518
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,844
Street?

519
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,040
Street.

520
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:56,324
Avenue?

521
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,318
Street.

522
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:03,365
Okay.

523
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,958
Street.

524
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:07,721
l can't do that.

525
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,196
l don't see why we can't
start these meetings with a prayer.

526
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,085
- Come on, man.
- Guys.

527
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,801
- Said, don't you agree?
- A prayer in itself is meaningless

528
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,037
unless those who offer it
do so from true belief.

529
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:20,119
Oh, man, enough of this shit.
Can we just talk about sex?

530
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,517
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We wanna bring back conjugals.

531
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:25,440
Yeah, l'm working on it, fellas.
We're a long ways away.

532
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:28,758
- Next.
- Yeah, l got a grievance.

533
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:29,996
Go ahead.

534
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,397
- Certain guys stink.
- Oh, Adebisi.

535
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,797
l know some people come
from far-away places

536
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:36,878
where they don't bathe,
but in America,

537
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:40,801
l think washing should be mandatory,
if only for health-code reasons.

538
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,037
Take a fucking bath once in a while.

539
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:45,004
You wanna bath me up,
eh, little Nino?

540
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,442
- Oh, shit.
- You'd like that, huh?

541
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:49,279
Soaping me up, eh?

542
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:56,720
There's your fucking bath right there.
There's your fucking bath.

543
00:37:56,887 --> 00:38:00,038
All right, l guess this meeting
is adjourned.

544
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:04,598
Adebisi, go back to your pod.
Schibetta, to my office.

545
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,156
This is why we'll never come
to your meetings again, McManus.

546
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:19,599
Miguel.

547
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:23,155
- Sit?
- l ain't staying too long.

548
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:28,843
- You and me, we got a lot in common.
- l don't think so.

549
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,397
Well, we both have Latin blood
and we both peddle tits.

550
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,956
Me, l'm strictly a street-drug guy.
Heroin, marijuana.

551
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,038
You, because you work
in the prison hospital,

552
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:39,277
you sell pharmaceuticals.

553
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:42,837
So l'm thinking we should combine.

554
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:46,363
- No, thanks.
- l'm willing to divide the pie 60-40.

555
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,279
And you know
l make a shitload more than you.

556
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,397
Why you wanna be
so generous with me, man?

557
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:55,604
l want Adebisi dead.

558
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:59,524
What, do l look like a mook to you?

559
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,762
You're offering me 60-40
and all l gotta do is kill Adebisi?

560
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:07,761
Shit.
Why don't you have him do it, huh?

561
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:10,521
Everyone knows l hate Adebisi.

562
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:12,962
He turns up dead,
no one suspects you.

563
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:15,436
That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

564
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:17,359
No, l'll tell you what you're thinking.

565
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:20,325
You're thinking, a spic kills the cocolo,
they end up at war.

566
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:25,685
No offence, no offence,
but drop fucking dead.

567
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,197
Hey, Papi, l been thinking, eh?

568
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:46,803
Yeah? That must be
a new experience for you, huh?

569
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:50,681
About me and you in business.

570
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,678
Shit. l should have read
my horoscope, you know?

571
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:55,998
Today's my lucky day.
Everybody wanna share the wealth.

572
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,476
Don't tell me, let me guess, right?

573
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:00,645
You want me to kill him, right?

574
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:05,442
You know the rules.
We don't whack Wiseguys.

575
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:08,565
Fuck the rules. Schibetta ain't Nino.

576
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:11,036
This one got no balls...

577
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:12,636
...and neither do you.

578
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,677
Yo, you gonna let him
fucking disrespect you like that, man?

579
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:25,116
Look, he and the wop are
two breaths away from going down.

580
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:29,485
Us, we're gonna pull up a lawn chair,
we gonna sit back, we gonna relax,

581
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:32,605
and we gonna watch them go.
You got me?

582
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,440
Then we'll pick up the pieces
of whatever's left over.

583
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:36,596
- All right?
- All right.

584
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,359
All right, baby.

585
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:35,758
Come on, boys.
Be all that you can be.

586
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:42,005
Now, you probably saying:

587
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,920
''Boy meets girl,
that's one boring fucking story.

588
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,315
lt's always the same.''

589
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:50,162
But there are variations
on the theme, like:

590
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:53,922
boy meets dog, boy loses dog,
boy buys new dog.

591
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:56,396
Or girl meets psychiatrist,

592
00:41:56,567 --> 00:42:00,116
girl goes to therapy
for the next ten years.

593
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:03,081
Or in Oz, there's always...

594
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:07,444
...boy meets boy.

595
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:03,356
Prisoner number 98K51 4,
Christopher Keller.

596
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:06,758
Convicted June 1 6th, '98.

597
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:10,966

598
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,846

00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:19,206
Sentence, 88 years.
Up for parole in 50.

600
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:25,680
Hill, gather your stuff.

601
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:28,202
- You're moving to another pod.
- What? Why?

602
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:29,846
McManus wants
to keep mixing things up.

603
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,077
Doesn't want roommates
getting attached to each other.

604
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,158
- Who's moving in here?
- New guy.

605
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:47,481
Chris Keller, Tobias Beecher.

606
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:50,445
He'll be your sponsor in Emerald City.
He's gonna show you the ropes.

607
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,159
So you a fag?

608
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:04,765
No. You?

609
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,043
l do what l have to.

610
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:12,836
Rats in the garden
Catch them, Towser

611
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,642
Cow's in the cornfield
Run, boys, run

612
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:18,685
Cat's in the cream pot
Stop her now, sir

613
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:22,317
Fire on the mountain
Run, boys, run

614
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:36,806
You the new prag?

615
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:40,717
lt's gonna cost you $1 0
to use the phone.

616
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:41,956
What?

617
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:45,161
lt's gonna cost you 1 0 bucks
to get in there.

618
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:49,480
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

619
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:54,236
Broke my fucking nose.

620
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:58,802
Whoa, what's going on?
What's going on?

621
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,682
Hey, better get to the ER.

622
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:09,925
l owe you.

623
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:13,841
l didn't do it for you, pal.
l hate those Aryan fucks.

624
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:21,283
Come in, Beecher. Sit down.

625
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:26,238
The other day, before Hill's hearing,
l met Judge Grace Lema.

626
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:30,400
- Oh, really? How is the cunt?
- She asked about you.

627
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,762
The cunt put me in here.

628
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:35,122
The cunt gave me
the toughest sentence possible.

629
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:37,403
She asked if she could
come and see you.

630
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:39,883
What a cunt.

631
00:45:41,767 --> 00:45:44,361
You know, my trial lasted 28 days.

632
00:45:44,527 --> 00:45:48,725
And every single one of those days,

633
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:51,481
l had to stare up at that cunt's face

634
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:58,166
while she banged her cunt gavel
and instructed the jury to fuck me over.

635
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,397
l didn't have a choice.

636
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,956
l had to see the cunt.

637
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:08,244
- Now l don't have to.
- Yes, you do.

638
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:10,718
You gonna force me?

639
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,005
Yes.

640
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:14,882
Why?

641
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:18,842
Because l think it'll be therapeutic.
Ultimately, you'll thank me.

642
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:22,799
You know what?

643
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:25,641
You're a cunt too.

644
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:34,805
Mr. Beecher, l appreciate
your taking the time to see me.

645
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:38,004
Well, you know, it's a nice break
from getting fucked up the ass.

646
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,725
- Beecher.
- lt's all right.

647
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:42,037
You can speak freely.

648
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:47,525
l'm afraid, in court,
you never had that chance.

649
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:49,598
Would it have made a difference?

650
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,246
No.

651
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:52,999
Lady,

652
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:54,879
what do you want?

653
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:58,483
l've been a judge for 1 6 years.

654
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:03,199
l've made over 2500 decisions.
Most of them were good.

655
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,284
But only one
has haunted me. Yours.

656
00:47:08,847 --> 00:47:12,283
You see, l've always prided myself
on being fair.

657
00:47:12,447 --> 00:47:16,725
That in my court,
justice was truly blind.

658
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,556
But in your case,

659
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:27,363
that little girl,

660
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:30,796
her parents crying,

661
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:34,479
you being a member of the bar,

662
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:38,438
your prior arrest for DUl,

663
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:42,525
the senselessness of it all,

664
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,482
it caught up with me.

665
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:52,438
l was quick-tempered and spiteful
to the point where...

666
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:59,037
...l can't tell if l gave you a fair trial.

667
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:03,198
Now seeing you like this, l--

668
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:07,163
l think maybe the punishment
exceeded the crime.

669
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,237
And l'm...

670
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:16,396
Well...

671
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:25,319
You're what? Sorry?

672
00:48:27,847 --> 00:48:31,476
Your Honour, you used all your power
to crush me.

673
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:36,358
But the truth is,

674
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:39,164
l did kill Cathy Rockwell.

675
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:43,525
And as much as l tried to manipulate
the legal system to get off,

676
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:48,078
to get out of it, l took her life.

677
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,520
According to the law, each crime
is worth a certain number of years.

678
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:58,477
You gave me a maximum
of 1 5 years in this fuckhole!

679
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:02,476
ls that too much? Too harsh?
Not enough? l don't know.

680
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:06,477
You say you're haunted
by what you did? Well, so am l.

681
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:13,320
And if you came here
for me to forgive you...

682
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:18,077
...you've come to the wrong man.

683
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:22,445
He ceased to exist
the day Cathy Rockwell did.

684
00:49:24,207 --> 00:49:26,767
And you're not gonna get
any more peace out of him

685
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:28,883
than l do out of her.

686
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:38,201
Yeah, this was very therapeutic.
Thanks.

687
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:52,558
l'm sorry.

688
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,919
Mr. Beecher?

689
00:50:08,327 --> 00:50:09,316
No.

690
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:11,479
No.

691
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:13,680
No!

692
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:16,077
- Hey. Hey. Hey, you--?
- Don't touch me.

693
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,646
- l was just wondering what happ--
- Keep your fucking hands off me,

694
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:23,718
you fucking faggot!

695
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:27,920
All right.

696
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,125
All right.

697
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:57,241
- Hey.
- How's it going?

698
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,126
Showering with this baby on
is a bitch.

699
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,485
About last night,
calling you a faggot, l--

700
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:11,957
Forget about it.
l've had my share of nightmares.

701
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:17,602
Look, when you helped me out the
other day by the phones, l told you...

702
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:19,596
...l owe you.

703
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:24,605
See, the way l figure it, you and me,
we're not like the rest of them.

704
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:27,281
The Latinos, the Homeboys,
the Aryans,

705
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:28,562
see, they all got each other.

706
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:30,206
You and me...

707
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:35,839
You and me are standing out there
with our dicks swinging in the wind.

708
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,761
We should be able
to rely on each other.

709
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:42,120
You know?

710
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:43,801
Trust each other.

711
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,327
Well, it's hard for me
to trust somebody.

712
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:49,364
Me too.

713
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:54,162
But we got
a long fucking time together, so...

714
00:51:57,847 --> 00:51:59,644
...why don't we see what happens,
all right?

715
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:04,286
All right?

716
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:09,280
All right.

717
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,925
Good.

718
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,956
- There you are, you cocksucker.
- Hey, hey, calm down, Mark.

719
00:52:26,127 --> 00:52:28,197
He broke my nose.
You broke my motherfucking nose!

720
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,483
Hey. Hey, give it your best shot.

721
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,003
All right, back off.
We're okay here, officer.

722
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:36,323
Come on, go work it off.

723
00:52:39,887 --> 00:52:42,162
So how goes Operation Toby?

724
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,477
lt'll take some time.

725
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:46,923
But don't worry, sooner or later,
Beecher will be mine.

726
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:59,443
Boy meets girl, boy gets laid.

727
00:52:59,607 --> 00:53:01,438
What makes us
wanna fuck somebody?

728
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:11,756
ls it the colour of their eyes,
the shape of their legs,

729
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:14,361
the spike of their heels?

730
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,882
Or is it what the poets tell us?

731
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:21,040
That there's something deeper,
a shared loss.

732
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:25,723
A longing to find someone
who knows the depth of our sadness.

733
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:29,845
Some people search their whole lives
for that someone.

734
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,760
Some find them, some don't.

735
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:36,882
Some fool themselves
into believing they're in love.

736
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,596
And in Oz, most times,

737
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:43,964
the illusion is better than reality.
