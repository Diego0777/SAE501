1
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:41,640
Ah, competition brings out
the best in people.

2
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,649
That's what they say.

3
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,844
When the game is on the line,
a true sportsman

4
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,979
wants the outcome
to rest on his shoulders.

5
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:50,455
The logic being:
you make the winning play,

6
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,583
you walk away a hero.

7
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:55,493
Of course, if you fuck up,
you're the goat.

8
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:58,191
The problem
with competition here in Oz

9
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:03,100
is we mostly got goats.

10
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,105
Please welcome a new
contestant, Joanie Kennedy.

11
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,834
And you are going
to be helped by a man

12
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:10,035
who's done just about everything,
Bill Boggs.

13
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,169
- How are you, Bill?
- Good to see you, Gordon.

14
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:15,579
Okay, let's play the game. The category
is sports. The question is this:

15
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:20,177
ln basketball, Joanie, what does it mean
when a referee makes this motion?

16
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,155
He wants to do the hustle?

17
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,519
Sorry, l don't
follow basketball.

18
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:31,395
l'm more into
deep-sea fishing.

19
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,695
Okay, an assist
from you then, Bill.

20
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,429
When the referee does that,
it's also known as ''walking.''

21
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,471
How you feeling there, Omar?

22
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,572
- l'm feeling pretty good.
- Really?

23
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,776
l still feel all kinds
of aches and pains

24
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:52,148
from when you stabbed me.

25
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,710
Well, you know,
l'm sorry about that.

26
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,689
- Oh, you're sorry?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,450
l'm sorry
you didn't die.

28
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,597
No, no, no!

29
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:19,676
Prisoner number 96G522,

30
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,773
Carmen Guerra,
aka ''Chico'';

31
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:27,719
Convicted June 4th, 1996;
murder in the first degree.

32
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:30,120
Sentence: 53 years,

33
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,590
up for parole in 17.

34
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,856
- McManus, l got to talk to you, man.
- Later.

35
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:38,092
lt's about your pet project,
Omar White.

36
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:41,259
- What about him?
- He's still a tit man.

37
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:44,793
And you feel compelled to tell me this
out of some need to save his soul?

38
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:47,272
Look, he shanked you
and he shanked me,

39
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:50,003
and it's only a matter of time before
he shanks someone else.

40
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,910
You shake him down,
you'll find drugs.

41
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:57,007
Shakedown!

42
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:00,118
Hey!

43
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:07,916
- Lookie, lookie.
- Look at my shit.

44
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,831
Double play.

45
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,505
- You yellow rat motherfucking punk!
- Fuck you, man.

46
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:29,708
- You bastard!
- Put Mr. Guerra in the cage.

47
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,877
- Take Mr. White upstairs.
- Fucking yellow rat bastard punk!

48
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,285
Pussy!

49
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,589
We had an agreement.

50
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,959
- No drugs.
- l know.

51
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:46,693
So tell me why l shouldn't FedEx
your ass back to solitary.

52
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,564
There is no reason.

53
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,365
lt's that when it come--

54
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:54,134
comes to tits, l'm just
a little shaky, man.

55
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,803
l mean,
God knows l try.

56
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,971
l try.

57
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:02,243
But the temptation--

58
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,541
it just grows and grows

59
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,247
until l can't help it.
l just--

60
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,018
l just got to shove that shit
where it don't belong.

61
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,822
You really think
l'm a bubblehead, don't you?

62
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,299
Sir?

63
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,325
You make
that sorrowful face,

64
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,533
you say what you think l want to hear.
You're full of shit, Omar!

65
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:30,302
And you can try my
patience only so far.

66
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,835
Now Sister Pete says you've been
inconsistent about going to rehab.

67
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,974
- Nuh-uh.
- There is a session at 1 :00 today.

68
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,917
Fucking be there.

69
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,318
Let's go.

70
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,921
The key-- the key
is to fill the time

71
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,228
you would use doing drugs
with something else.

72
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:57,066
Like busting McManus' ass
in basketball. Okay.

73
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:00,129
Well, activities
are good, but l mean,

74
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:02,471
that doesn't change
one basic fact, you know.

75
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,739
You're not going to quit
unless you want to quit.

76
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:08,737
You know, you have to hit rock bottom
before you can crawl out.

77
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,773
Why you looking at me
when you say that?

78
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,479
l wasn't saying it to you.
l was saying it to the group.

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,650
What? You-- you think
you're better than me

80
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,626
- because you-- you quit and l can't?
- Omar.

81
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,686
You ain't better than me,
you fucking punk-ass white boy!

82
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,960
lnstead of snorting,
you've been sucking cock!

83
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,958
- That's enough, Omar!
- You want to suck this, motherfucker?

84
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:36,401
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

85
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,005
- You got nothing!
- You think l'm fucking here?

86
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,489
You got no game, Vahue.

87
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,822
What you gonna do, come over
and scratch me again?

88
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,294
l got you.
l got you, Chapman.

89
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,264
- You piece of shit.
- Poet's the greatest of all time!

90
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,426
Take care.

91
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,204
As a rule, l don't
give up on people,

92
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,800
but this guy, Omar,
may be the exception.

93
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,868
White!

94
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:23,445
l know.
l fucked up again.

95
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,721
- Mm-hmm.
- All the bullshit aside,

96
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:33,061
l want-- l want
to own my own mind.

97
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,930
Look,

98
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,495
l don't know why
l think l can help you,

99
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:43,103
but l'm not giving
up on you, Omar.

100
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,805
You understand?
l'm not giving up.

101
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:49,004
Thank you.

102
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,483
You fucking bastard!

103
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:04,156
l hope you die in here,
you motherfucking bastard!

104
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,529
l hope you rot in hell!

105
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:10,195
You killed my baby!

106
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,540
The parole board
has set the hearing for next Wednesday.

107
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,873
lf all goes
according to Hoyle,

108
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,744
Tobias, you could be
out of Oz by the end of the month.

109
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,874
Have Cathy Rockwell's parents been
made aware of the hearing?

110
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:27,182
Probably not.
ln most cases, it's the responsibility

111
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,916
of the victim or the victim's family
to stay informed.

112
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,356
Well, l want you
to tell them.

113
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:36,055
That's not advisable. lf they ask
to testify, Cathy's parents could

114
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,892
sway the board away
from paroling you.

115
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,058
Until my son was killed,
l never fully understood

116
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,691
what l'd done
to those two people.

117
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:46,031
l can't go back into the world knowing
that l snuck out.

118
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,870
The Rockwells are as much a part
of my prison term as anyone.

119
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,569
They have a right
to be heard.

120
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,271
Okay, l'll
phone them.

121
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:55,076
But first,
before the parole hearing,

122
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:57,605
l'm going to ask them to have
an interaction with you.

123
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,142
Catherine.

124
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:03,314
l hope you understand
why l'm doing this.

125
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,052
As a lawyer, l think
you're insane.

126
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,754
But as a mother...

127
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,458
l think you've got
balls for days.

128
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:25,239
Last time we saw each other,
Mrs. Rockwell,

129
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,269
l didn't say much.

130
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,214
- You didn't say anything.
- Yeah.

131
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,546
Well, that's because
l was on drugs

132
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,611
and l was confused,

133
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,589
full of self-loathing.

134
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,751
And now you've
forgiven yourself?

135
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,521
No.

136
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,428
What l did to your daughter
will shadow me forever,

137
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,058
just as being
in Oz will.

138
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,534
What's happened
to me in here--

139
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:58,067
well, whether l've suffered
enough to satisfy you

140
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,477
l don't know.

141
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:04,074
When you were sentenced
to 15 years,

142
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:06,085
l was stunned.

143
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:11,523
15 lousy years doesn't
equal the lifetime my daughter lost.

144
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,988
You say
you've suffered,

145
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,963
and l say
l'm glad.

146
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:25,295
When the lawyer came to talk
about my being paroled,

147
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:27,863
she said that because
of extenuating circumstances,

148
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:32,674
the board might
look kindly on me.

149
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:40,114
Why don't you explain
the circumstances?

150
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:45,147
Since l've
been inside,

151
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,625
my son
was murdered

152
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,924
and my wife
may have been,

153
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,524
both as a result
of things l did in here.

154
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:59,193
lt's ironic
that l came to Oz

155
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,206
walking across the grave
of your daughter

156
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,607
and l may leave
walking across

157
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,238
the graves
of my own family.

158
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:14,713
lf they had lived, l wouldn't have
the chance of going free.

159
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,949
When l saw you
four years ago,

160
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:22,087
the pain of Cathy's death
was still so new.

161
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,289
Dave and l...

162
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,599
grieved and grieved
and grieved.

163
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,602
We still do.

164
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:34,003
But the sorrow
is balanced with joy.

165
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,407
We have another child, Richard, and he's
growing up to be remarkable.

166
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:44,441
We've come to believe
that even though

167
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:48,784
we don't understand
why Cathy's gone

168
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,319
we accept her death
as part of some...

169
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,793
wise plan.

170
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:59,956
l don't know
if you've suffered enough.

171
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,593
That's not up to me
to decide.

172
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:04,364
Only God can.

173
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:14,072
We will not interfere
with your parole.

174
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,323
Vince Lombardi
once said

175
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:27,121
that winning isn't everything,
it's the only thing.

176
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,628
But the one thing Lombardi
held in higher regard

177
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,028
than winning
was character.

178
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,590
ln fact, without character,
there'd be no victory.

179
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,295
Now, don't get
me wrong.

180
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,771
Some of his players would
miss curfew, cat around, get jiggy,

181
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,865
but they always knew
where to draw the line.

182
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,466
That's right.

183
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,411
A good man knows
where to draw the line.

184
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:56,747
Robson, you are
one ugly motherfucker.

185
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:00,190
l don't see you
modeling in Milan, you black bitch.

186
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,093
Hey, shut the fuck up.
l'm trying to masturbate.

187
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,189
- Fuck you, Alvarez!
- Quiet!

188
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,962
- Warden's on deck.
- Yo.

189
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,765
Yo, Glynn. Yo, l need an appointment,
motherfucker.

190
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:13,863
Hey, Glynn,
you get me excited.

191
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,373
Why don't you
hold my dick?

192
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:17,672
We need
to talk alone.

193
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,076
- Did you frisk him?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:21,978
Okay.

195
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:25,180
You actually think
l'd shank you?

196
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,846
l have no idea what
you're capable of anymore.

197
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,479
l'm stunned.

198
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:32,616
l mean, here you are, a man feared
by all the prisoners in Oz,

199
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,957
- afraid of me. Wow.
- What do you want?

200
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,395
l've decided to confess
to the murder of John Basil,

201
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,558
and l intend to ask
for the death penalty.

202
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,228
So that you can die
a martyr.

203
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,794
l've written
a manifesto

204
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:49,001
l want published
the day l'm executed.

205
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,033
Where'd you get the paper?
Officer Smith!

206
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,973
Under no circumstances
is this prisoner to be allowed paper.

207
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,814
- Leo!
- You want to destroy yourself, fine.

208
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,184
But l'm not going to
make it easy for you.

209
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,745
Goddamn motherfucker!

210
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,831
Oh, don't go away,
Uncle Tom.

211
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't go away.
Don't leave me like this, baby.

212
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:21,138
- Don't leave me like this.
- Warden!

213
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:24,575
Carl Jenkins is dead.
You've no case against me.

214
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,770
l want
out of here, Glynn.

215
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,475
l want out of here, Glynn!
l want out!

216
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:34,179
l want a fucking lawyer!
Get me fucking Said!

217
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,678
You motherfucker!
Get me out of here!

218
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,583
l don't want to release
Robson from solitary

219
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,595
anymore than you do,
but l got no choice.

220
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,256
Carl Jenkins
committed suicide.

221
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,426
A good defense attorney could shoot
holes through his testimony.

222
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,197
And without his testimony we got
no case against Robson.

223
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,296
So you're going to put him
back in the Gen Pop

224
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,069
even though he masterminded
the death of Salah Yudin

225
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,406
and he has vowed
to kill me, too?

226
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,470
l'm afraid so.
Since we can't prove Robson's guilt,

227
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:04,415
keeping him in solitary
would be unjust.

228
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,611
Now, why is it
that justice

229
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,984
only works in somebody
else's favor?

230
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,233
Arif, help me.

231
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,792
l have such rage
inside of me.

232
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,634
Rage unlike
l've ever known.

233
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,470
You've always been able
to control such emotions.

234
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:33,342
l don't think
l can do that much longer.

235
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:36,473
- l feel like l'm possessed.
- Pray to Allah.

236
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:38,380
Pray?

237
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:43,377
l pray and l pray
and nothing.

238
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:48,516
Yo, sorry about what happened
to Leroy Tidd,

239
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:52,190
or Ooga Booga or whatever
the fuck you call him.

240
00:15:56,469 --> 00:16:00,200
- You fucking nigger!
- You want to see the nigger in me?

241
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,707
You want to see
the nigger in me?

242
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,661
Fucking spade.
Motherfucker.

243
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,827
Fucking cock--
motherfucker.

244
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:33,305
- Fucking nigger!
- The Aryans must be punished.

245
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,864
We will no longer
tolerate their actions.

246
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:38,502
From this moment on,
we are all on point.

247
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,944
Said's nigger ass
is in the hole.

248
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,448
- Looks like Arif's in charge.
- All right.

249
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,541
These fuckers are
more pissed off than ever.

250
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,609
l want you guys to watch
each other's back,

251
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,213
- carry weapons whenever you can.
- lt's payback time.

252
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,986
This shit's gonna
go down real soon.

253
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,391
What the fuck
is this all about?

254
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:58,158
Father Mukada
loaned me his office.

255
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,358
The warden wants me
to speak with you.

256
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,163
He fears that there
will be an escalation of hostilities

257
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:04,931
between your people
and the Muslims.

258
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,938
Sit down,
please.

259
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,304
The hacks have good reason
to fear, Preacher.

260
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,139
So do you.

261
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,702
You feel that l have
wronged you

262
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,510
by getting Carl Jenkins
to testify against Robson,

263
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,508
but l assure you what l did,
l did in the name of justice.

264
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:23,078
No, what you did you did
because Robson got pissed

265
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,386
when you tried to turn me
into a psalm singer.

266
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:28,222
Oh, l never imagined
that you would convert.

267
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,286
l simply wanted you
to know a little joy in your life,

268
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,764
the birth
of your grandchild.

269
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,601
Yeah, if she is
my grandchild.

270
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:42,507
You ever talk to that woman
in your congregation?

271
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,372
Sarah? Yes.

272
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,776
She and Carrie have had
numerous conversations,

273
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:50,213
and at no time did Carrie say anything
about having been a prostitute.

274
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,046
Sarah ask her directly?

275
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,574
No.

276
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,985
Well, then you've proved
nothing either way.

277
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,353
When are you going to
see this girl again?

278
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,154
ln an hour.

279
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,855
Unless the warden puts
the entire prison in lockdown.

280
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:08,333
lf l could assure him that
at least for the time being

281
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:11,598
there will be
no immediate trouble,

282
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:14,504
maybe Warden Glynn
will reconsider.

283
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,804
You've got
yourself a deal.

284
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,680
Hi, Mr. Schillinger.

285
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,687
Ooh, what happened
to your face?

286
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:30,450
Oh, nothing.
lt's fine.

287
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,593
There we are,
all nice and dry.

288
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:39,757
Hey, you ready to play
with Grandpa? Huh?

289
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,565
- That's okay.
- Something wrong?

290
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,093
l'm gonna ask you
some serious questions,

291
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:48,265
and l want you
to talk true.

292
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:52,902
- Okay.
- Put the baby down.

293
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,039
lt's okay.

294
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,242
lt's okay, Jewel.

295
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:02,152
- Oh, sweetie.
- lt's come to my attention

296
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,349
that you worked
the streets, hooking.

297
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,692
l can see it's true.

298
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:12,094
- Hank said we needed money.
- l don't want to hear that part.

299
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:15,328
What's important is
who's child is that?

300
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:20,798
She's not Hank's, is she? You knew that
the day you showed up here!

301
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,934
Mr. Schillinger, l swear when the doctor
told me l was pregnant,

302
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:28,436
l counted backwards trying to figure
out who the father was.

303
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,109
On the day the baby
was conceived,

304
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:36,417
l had sex with three
different men, okay?

305
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,913
Two out-of-town salesmen
and Hank.

306
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,088
So the truth is l don't know
which one was the father.

307
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,996
l'm not sure...

308
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,938
except--
stare at her face.

309
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,100
Don't she look
like Hank?

310
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,871
Don't she?

311
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,517
lt's okay.

312
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:22,497
Okay, Cloutier's gotten Schillinger
to agree not to retaliate,

313
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:24,594
so he's gonna keep
his boy Robson in check.

314
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:27,197
l need your assurance
that the Muslims will cooperate.

315
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,834
- No.
- No? No what? You won't cooperate?

316
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,344
No, l can't assure
you of anything, McManus,

317
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:38,783
least of all the good behavior
of my people or myself.

318
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,650
Because, you see,
what's been going on has been going on

319
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:46,124
and will go on till long after you, me
and Schillinger are all dead.

320
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,093
- My only concern is right now.
- Well, that's not surprising

321
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,153
because you always did
take the short view.

322
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,630
Well, maybe you need another
couple of days in here.

323
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,362
- Yeah, maybe l do!
- Up to you.

324
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:59,200
Go ahead, get out!

325
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:07,043
lf athletes learned to control
their tempers, to control their rage,

326
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,344
then hockey players wouldn't
do time in the penalty box,

327
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,942
basketball players wouldn't
draw technical fouls,

328
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:16,182
football players wouldn't
be penalized 15 yards.

329
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:19,486
Of course, if athletes
did control their rage,

330
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,426
nobody would be
interested in sports.

331
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:25,487
The punching, choking,
kicking, biting, screaming--

332
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,795
that's what the fans
go to see.

333
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,311
Oh, shit.

334
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,310
What are you doing?

335
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,751
lt's 7:00 a.m. Game two's
not till this afternoon.

336
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,118
Yeah. l wanted
to work on my shot.

337
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:53,215
l'm still haunted by those fucking air
balls l threw up last game.

338
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:56,386
Don't beat yourself up. l mean,
l couldn't get much going, either.

339
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,555
Yeah.

340
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,656
What do you think
of Vahue?

341
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,929
The guy's a stone bitch.

342
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,766
A strong, tough,
talented player.

343
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,568
That's funny. That's what
l said about you.

344
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:12,373
- Huh?
- Well, maybe not in those exact words.

345
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,476
A friend of mine is a scout
with the Sacramento Kings.

346
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:20,383
l told him about you.
He says he wants to take a look.

347
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,515
- A look?
- Yeah, today.

348
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,398
Hey, yo, you got
two dunks off the bat,

349
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:37,766
l was like, ''Oh shit,
the fat lady's singing.''

350
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:42,963
Hey, yo, man, seconds.

351
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:46,808
- And... special stash.
- Oh, shit.

352
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:49,313
All right?

353
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,646
Hey, yo, man,
this guy Brass, man,

354
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:53,743
- he's some fucking talent, huh?
- Yeah.

355
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:56,311
- Oh, fuck that.
- Uh-uh, that motherfucker can play.

356
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:58,653
- l'm too big for him, though.
- Yeah, yeah.

357
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,682
You know game two
gonna go like game one.

358
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:02,956
lt'll stay close...

359
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:04,690
as long as l let it.

360
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,228
- Are you hearing this?
- Yeah, it's true.

361
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,036
Vahue's a wide body.
There's no way to guard him.

362
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:18,703
There's no way for McManus
and Brass to win.

363
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:25,606
Hey, Vahue.

364
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,482
Go back
and get your tray.

365
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,715
- Oh, l got that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

366
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:32,553
He busses his own tray.

367
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,194
Yo, fuck that.

368
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,624
- Oh, shit!
- Back the fuck up!

369
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,533
Back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

370
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:48,165
- What the fuck is that? Come on, man?
- Damn! You broke my knee.

371
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,334
Well, say something.

372
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,842
Vahue brought the situation
on himself.

373
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,868
We were
by the book, McManus.

374
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,949
All right, let me know
if it's too tight.

375
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,951
- ls it my ACL?
- No, your ACL is fine.

376
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:03,284
lt's just your knee's badly swollen.
You should stay off it a few days.

377
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,085
We'll push the game
back a week.

378
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:07,490
- Oh, because you care about me, right?
- No.

379
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:10,723
- l just want your best game.
- Oh, you still think you're gonna win?

380
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,960
Like l said, the ball bounces
the right way, who knows?

381
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:19,693
You're telling me
l ain't got any damage?

382
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,433
None that l can see.

383
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,941
Then l'm going to
see you in the gym then.

384
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,604
Tell your boy
bring his A game, too.

385
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,893
?? People always talkin'
what they gonna do ??

386
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,901
?? They must want their face
to maybe taste my shoe ??

387
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:53,166
?? l can't understand
all the push and shove ??

388
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:56,333
?? And what the -- happened
to the peace and love? ??

389
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,401
?? Who planted that glove?
Man, l don't care ??

390
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:02,470
?? l'm too busy running fingers
through your momma's hair ??

391
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:05,972
?? l got no time
for the fakes and phonies ??

392
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:09,146
?? The crooks, the creeps,
the cops and the cronies ??

393
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:12,214
?? Am l the only one
on my side? ??

394
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:15,351
?? Test my pride,
l bet you run and hide ??

395
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:18,090
?? You think l'm weak,
so you're looking for the kill ??

396
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,963
?? But there's 16 shots
in my nine mil ??

397
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:25,368
?? l got one for you,
this is your shot... ??

398
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:26,769
Yeah!

399
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:30,901
?? l got one for you,
this is your shot ??

400
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,776
?? Jimmy Jimmy,
Ji-- ah, Jimmy, Jimmy ??

401
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,804
?? Don't want to hear me cuss,
don't want to hear me brag ??

402
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,750
?? So l'm grabbin' on my thingy
while l let my pants sag ??

403
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,948
?? Never think what l've written,
just write what l'm doin' ??

404
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:45,889
?? They say they like my records,
but they still boo-hooing ??

405
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:49,382
?? My jeans always tight,
my rhymes will floor you ??

406
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,726
?? Hey slime, you want
to hit money? ??

407
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:56,632
?? l got one for you,
this is your shot... ??

408
00:25:56,668 --> 00:26:00,468
?? l got one for you ??

409
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:03,474
- ?? This is your shot ??
- Bullshit!

410
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:15,585
?? l like that. ??

411
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,285
Hey, Vahue.

412
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,020
Yeah, not.

413
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,187
You fucking
let us down, Vahue.

414
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:27,562
l had a lot of money bet
on that game, cocksucker.

415
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,163
Tug, let me
get the chair.

416
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:34,195
No, man, l'm using it.

417
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,934
No, for real, dude.
l need to sit down

418
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:38,033
and elevate this leg, man.
Come on.

419
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:52,114
- Yo, l'm out, babe.
- l'm with you.

420
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,751
Hey, yo, Poet.
Hey, man, at dinner,

421
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:56,784
how about l get some
more of that Gatorade?

422
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:58,625
l don't know, Jackson.
l don't know.

423
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,098
l'm dehydrated, man.
l lost a lot of water today.

424
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:04,762
l'll see what l can do,
but it's a tall order.

425
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,345
Look, it's simple.

426
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:22,012
ln three weeks, l want you to come out
to our rookie camp.

427
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:24,215
- Oh, Jesus.
- No guarantees,

428
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:28,158
- but l think you can make our club.
- Congratulations.

429
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:31,094
l got to go. Somebody from player
personnel will contact you.

430
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,360
And one last thing. l don't want to tell
you not to play pick-up games,

431
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,162
this thing you
and Tim got going,

432
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:38,294
but use your head.
All right?

433
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:40,134
All right.
Stay strong.

434
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:50,774
- l'll still play.
- l can't ask you to do that.

435
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,580
- l know you want to win that last game.
- l'll find someone else.

436
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:55,745
- Tim--
- l'll find someone.

437
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,663
Fuck.

438
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:14,536
There he goes now,
the luckiest man on the planet.

439
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:18,669
- Lucky?
- Correction: formerly lucky.

440
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,701
The word's out,
McManus.

441
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:23,681
That scout today came
to scoop up your boy.

442
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,047
- He's on his way to the Kings.
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:29,053
And without Brass, you're gonna look
pretty fucking foolish.

444
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:33,251
l bet you'd lose
by... 50, 60 points.

445
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,759
Well, who says
l'm without him?

446
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,066
l thought Dave Brass
wasn't playing.

447
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:47,264
- He's not.
- So what was that all about?

448
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:49,466
l couldn't stomach giving
Morales the satisfaction.

449
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,499
He'll get it soon enough.

450
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,979
- Hey, Martinez. Hey.
- Hola, mi hermano.

451
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:03,544
- Warden still got you over in Unit B?
- Yeah.

452
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:07,024
- Excellent. l need an ask.
- Ask.

453
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,818
Easy, easy, easy!

454
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:39,051
Stay down! All right, all right!
Easy, easy! God damn it!

455
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:46,628
- Where's Brass?
- The ambulance just left.

456
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:49,691
- He needed surgery.
- Oh, fuck! How bad was he?

457
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:51,827
On the big scale of things,
he's going to be just fine.

458
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,861
- But?
- But Dave's done with basketball.

459
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,873
His Achilles tendon
wasn't just severed,

460
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,670
a chunk of it
was missing.

461
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,405
He'll be walking funny
the rest of his life.

462
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:18,763
What you want?

463
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,526
How does it feel?

464
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,465
How does what feel?

465
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:26,164
Being the one
who snitched to the hacks,

466
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,468
who kept us
from greasing Morales,

467
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,771
Pancamo
and the rest,

468
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:33,039
who kept us from taking
over the drug trade?

469
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:37,613
No, no, no, no. Come here,
come here, come here.

470
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:39,116
Listen...

471
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,675
Burr Redding
says you get to live

472
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,778
because you and he
got history.

473
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,120
But he ain't going
to be around forever, bro'.

474
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:49,389
And when he die...
you die.

475
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:53,056
- Let the man go, son.
- Oh, you want something?

476
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:55,532
- What's up, nigger?
- You know, as much as l'd like to watch

477
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:59,230
the two of you whack each other,
the smart thing to do is walk away.

478
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,133
- Yeah. Later.
- You know it.

479
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,413
This is all
l'm saying, Augustus.

480
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,645
You ain't got
no friends except me.

481
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,435
The plan's working?

482
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:40,637
Yeah.

483
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,170
Morales and Pancamo
think l'm their slave.

484
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:45,683
Burr Redding thinks
l'm his most loyal soldier.

485
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:49,484
When we're done,
they'll all be dead.

486
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:54,219
and we'll be
running things our way.

487
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,056
l have
to admit, Tug,

488
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:58,995
l was kind of surprised
when you tapped my shoulder,

489
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,624
me being the one who greased
your brother and all.

490
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:05,664
When l shanked you
and you didn't die,

491
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,695
l knew you
had balls.

492
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:12,310
lt doesn't take
a genius

493
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,710
to figure out
that Tug Daniels is a traitor.

494
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,647
l always had
my suspicions.

495
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,809
What are you gonna do
about him?

496
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:23,343
Well, l believe that every man deserves
a fair trial...

497
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,517
before he's
executed.

498
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,863
This court is
now in session.

499
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:44,841
- Fuck you!
- Tug Daniels...

500
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:47,174
you're being
accused of the three disses:

501
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,942
disloyal, dishonest,

502
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:52,142
- disrespectful.
- How do you plead?

503
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,048
Man, if y'all
going to take me out,

504
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,882
just fucking
take me out, man.

505
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,444
Stop the bullshit,
all right?

506
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:00,253
You've been seen fraternizing
with Supreme Allah.

507
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:03,056
Yo, l only let that fool
think l was with him, man.

508
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:06,257
Soon as l killed you,
him and Hill was dead meat.

509
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,892
The prosecution rests.

510
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,697
- You got any defense?
- Yeah, l got a defense.

511
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,432
You're killing me
for the same crime

512
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,201
you let Hill walk on.

513
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:19,005
You're getting old, Burr.
You're getting soft.

514
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:21,239
- You can't go the distance no more.
- Silence.

515
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,476
Yo, with me in charge, you motherfuckers
would be running Oz.

516
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:27,747
Pay attention to what
l'm fixing to tell you.

517
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,779
lt is the decision
of this court

518
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,257
that you have been
found guilty.

519
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,227
- Man, kill this old pussy, not me!
- Therefore...

520
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,890
l must sentence you...

521
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:00,207
...to death.

522
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:07,648
Throw his ass back there
behind the cafeteria.

523
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:10,183
Stick him
in a garbage dumpster.

524
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,889
Move it!

525
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:28,869
What the fuck?

526
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,676
Oh, shit.

527
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,481
Hey, Officer Robinson.

528
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,852
Yo, you might want to come check
this out. Ouch!

529
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:45,093
Central, this is 16.
We've got a 44 in the cafeteria.

530
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,429
Lockdown! Lockdown!

531
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,762
Tug Daniels is dead.

532
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:55,837
Move it. Move it!

533
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,672
Our days
are numbered, bro'.

534
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,235
Me and you
ain't careful,

535
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,247
we're going to end up
like Tug Daniels.

536
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:08,345
Let's go. Let's go!

537
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,457
More and more these days,
you pick up a newspaper

538
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:20,760
and some athlete's name
is in the headline.

539
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,426
Not on the sports page,

540
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,628
but for getting into trouble
with the law.

541
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,466
l'm never surprised.

542
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:28,734
The adrenaline it takes
to be a superstar

543
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,401
is the same as the rush
you feel committing a crime.

544
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,911
When the game's over,
it's hard to put a cap on that,

545
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:36,880
hard to go back
to being ordinary.

546
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,982
l am so sick of hearing
about fucking death row.

547
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,750
- Governor.
- l see you're fully recovered.

548
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:48,691
And l can see how
much that pleases you.

549
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:51,024
All right,
let's get down to business.

550
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:54,122
l've had extensive talks with
the Attorney General,

551
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:56,429
and here's how
the situation lays out.

552
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:58,436
According to the law,

553
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,439
Giles is within his rights
asking to be stoned to death.

554
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:04,442
The fucking anti-death penalty
group that's suing us

555
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,876
will probably win.
We'll appeal.

556
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:09,903
The case will eventually land
at the State Supreme Court,

557
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:12,382
where God knows what those
buttheads will decide.

558
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:13,975
You appointed
half of them.

559
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:18,312
Thanks for reminding me.
So...

560
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:20,688
instead of plodding
through all that muck,

561
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:24,422
we've decided that it's simpler if you,
Sister Peter Marie,

562
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:26,692
declare Giles
mentally incompetent.

563
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:29,325
- What?
- l'll commute his sentence to life

564
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,767
and we'll ship his ass over
to the Conley lnstitute

565
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:33,532
where he can blubber
until he dies.

566
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,062
Meanwhile, l'll have
the legislature rewrite

567
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:38,075
the capital punishment law

568
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:40,077
limiting
the prisoner's options

569
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,102
to lethal injection
and electrocution.

570
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:43,613
l won't do it.

571
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,616
l won't say that William Giles
is insane.

572
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:48,946
- Why?
- Because he's not.

573
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,477
Leo...

574
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,513
now would be
a good time for you to jump in.

575
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,686
Peter Marie, this solution would make
the problem go away.

576
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:00,357
The problem will
go away

577
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:03,333
when the death penalty
goes away.

578
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,996
Now that there's DNA,
every other week--

579
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,164
every other week--
there's another horror story

580
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:11,175
of some innocent man
almost being put to death.

581
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,336
The governor of lllinois

582
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:16,745
- has put a moratorium on--
- George Ryan is an asshole.

583
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:18,646
And if l want
to debate this issue,

584
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,708
l'll go on
''Meet the Fucking Press''!

585
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,487
You're not the only
shrink in town, Sister.

586
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:27,320
lf you won't say he's crazy,
l'll get someone who will.

587
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:41,734
Hello, William.

588
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,071
Peter.
Peter Marie.

589
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:48,635
- How you doing?
- Moses...

590
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:51,778
...dead.

591
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,511
Lonely.

592
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,179
l'll bet.

593
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,279
You know, it's lonely
out here, too.

594
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:03,518
Your life
and the lives of hundreds

595
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:07,019
of other men and women
in the hands of lawyers and politicians.

596
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,363
l feel so...

597
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,028
powerless.

598
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,300
Noisemaker.

599
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,899
Yeah, that's me.

600
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,932
Blowing horns
and banging pots,

601
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,844
and yet,
nothing has changed.

602
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,748
Us.

603
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,852
Pray.

604
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:39,964
God.

605
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:42,831
Well, we do have that,
don't we?

606
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,199
Yes, William.

607
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,099
Us.

608
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,868
Pray.

609
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:53,702
God.

610
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,549
The State Supreme Court,
in a 5-4 decision,

611
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:05,055
declared the four-year-old
capital punishment law

612
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:08,024
to be unconstitutional
based on the case of an inmate

613
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,756
at the Oswald Correctional Facility
who asked to be stoned to death.

614
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:14,424
The justices declared
such an execution

615
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:18,299
would be cruel and unusual punishment,
well outside the boundaries--

616
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,433
My support for the death
penalty is unwavering.

617
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:26,807
However, the public's reaction
to this incident

618
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,711
indicates that we should
take this opportunity

619
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:31,612
to step back.

620
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,617
We must consider
not only the means

621
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,449
by which we determine
such a sentence,

622
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,047
but the ways
in which we implement it.

623
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,887
l am therefore
putting together

624
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:43,416
a non-partisan committee...

625
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:46,726
to re-examine all aspects
of the death penalty.

626
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:02,575
Hey, Giles,
what's going on?

627
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,205
l thought you were
halfway to death.

628
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:07,012
No, alive.
Alive!

629
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,559
Alive?

630
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,298
Hey, Officer Murphy,
l'm not feeling so hot.

631
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:34,641
- What's the matter now?
- Throat's sore.

632
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,977
Jeez, you know,
you been getting sick a lot lately.

633
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:38,948
This winter weather,
it's killing me.

634
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,213
Uh-huh.

635
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:43,277
Well, l got news for you.

636
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,983
- Dr. Nathan's not in today.
- No?

637
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,014
How do you feel now?

638
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:50,220
l want to go see my brother
in protective custody.

639
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,525
What a shock.

640
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:57,967
ln my opinion, calling someone
a ''deadbeat dad'' is unfair.

641
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,664
l mean, l would have sent
the money to my kids,

642
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:03,936
but l knew that bitch would spend
my hard-earned cash

643
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:08,435
buying clothes for herself or that cocky
kike asshole she's been living with.

644
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:11,107
Ryan!

645
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:14,550
Hey, Cyril.
How you doing, brother?

646
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,678
You okay?

647
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:18,780
When-- when can
l leave here?

648
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:21,257
- When can l come back to Emerald City?
- l don't know.

649
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:24,489
Dr. Nathan promised that she'd help
us out, but she's gone,

650
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:27,225
so as soon as she gets back, we're going
to work on getting you out of here.

651
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,563
God, this place sucks, man.
l know you're lonely.

652
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,329
Not so lonely...

653
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,996
now that Henry's here.

654
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,471
Hi, my name's Stanton,

655
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:38,907
Henry Stanton.
You're Ryan, right?

656
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,934
Cyril's told me
all about you.

657
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:45,780
- What'd you say?
- Oh, nothing incriminating.

658
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,444
Well, that's good,
you know,

659
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,680
'cause l figure a guy's
in protective custody,

660
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,052
then well, he must have--
what, ratted out his friends?

661
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:54,057
No. No, some
Aryan threatened

662
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:56,059
to separate me
from my genitals,

663
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:59,153
so the warden thought a time-out
might ease the tensions.

664
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:04,265
Don't be telling nobody
our business, okay?

665
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:06,429
l don't.
Henry's nice.

666
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,700
- l like your brother.
- Hey!

667
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,707
Henry, do you mind?

668
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:13,403
l'm trying to have
a private conversation over here.

669
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:16,436
Hey, knock
yourself out!

670
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,159
Oh, Jesus.

671
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:34,027
- What do you want?
- Just because we're not fucking anymore

672
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:37,262
- doesn't mean we can't be friends.
- Yeah, right.

673
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,826
l hear they're shipping
your brother off to the loony bin.

674
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:43,307
Yeah, because of you accusing him
of attacking you without provocation.

675
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,104
l was being neighborly,
he hit me with a tray.

676
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:46,734
Neighborly?

677
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:49,712
- Yeah, right.
- Here's a deal.

678
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:52,875
l'll tell the warden
not to send Cyril away

679
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,885
if you tell Cyril

680
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,581
he should
let me fuck him.

681
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:00,181
What?

682
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:02,454
- l want to fuck your brother.
- Uh-uh. No chance.

683
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,484
l don't want you going
anywhere near my brother.

684
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:07,793
Okay, but if l don't
get anywhere near him,

685
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:09,959
you won't get
anywhere near him, either.

686
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,992
You know what, Howell?

687
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:16,931
You're one sick,
fucking bitch.

688
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:24,804
Deputy Dawg.

689
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,818
O'Reily.

690
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:29,649
lt's about time.
l'm famished.

691
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,087
Things are pretty quiet
here in J these days, huh, man?

692
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:35,115
Well, Basil dead,
Hughes in solitary,

693
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,252
it's just me
and ''Her Highness.''

694
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,990
You don't like Howell?

695
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,124
lt's like being shackled
to the Bride of Frankenstein.

696
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:46,294
Hey, Alvin,
old pal,

697
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,601
how'd you like
some extra vittles?

698
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,607
We're talking
chocolate bars,

699
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:53,109
''Newman's Own'' popcorn
for that microwave of yours?

700
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,704
- Sure.
- All you have to do is just, you know,

701
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:57,714
make sure Howell
has a little accident.

702
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,244
- Oh, l'm no killer.
- No, no, no.

703
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,219
l'm not saying kill.

704
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:06,587
l'm talking a--
a busted leg, arm.

705
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:09,559
Just something to take her out
of commission for a week or two.

706
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,123
You about done, O'Reily?

707
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:17,159
Oh, yeah.
l'm done.

708
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:46,190
Maybe l got lucky
and she's dead.

709
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:49,456
Help.

710
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,429
Help.

711
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,965
Help!

712
00:44:58,142 --> 00:45:01,009
Help!
Help!

713
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:05,709
- What's up?
- Howell broke her pelvis.

714
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,241
- Oh, sweet.
- Yeah, she'll be laid up for a while.

715
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,446
Oh, l'm just crying
invisible tears.

716
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:17,153
How's your new cellmate?

717
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:20,254
Oh, Connolly's an ass.
He says l'm not true lrish.

718
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:22,925
He tried to pull that
same last shit with me.

719
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:26,095
- Don't worry, he'll come around.
- Yeah.

720
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:29,231
Hey, Liam... check out a guy
named Henry Stanton.

721
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:32,242
- He's in protective custody with Cyril.
- No problem.

722
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:44,718
Stay down.

723
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,987
Stay down.

724
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:49,788
Hey! What the fuck
is going on here?

725
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,886
Keep away, O'Reily.
This is none of your concern.

726
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:55,365
l see two pussy Bible Belters wailing
on a fellow Catholic?

727
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:56,661
Yeah, it's my concern.

728
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,691
Hey, come on,
motherfucker.

729
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:01,170
l'm not going to swing
on you, Burns. Not yet.

730
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:03,196
l've got God
on my side.

731
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:08,876
Kirk, you meet me
in the library.

732
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:12,440
Burns, l will talk
to you later.

733
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:17,376
My apologies, sir.

734
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,123
l'm beholden to you.

735
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:38,400
First, you had
Samuel Gougeon beaten,

736
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:40,774
now Padraig Connolly,
both against my wishes.

737
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:44,110
l am doing the Lord's work
in the best way l know how.

738
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:46,946
When you came to me
and you asked to convert,

739
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:49,452
l thought you meant you wanted
to put those ways behind you,

740
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:52,285
but l can see now
that l was wrong.

741
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:55,952
You are no longer a member
of my congregation.

742
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:59,190
- What?
- l cast thee out.

743
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,391
- You can't.
- Let me go.

744
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:04,560
- Please.
- Let me go!

745
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:18,273
ln 1972, 14 Catholics
were slaughtered.

746
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:19,942
What did they do?

747
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:22,953
They committed the hideous crime
of walking down a road.

748
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,285
My mother ran out
onto the street

749
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:28,883
and grabbed the neighbor's
son out of the stampede.

750
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:30,894
The entire time...

751
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:33,795
a British soldier
was holding an L1A1 to her head,

752
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:35,992
yelling at her
to get back.

753
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,467
But she didn't...

754
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:41,198
and he fired.

755
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:43,206
Oh, shit.

756
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,401
We call that day
''Bloody Sunday.''

757
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,707
lt's visiting time.
l got to go.

758
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:51,010
- Who's coming?
- My mom.

759
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,777
You treat your
mother right, Ryan?

760
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:55,250
We've been separated
since l was a baby.

761
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:57,083
We only
just found each other.

762
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,681
But yeah,
l treat her right.

763
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,194
l know you wonder
why l left,

764
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:08,824
and each time l've come to visit you,
l've wanted to tell you the whole story.

765
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:12,063
Hey, tell me now.

766
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:15,401
The '60s were
a mixed-up time.

767
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,931
We were living in a coldwater flat
near the university.

768
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:23,208
And while l did what wives
did in those days,

769
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:26,614
outside, the streets were
on fire with protests.

770
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,881
- The Vietnam war.
- l would carry you out into the crowd

771
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,151
and listen to the speeches,
and then one day,

772
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,454
something just clicked,
and l had to join.

773
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:38,290
So l--
l had to leave.

774
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:41,162
Yeah, but why did-- why didn't you
take me with you?

775
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:45,430
Well, because my friends
fought for peace.

776
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,994
We armed ourselves.
We were militant.

777
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:51,838
- And someone got killed.
- Yeah.

778
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:56,141
- And l ran, and l kept running.
- Jesus.

779
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:02,145
So now after 35 years,
l've decided to stop the marathon.

780
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,353
l'm gonna
turn myself in.

781
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:10,583
- But what'll ha--
- l don't know what'll happen to me,

782
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:13,722
and l don't know
if l'll go to prison.

783
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:15,755
But l wanted
to see you again

784
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:17,596
and spend a few hours
with you

785
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,866
and get to know you a little before
whatever happens does happen.

786
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,838
No. No.

787
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:25,808
No, no,
l can't lose you now.

788
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:28,175
Not after
all these years.

789
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:29,702
Fuck that.

790
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,977
- Don't give yourself up.
- l have to, Ryan.

791
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:35,508
l'm no good to you
unless l'm true to who l am.

792
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:41,983
Fuck.

793
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:44,017
Look...

794
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,255
l wasn't going
to tell you this,

795
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,290
at least not yet.

796
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:54,062
What if l told you
l could fix it

797
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:55,867
so we could be together?

798
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,931
What do you mean?

799
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,637
A friend of mine
is going to help me and Cyril escape.

800
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:03,169
No, Ryan,
don't do that.

801
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:05,113
- Why the fuck not?
- Because...

802
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:07,913
you'll have to spend the rest
of your life doing what l've done,

803
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,511
hiding and lying
and living in fear...

804
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,317
and denying
who you are.

805
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:14,324
And that's a life
without meaning.

806
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:16,918
And a life without meaning
is no life at all.

807
00:50:18,395 --> 00:50:21,057
Visit's over, O'Reily.

808
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:29,600
Mom.

809
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,407
You called me Mom.

810
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:39,446
l love you, Ryan.

811
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:43,579
l always have,
and l always will.

812
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,351
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

813
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:12,548
Bad news.

814
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:15,609
The Attorney General
has circumvented the law of asylum.

815
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,449
You're saying
we've lost the fight?

816
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:21,985
Your deportation
has been ordered.

817
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:25,085
A week from today, you'll be standing
before a British judge.

818
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:31,926
Once l get there,
l'll not get a fair trial. l'll hang.

819
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,869
l know.

820
00:51:44,515 --> 00:51:46,210
You admit to murdering him
even though you know

821
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,150
l could tell the warden
that you confessed,

822
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:50,585
and you'd probably end up
on death row.

823
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:52,612
Yes.

824
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:59,486
- Hey.
- Hey.

825
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,157
How's Cyril?

826
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:03,996
Oh, he's a little anxious to get out
of protective custody,

827
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:05,661
but he's okay.

828
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:07,431
Hey, did you--

829
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:10,065
did you give any more thought
to what we talked about?

830
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:13,338
Any thought? Your little proposition
had me sleepless for three nights.

831
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:15,368
And what have
you decided?

832
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:20,984
Here.

833
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:23,009
Why are you
giving me this?

834
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:25,112
10 minutes ago,
the warden asked me

835
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:26,850
if l knew anything
about Keenan's death.

836
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,791
- What?
- l lied and said no.

837
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:33,092
Oh, man.
Thank, Christ.

838
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,997
Ryan, as we speak,
the medical board is deliberating

839
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:38,194
whether or not l'm qualified
to hold this job.

840
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:43,066
They're questioning
my ethics, okay?

841
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:45,370
My initial reaction was,
''How can they do that?''

842
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,468
But...

843
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,843
you know what?

844
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,848
Now l'm questioning
my ethics.

845
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:54,009
Now look.

846
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:56,815
Love is more important
than ethics.

847
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:59,982
Well, now how would
you know that?

848
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:01,888
l mean, your ethics,
what few you have,

849
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:03,449
are completely
screwed up.

850
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:06,361
Whoa. Why the fuck
are you doing this?

851
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:09,991
l should tell Leo
that you beat Keenan to death.

852
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:14,435
l should do it...

853
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:16,439
but l won't.
God help me.

854
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:20,933
- Hey, Gloria--
- And l am not going to help you escape.

855
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:24,003
Do you
understand that?

856
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,879
l will not do it.

857
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:28,475
And if you
ask me again,

858
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,215
l will tell
the warden everything.

859
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:34,117
Officer,
we're done here.

860
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:40,897
l do have ethics,

861
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:42,922
and l'm not screwed up.

862
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:02,910
What do you want?

863
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:06,389
l've been on the computer
reading about the troubles.

864
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,584
lt's not at all about God.

865
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,616
lt's about the money.

866
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:13,562
lt's about the--
the Protestants taking Catholic land.

867
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:15,827
How could you not
hate the British?

868
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:19,529
l mean, if you've got any balls at all,
then you'd better be lRA

869
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,868
You know, fighting for what's
rightfully yours.

870
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:24,271
And what good does
your newfound knowledge

871
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:27,436
and all this enthusiasm
do for either of us?

872
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:31,379
l want to be part of something,
something that matters.

873
00:54:31,415 --> 00:54:34,714
Don't laugh at me,
Connolly.

874
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,844
Hey, everyone knows
l get things done.

875
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,378
That's my talent.

876
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:41,186
Let me help you do
something for the cause.

877
00:54:41,224 --> 00:54:44,489
Hmm?
Something for lreland?

878
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:56,434
All righty.

879
00:54:58,442 --> 00:55:00,433
l know what
we should do.

880
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:13,946
Hey.

881
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:19,656
- Two gallons of bleach.
- Good.

882
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:21,561
All your whites
are clean,

883
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:24,499
so are you going to tell me now
why you needed this stuff so bad?

884
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,331
No. Can you get me
a wristwatch?

885
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,806
A wristwatch?
Why?

886
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,278
Connolly, what the fuck
are you doing?

887
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:38,042
Would you be willing
to die with me?

888
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:42,048
Would you?

889
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:01,366
The bleach and the wristwatch
are part of my grand scheme.

890
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:06,467
- Which is what?
- To make a bomb.

891
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:09,206
You and me, O'Reily,

892
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:11,680
we're going to blow up
Emerald City.

893
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:27,226
ln any sport,
to experience victory,

894
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:29,129
the one element you
need more than any other...

895
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,793
is teamwork.

896
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,859
But teamwork is also the
scariest notion

897
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:35,235
a person can face.

898
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:37,763
Joining a team means giving up
part of your individuality,

899
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:40,003
being willing to make
whatever sacrifice

900
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:42,011
is necessary
for the greater cause.

901
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:43,945
lf you're willing
to do these things,

902
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,107
to truly become
a team player,

903
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:48,310
then success
will follow.

904
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:50,512
But a word
of caution:

905
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:53,148
Be sure that the success
you go after...

906
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:58,358
is the success you need.
