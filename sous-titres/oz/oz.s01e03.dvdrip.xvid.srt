1
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,110
ln the beginning,
God was nothing.

2
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:42,271
So he started making stuff.

3
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:45,324
He made the dirt, he made the sky,
he made the water,

4
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:48,107
he made things that swim,
things that slither, things with legs.

5
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,575
l mean, God turned himself
into a big shot.

6
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:52,989
Then, in a couple of days,
or a couple of million years,

7
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,450
he breathed life into man.

8
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:58,954
And he's been sucking the life
out of us ever since.

9
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:02,007
l am the resurrection and the life.

10
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,303
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

11
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,636
yet shall he live.

12
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:14,388
lt's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord

13
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:20,443
Standing in the need of prayer

14
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,823
lt's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord--

15
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:32,037
People, we've got three murders
in two weeks.

16
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:35,291
l got the commissioner
yelling in my ear

17
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,495
and the press shoved up my ass.

18
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:42,374
The governor's threatening
to send in the feds.

19
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:46,130
And my daughter wants to move
into an apartment with her boyfriend.

20
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:47,839
Somebody help me out here.

21
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:51,388
--it's me, O Lord

22
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:56,516
Standing in the need of prayer--

23
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:00,982
Post burned Ortolani, so obviously
the Wiseguys wasted Post.

24
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,724
- The next move is Jefferson Keane's.
- And he's gonna make it.

25
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:05,018
No, not necessarily.

26
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:08,400
l've noticed a change in the guy.
A slight change.

27
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:10,199
Maybe it's because he got married.

28
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,657
Or maybe he's just tired
of the gangster way of life.

29
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:15,706
--it's me, O Lord

30
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:17,665
Standing in the need--

31
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,245
We hit this guy hard right now,

32
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,335
all his street instincts
are gonna pop back up.

33
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:24,417
This is one case where we can't meet
violence with violence.

34
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:36,935
--need of prayer

35
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:39,262
When are we gonna kill
those wops?

36
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,186
You know Glynn is gonna lock
this place down any minute.

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,729
You sure the wops killed Johnny?

38
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,070
Kill him.

39
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,781
And start with his dick.

40
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:51,237
Just give me the word,
those wops are dead.

41
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:53,076
Everything's all right. Just chill.

42
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,409
What? You don't give a shit?

43
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:58,493
You know l give a shit.
l had much love for Johnny.

44
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,282
- Well, you ain't showing it.
- Yeah, man. Last few days

45
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:03,917
you seemed like a million years away.
What's up with that?

46
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:08,342
We also gotta find out who ratted
on Johnny and kill those fuckers too.

47
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:12,930
Mr. Schibetta,
l know who killed Dino.

48
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,555
l know who ratted on Johnny.
l just ain't saying.

49
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,437
- How's the white race?
- l'll kill that motherfucker myself.

50
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:23,229
Okay, you're the boss.

51
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:31,241
Yo. Now, the Wiseguys know
that Johnny killed Ortolani,

52
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:34,820
but do they know
who ordered the hit?

53
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,155
Watch your back, brother.
You could be next.

54
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:43,075
- Let the fuckers come. Please.
- All right.

55
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:45,287
Being in a gang is a lot
like being in a religion.

56
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:48,548
You got rules to follow,
a leader to obey,

57
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:51,587
and at the heart, it's about love.

58
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,130
''Love thy fellow man''
becomes ''Love thy brother gangster. ''

59
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:58,634
But what if you stop believing
the religion you've been preaching?

60
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:01,972
You come to see that the hole
is still in your soul,

61
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,685
that the God/love you thought you had
is nothing but a hologram.

62
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:12,027
Hey, Mavis. Yeah, it's me baby.
How you doing?

63
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,151
What you doing?

64
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:18,362
Really? What you wearing?

65
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,582
Oh, yeah.

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,167
Say that again.
Say that again, like that. Yeah.

67
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,508
l like that. Oh, baby, yeah.

68
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:34,003
Yeah, now l'm feeling you baby.
You go ahead.

69
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:36,634
Now l'm feeling you, definitely.
Oh, yeah.

70
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,174
What did you say? You say you want
me to spank that ass?

71
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:41,383
Oh, damn.

72
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:57,828
l gotta be interrogated
by Burrano again.

73
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:00,194
Like l know anything
about Johnny Post.

74
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,869
They cut off his dick
and stuck it in his mouth.

75
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,375
- Where'd you hear that?
- God told me.

76
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:12,709
Yo, yo, ltalian ice, what's up?

77
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,095
You ever hear how
the word ''doo-wop'' came to pass?

78
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,428
No, man, tell me about it.

79
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:25,727
Well, over in Harlem town,
back in the old days,

80
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:30,773
a couple of ltalians were giving muscle
to a cat running a speakeasy.

81
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:34,319
He was doing a set,
l think maybe of Billie Holiday.

82
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:37,526
These ltalians come into the club

83
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,989
thinking they can push
a brother around.

84
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,904
But instead, the brother finds a blunt.

85
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:47,786
And outside in the alley, while
Miss Billie Holiday is singing the blues,

86
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:51,711
the brother do the wops.

87
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,258
And that's how doo-wop was born.

88
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,633
How'd you like Johnny Post's dick
up your ass?

89
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,259
How would you like to put it there?

90
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,563
Shit!

91
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,409
Break it up now! Break it up!

92
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:43,677
Fuck this! Yeah, that's right.

93
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,724
That's right!

94
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,890
l want the SORT team put on alert.

95
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,853
And leave word for the commissioner
to call me ASAP.

96
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,442
Yeah.

97
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:14,001
- Gentlemen, we have a problem.
- They know why they're here.

98
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,128
l want the violence to stop
before anyone else dies,

99
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:24,305
before this place
is flooded with feds,

100
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:26,718
before we have a full-blown riot.

101
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,932
Nobody wants a riot, right?

102
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:34,476
- Schibetta?
- No.

103
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:38,279
- Keane?
- No.

104
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:40,316
Said?

105
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,904
Violence for its own sake
accomplishes nothing.

106
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:47,579
Then spread the word
that if one more fight breaks out,

107
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:51,199
l'm gonna shut this prison down
so hard, so fast,

108
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:54,745
you won't see daylight
till the third millennium.

109
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,872
Everybody got that?

110
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:04,878
What'd you find out?

111
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:07,630
Said, Schibetta and Keane
agreed to keep the peace.

112
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:10,389
Yo, so Glynn said he ain't
gonna lock us down yet.

113
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:13,973
lt's madness. lt's madness.

114
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:22,231
To belong, you gotta be able to deal.

115
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,782
You gotta share power.
You gotta share pain.

116
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:31,282
- What's that?
- Probably some cannolis and shit.

117
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,210
- Cannolis?
- Oh, goddamn!

118
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:36,703
- What?
- Motherfucker, Johnny's dick!

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,925
- Shit! Goddamn!
- Oh, fuck!

120
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:43,626
Motherfuckers!

121
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:46,925
There's some pain
that you don't share,

122
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,474
some pain like your fingerprints,
that's all yours,

123
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:53,635
all alone.

124
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:20,797
Fire! Fire! Fire!
There's a fucking--! Get the fuck up!

125
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:25,504
Fire! Fire!

126
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:37,137
Pyro fuck, huh?
You're a little pyro fucker, are we?

127
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:40,103
You wanna tell me
what the fuck you did that for?

128
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:41,985
- l was bored.
- Bullshit.

129
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:44,395
l've watched you since the day
you checked into Em City.

130
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:46,856
l've seen you make cold,
calculated decisions.

131
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:48,700
l've seen you restrain
loose cannons.

132
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:51,027
Now, all of a sudden,
you torch your fucking mattress

133
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,363
knowing it's gonna
end you up in the hole.

134
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:56,452
You wanna go to lockup so bad,
because why?

135
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:58,328
Someone's after you?

136
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:00,454
l never ran away
from a fight in my life.

137
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:02,380
Then what?

138
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,590
l just wanna spend
some time alone.

139
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:07,918
Well, you're gonna do that.

140
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:09,507
Officer.

141
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:12,558
You know, your brother Billie's
coming back from the hospital.

142
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,799
So l hear.

143
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,519
Yeah, but he's not gonna be
in Em City.

144
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,265
He's gonna be in Cellblock 3.

145
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,358
Fucking fag unit.

146
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,936
Take him to ad seg.

147
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,816
Keane.

148
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,740
l wish you'd learn to trust me.

149
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,125
Hello, Keane.

150
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,502
- What the fuck is that about?
- A little warning.

151
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,593
Nothing better happen
to Ryan O'Reily.

152
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:23,247
Patrick, you're-- Fuck!

153
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:32,429
Freeze! Stop! Get down!
Don't you move!

154
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,762
Check the car. Stay still.

155
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:40,093
Prisoner number 97P904,
Ryan O'Reily.

156
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:43,184
Convicted July 1 2th, '97.

157
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,185
Two counts
of vehicular manslaughter,

158
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:49,482
five counts of reckless endangerment,
possession of controlled substance,

159
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:53,149
criminal possession of a weapon,
parole violation.

160
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:59,656
Sentence: life imprisonment.
Up for parole in 1 2 years.

161
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,163
So this dude,
he's fiending for a cigarette.

162
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,577
l mean, he's about to smoke
the stuffing in his mattress

163
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,249
he's dying so bad.

164
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:08,920
So he comes to me
and he asks me for a cig.

165
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,215
Just one to get him
through the night.

166
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:15,135
He begs me on his knees,
weeping like a little girl:

167
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:18,806
''Please? Please? Please?''

168
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,470
So pathetic. l said no.

169
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,846
- You said no.
- Well, actually l lied.

170
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:28,777
l told him that l was out,
l didn't have any.

171
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,229
l don't think he believed me.

172
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:33,108
And you said no because...?

173
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:37,369
For his own good.
He's gotta kick the habit, right?

174
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:42,665
- So you were being altruistic?
- Whatever.

175
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,167
So you weren't
actually committing a sin.

176
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:47,122
No, Father.

177
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:50,542
Then why did you come
to confession?

178
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:53,208
- The truth?
- Sure.

179
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:55,919
l figured when l was done
l could sneak a smoke.

180
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:59,264
They say confession
is good for the soul.

181
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:02,346
You go into a confessional
and you can tell a priest anything.

182
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,719
Anything!

183
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:06,222
And he can't repeat it.

184
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:10,273
You go into an interview room with
your local PD and say what you done--

185
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:13,897
Well, the cops are telling the DA
and the papers and everybody else.

186
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:15,236
So you do some deed

187
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:18,777
and you want to clean your conscience
and still get away with it?

188
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:22,821
Well, tell your mama or tell a priest.

189
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:40,722
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- Okay.

190
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:43,134
Can you believe that shit
that's going down around here?

191
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:48,306
Three guys capped in three weeks?
That's fucked up.

192
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:49,984
Yep.

193
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:52,063
You're a lawyer, right?

194
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:57,239
l was disbarred automatically
after l was convicted of a felony.

195
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,448
Even so, how come you ain't
appealing your case

196
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:00,782
and shit like that?

197
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,617
l did. My appeal was rejected.

198
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:04,863
How come?

199
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:09,002
l was drunk driving.
l killed a little girl.

200
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,665
They decided
to make an example of me,

201
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,377
so they sent me here
instead of some cushy Club Med.

202
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,293
Maybe you can help me out.
My attorney was a raging dickbrain.

203
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,297
He just fucking rolled over in court.

204
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,592
Could you take a look at my case

205
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,344
and see if there's
any way l can appeal?

206
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:26,519
l didn't do criminal law.
l was in litigation.

207
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,303
l'm telling you, man,
l gotta get out of this place.

208
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,529
Okay.

209
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:37,527
Ryan O'Reily.

210
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,695
Tobias Beecher.

211
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,412
When you pray,
do you go into a zone?

212
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:47,286
Does the rest of the world
drop away?

213
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,211
l never been there.
God and coma.

214
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,623
l can say an Our Father and think
about lunch at the same time.

215
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,381
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name--

216
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,924
Some people say
that if you don't accept Jesus Christ

217
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,884
as the son of God,
as your personal saviour,

218
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:05,347
you won't go to heaven.

219
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,182
But is there a guarantee
that if you do believe in Jesus,

220
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:09,974
you will be saved?

221
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:14,098
Or will God, the great practical joker,
leave you hanging?

222
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:20,025
Hey, sweet pea.
How was church, huh?

223
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,818
You feeling all sanctified and pure?

224
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:27,363
Get undressed.
We're taking a shower.

225
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,699
l already took a shower.

226
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,703
Oh, that's okay.

227
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:34,665
When l'm done with you,
you'll need another one.

228
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,761
So my assistant got paroled.

229
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,757
See, that's what's wrong
with this place.

230
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:46,381
You finally break in an assistant,
he learns your rhythms,

231
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,018
he's good at the job
and then:

232
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:51,063
The parole board decides
that he's ready to rejoin society.

233
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:55,857
Meanwhile, l am left with a stack
of untyped psychiatric reports.

234
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,937
Sister, l'm glad you thought
of me for this job.

235
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:59,904
l really wasn't suited
for factory work.

236
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:02,688
Listen, when l heard
you knew Word and Lotus,

237
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,198
l knelt down and praised Jesus.

238
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,237
l'm lucky he heard you.
He hasn't been listening to me.

239
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:13,206
- Oh, yes, he does. He listens.
- No, he doesn't.

240
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:18,206
Since l got to Oz, l've prayed more
than the night before my bar exam,

241
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:21,918
more than the day my son fell off
his skateboard.

242
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:26,843
Either God's hearing has gotten bad
or he's ignoring me.

243
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:30,677
No, listen. First of all, quantity
of prayer doesn't mean anything.

244
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:33,600
And secondly,
maybe he has answered you,

245
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,523
only it's not what you expect.

246
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:40,230
God almighty, creator of all things,
including the loophole.

247
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:42,071
Come on.

248
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:46,865
There's your desk, such as it is.

249
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,248
Tobias,

250
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,871
what do you ask for when you pray?

251
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,914
To get out of here.

252
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:05,134
You don't need God for that.
You just need a good lawyer.

253
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:13,183
l spent my life dealing with the law,
finding ways over, under, around it.

254
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:15,643
And then when l needed it
to be there for me,

255
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:19,191
the system snapped back
into my face.

256
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:23,486
l was a good lawyer. l was.

257
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:25,480
l was a lot of things:

258
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,617
A husband, father,
son, brother, friend.

259
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:32,575
And then l made a mistake.

260
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:36,367
One huge, huge mistake,
but one mistake.

261
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,669
And as a result,

262
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,004
God took everything.

263
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:48,255
Listen, maybe he stripped you
of the superficial sense of yourself--

264
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,430
You know, doctor,
lawyer, lndian chief.

265
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:55,019
--so that you could find the real you
through him.

266
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,221
That's what l'm saying.
That's what l've been trying to do.

267
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,977
But God isn't in Oz.

268
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:06,445
Oh, yeah, he is. He is everywhere.
He is in you right now, Tobias.

269
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,366
Genevieve is divorcing me.

270
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:17,706
l think she decided when she saw
the swastika on my butt.

271
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,963
She's gonna take the kids
and go live with her parents.

272
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:28,469
lf God is in me, he's a tumour.

273
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:41,935
Wow?

274
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,858
lt's ''Mom.''

275
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:49,981
One of these Muslim monkeys
was trying to tell me

276
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,868
that Jesus was a nigger.

277
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:57,031
He even quoted from the Bible
trying to back his shit up.

278
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:00,127
Well, Jesus was from Judea,

279
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:03,913
so he was probably
of an olive-coloured skin.

280
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,217
Look at that picture there.
Does that look like a nigger to you?

281
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:11,554
No.

282
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,680
You're getting awful mouthy,
aren't you, prag?

283
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:18,646
No, sir. l am not, sir.

284
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:21,726
Yeah, l think l'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.

285
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:26,228
Polish my boots.

286
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:29,358
Yes, sir.

287
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,525
With your tongue.

288
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,881
Son of a bitch.

289
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,294
- Hey, lawboy.
- Yeah?

290
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:53,594
How's my appeal coming?

291
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,889
- You been crying?
- No.

292
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,602
Sure you have.

293
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:01,018
That's okay, man.
l cry, too, sometimes.

294
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:04,226
Look, you'd have to be
brain-dead not to.

295
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,734
But l got a cure
for the blues, homey.

296
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:09,352
Come on.

297
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:16,703
What's going on?

298
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:19,073
Hug the wall.

299
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,003
Let's get high.

300
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:28,748
Count time, gentlemen!
ln front of your cells!

301
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,884
Count!

302
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:36,256
92M758, 93C4 72.

303
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:41,593
May the road rise up to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.

304
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,889
May the sun shine
warm upon your face

305
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:46,936
and rain fall soft upon your fields.

306
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:52,608
And until we meet again, may God
hold you in the hollow of his hand.

307
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:59,612
- Where you been, prag?
- Nowhere, sir.

308
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,949
You're fucked up.

309
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,493
Yes, sir.

310
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:09,924
l don't want you doing drugs,
sharing needles. Understand?

311
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:11,171
Yes, sir.

312
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:13,211
Listen to me, bitch.

313
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:15,628
l catch you so much
as snorting fucking lint,

314
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:18,094
l'm gonna beat the shit out of you.

315
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:22,686
Yes, sir. But you can do whatever
you want to me. l don't care.

316
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:25,434
Yeah, because you're high.

317
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,357
Because God is everywhere

318
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:31,688
and God is holding me
in the hollow of his hand.

319
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,738
Praise the Lord
and pass the ammunition.

320
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,081
- What?
- l don't know what to do.

321
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:46,710
l've never done confession before.

322
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:50,496
l didn't think that you were Catholic.
What are you doing here?

323
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,791
l got caught sneaking
into the morgue again.

324
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:56,295
You ever seen a guy
with his prick cut off?

325
00:22:56,721 --> 00:23:00,340
- No, l can't say that l have.
- lt's not pretty.

326
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:02,889
l got put in the hole.

327
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:06,438
The hack comes around and says
that he'll let me out for ten minutes

328
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:09,097
- if l need to see you, so l say yes.
- You have to go back.

329
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,517
Wait, Father, maybe l'm a convert.

330
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,978
You can't become a Catholic
just to get out of the hole.

331
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:15,187
- Come on.
- No, no, wait.

332
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:17,903
l've been reading a lot since l got here
about different faiths

333
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,828
- and yours is pretty nifty.
- Catholicism is nifty?

334
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:25,492
You have that whole mystical
transubstantiation bit going.

335
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:29,459
That's right. The Eucharist
becomes the body of Christ.

336
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,162
So you're actually eating his flesh
and drinking his blood.

337
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,127
- That's right.
- Now, how can l not get

338
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,044
behind a religion like that?

339
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:43,055
And God said, ''Let there be light. ''

340
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,060
And there was light.

341
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:51,566
Well, that's easy for God to say.
He's God.

342
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:54,694
But for the rest of us,
finding the light takes time.

343
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:56,944
A lifetime.

344
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:20,053
Jefferson, meet your new roommate,
Kenny Wangler.

345
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:32,733
Fuck you!

346
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:44,407
Prisoner number 97W566,
Kenneth Wangler. Yeah, boy.

347
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:49,781
Sixteen years old tried as an adult.
Convicted July 6th, '97.

348
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:54,081
Murder in the first degree.
Sentence: 20 years.

349
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:57,506
Up for parole in six. Yeah.

350
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:03,096
My man here told me
that y'all was the crew to get with.

351
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:05,722
l wanna be G.

352
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:08,476
l'll think about it.

353
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,225
What the hell is there
to think about?

354
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:14,936
l said l'll fucking think about it,
all right?

355
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,323
We're gonna need
every man we can get

356
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,328
if we're gonna shackle
with those Wiseguys.

357
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,499
Keep thinking.

358
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:48,804
ln Oz, sometimes the things
you can't touch

359
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,058
are more real
than the things you can.

360
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:57,018
For instance, fear, hatred, loneliness,
are more real to me than a shank.

361
00:25:57,235 --> 00:26:02,443
And a soul, everyday, can grow
into something you can almost hold.

362
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:05,148
How fucked up is that?

363
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:10,114
ln a shithole like this,
to first and finally see the face of God.

364
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:17,915
Minister Said.

365
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,918
How you doing? l just wanted
to shake your hand. Shake the hand.

366
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:26,636
lt's like, l saw you talk on TV
the other day and the things you said--

367
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:27,886
Like, the things you said--

368
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:30,893
l just want to shake the hand of
the man who said the things you said.

369
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:33,724
- What is your name, little brother?
- Kenny. Kenny Wangler.

370
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:36,145
Kenny. Well, Kenny,

371
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:41,395
the things that l say out loud,
you already know.

372
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:44,021
These are words
that are buried deep in your heart.

373
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:47,197
Do you understand me,
little brother?

374
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,828
Let's welcome the little brother.

375
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,879
What's up? How you doing?
What's going on?

376
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,538
You have been robbed, Kenny.

377
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:05,417
And you have been robbed
of a very special gift.

378
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:08,424
lt's a gift that can never be replaced.

379
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,551
What's that?

380
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:16,227
Your childhood, Kenny.
Your youth.

381
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:17,512
But the thief was tricky,

382
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:21,523
because he fooled you
by leaving something in its place.

383
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:24,780
Fear.

384
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:30,610
- l ain't afraid of nothing.
- We're all afraid of something, Kenny.

385
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:33,079
See, me, l was afraid of being poor.

386
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,160
But, see, you've got
no fear now, right?

387
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:37,497
Yes, l do.

388
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,036
l fear God, Kenny.

389
00:27:40,255 --> 00:27:42,663
And l love God.

390
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,750
lt's what we call taqwa.

391
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:50,593
- What's taqwa?
- Never mind. lt doesn't matter.

392
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:53,346
You want to be in a gang, right?

393
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:58,226
l want you to be in my gang.

394
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,897
l want you to follow us.

395
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,393
Follow our style,

396
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,859
and you can learn
to be a real man.

397
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:50,355
Mr. Woodson. Hey.

398
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,864
Yeah. ls Mavis there?

399
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,995
She's out? Where'd she go?

400
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:01,826
What you mean you can't tell me?

401
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:07,257
Don't tell me you don't know!
You track every move that girl makes!

402
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:09,627
Yeah, l'm calling you a liar,
motherfucker,

403
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:12,092
because you ain't telling me
the truth!

404
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:15,968
Tell me where the fuck Mavis
is now!

405
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:30,360
Bitches. All women is bitches.

406
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:33,610
Yeah, man, we don't know
Mavis is cheating, man.

407
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:35,535
l know.

408
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:48,790
That boy is 1 6 years old
and he's in for 20,

409
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,384
which means he can be out in six.

410
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:53,423
He could be back on the street
by the time he's 22.

411
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:56,129
He can still have a life.

412
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:00,517
- Get the fuck out of here, Kenny.
- What?

413
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,220
You heard me.
l said get the fuck going.

414
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,013
Come on, Kenny,
let's give them some privacy.

415
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:11,113
Later.

416
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:18,866
You wanna rage at the faith?

417
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,872
You feel the fire, my brother.

418
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:25,124
Feel the fire.

419
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:28,544
l am done with you.

420
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:33,048
Reverend.

421
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,351
l do.

422
00:30:51,446 --> 00:30:52,857
l do feel the fire.

423
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,859
Save me.

424
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,499
Oh, no.

425
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:17,095
You save me.

426
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:20,472
Some say finding God
is a glorious thing.

427
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:23,768
They're wrong. lt's dangerous.

428
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:26,517
You spend your whole life
in a world of men.

429
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:30,943
But when you finally see his power,
his greatness,

430
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:32,653
other men fall out of view.

431
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:34,820
Because you're so focused on him,

432
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:37,569
you can barely see them
from the corners of your eyes.

433
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:39,741
You lose sight of them.

434
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:46,996
- Hey.
- Hey.

435
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,832
- l'm out of the hospital.
- l see.

436
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:52,253
You gonna give me a hug or what?

437
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:01,343
Thanks for taking care of Ortolani.

438
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:06,517
What's the matter?
You ain't glad to see me?

439
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:09,523
Things have changed, Billie.
l've changed.

440
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:11,518
Now you gonna have to change too.

441
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,146
Change? How?

442
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,153
You have to stop being a fag,
that's how.

443
00:32:15,322 --> 00:32:17,694
Stop? l can't stop. l don't wanna.

444
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:19,781
lf you don't stop,
l can't protect you no more.

445
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,529
Fine.

446
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:24,403
lf you don't stop,
you can't be my brother no more.

447
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,410
Fine.

448
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:30,415
l'll beat the black off you

449
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:34,003
- if you don't stop being a faggot.
- No, brother, no.

450
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,587
No, no, no.

451
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:42,474
But l thought you said that
we're not down with faggots.

452
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:45,470
lslam rejects homosexuality, yes.

453
00:32:45,685 --> 00:32:49,351
But you are never gonna reach
Billie's heart through intimidation.

454
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:51,557
You have to learn to open up yours

455
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:55,316
and show him the way by example,
as l did to you.

456
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:57,486
Through love.

457
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:01,232
Reverend, l hear what
you're saying to me, but it's hard.

458
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:03,859
l mean, l been using these
my whole life to settle things.

459
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:05,068
And that's okay, brother.

460
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:08,117
Ain't nobody expecting you
to change overnight.

461
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,583
We all have to struggle
with the devil and his temptations.

462
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,953
But you see, it's like this.

463
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:19,130
Right now you have Allah
on your side.

464
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:21,509
And you can call him,

465
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,306
and he will come, my brother,
and he will give you strength.

466
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:39,773
lt's just that l feel so bad

467
00:33:39,948 --> 00:33:42,735
and so ashamed of everything
l did before.

468
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:46,201
lt's like l feel as though
l should be going around

469
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:49,954
to all the people that l hurt
and telling them l'm sorry.

470
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,500
Then that's what you must do.

471
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:55,039
You go out there and you make
your enemies your friends.

472
00:33:55,255 --> 00:33:56,334
They're my friends?

473
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:01,712
Well, now, you're gonna have
to prepare yourself, brother.

474
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:04,218
You see, your faith
is gonna be a threat to them.

475
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:07,004
You're gonna have
to love them all the more.

476
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,972
Yo, Kenny, l see that drug counsellor
doing you a whole hell of a lot of good.

477
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:16,852
Yo, man, fuck
that drug counsellor, man.

478
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:18,307
Fuck him.

479
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,687
What are you doing here?

480
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,777
Yo, Jefferson, what's up, man?

481
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,946
Brothers, my name is now
Tizi Ouzou.

482
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,780
T what?

483
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:31,863
Step up, Brother Tizi. Step up.

484
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,246
l'm done with that.

485
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:35,752
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

486
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:38,584
Simon, we've been doing it
all wrong, brother.

487
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,963
The whole package.
This is not the way.

488
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:43,043
l told you,
Said's been fucking with his head.

489
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,797
We gotta cut out all this hatred.

490
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:47,421
We need to learn to love one another,
embrace one another.

491
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:50,310
The only person
we need to be fearing is God.

492
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:53,389
Motherfucker,
shut the fuck up with that shit.

493
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:58,019
Are you still with us?
Are you still a brother?

494
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,144
l am your brother.

495
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:03,531
- We all God's--
- l said cut that shit, nigga.

496
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,572
What l mean is, you still a brother?

497
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:12,329
Like this? Doing this? No.

498
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,460
Get the fuck away from me.

499
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:25,292
Homeboy getting soft, man.

500
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,222
He come here and ask
for love and shit.

501
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,639
Give me that shit.

502
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:37,559
Fucking faggot, just like his brother.

503
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:47,024
Hey, l just mopped there, asswipes.

504
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:51,738
- What's up, coz?
- Follow me. Be cool.

505
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,199
We must repent
for what we did to Ortolani

506
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,750
and for getting Johnny killed.

507
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,747
Repent? Are you kidding
or are you high?

508
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:02,288
l ain't gonna rat on you.
And l ain't gonna tell no one

509
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:05,039
that you set it up with the hacks
to get Johnny in the hole.

510
00:36:05,218 --> 00:36:08,801
Why you being so good to me?
What's the catch?

511
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,140
l tell, you die.

512
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,681
And l would much rather
you see the sins you've committed

513
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:17,386
and, like myself,
try to change your ways.

514
00:36:17,606 --> 00:36:19,563
You are high.

515
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:31,944
Mr. Schibetta?

516
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:37,948
Jefferson Keane
ordered the hit on Dino.

517
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:40,664
Let me arrange for Keane to die.

518
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:44,375
Why would you wanna do that?

519
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,040
As a sign of good faith between us.

520
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,052
- Good faith?
- Yeah.

521
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:53,473
All right.

522
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:00,309
Why are you letting him
take care of this?

523
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:04,728
He wants to get his hands dirty,
what do l care?

524
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:10,567
Besides, this way
the niggers will kill him.

525
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:18,623
What do you need?

526
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,999
Okay, Keane, you're coming with us.

527
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:33,722
- Why? What'd l do?
- Move your ass!

528
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,180
The man asked a question.
What'd he do?

529
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:45,106
l don't have to explain anything to you,
your holiness.

530
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,835
- Where the hell are you taking me?
- Shut the fuck up!

531
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,833
What's this about?

532
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:15,847
l ain't got no beef with y'all.
l don't wanna fight nobody.

533
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,393
Let the games begin.

534
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:55,838
Hey, look at that.
The motherfucker killed Martinez.

535
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,135
No! No!

536
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:07,941
No! No! No!

537
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:15,317
Lock it down.

538
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:24,285
lt's a lockdown! Get to your cells!

539
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:35,508
l am deeply concerned
by the rash of murders

540
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,384
that have occurred in Oswald
over the past few weeks.

541
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:41,012
And though l have every confidence

542
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:43,722
in Warden Glynn here
and his fine staff,

543
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:46,730
l felt it was necessary
to make an on-site inspection.

544
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,980
And we are always happy
to see the governor

545
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,392
and engage in
a free-flowing exchange of ideas.

546
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,811
Now, if you'll excuse us. Governor?

547
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:02,242
What the fuck
are you people doing?

548
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:05,492
Do any of you have a fucking clue
as to how to run this prison?

549
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:08,540
Governor, all these deaths
are interrelated.

550
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:12,004
We got a race war in the making and
we're trying to contain the situation.

551
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:13,840
Well, you're not doing
a very good job.

552
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:15,586
And you're not helping much.

553
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:19,136
What? Who are you?

554
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:21,423
Tim McManus. l run Cellblock 5.

555
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:28,439
Oh, yeah. Emerald City.
The wave of the future.

556
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:34,232
You are creating a lot of the tension
that we're dealing with around here.

557
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:35,560
And how am l doing that?

558
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,354
Well, you ban smoking,
you ban conjugals.

559
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:41,529
Bit by bit you're stripping these men
of their basic human needs.

560
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,903
This is a prison.
These men are criminals.

561
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,864
The whole point is to strip them
of their basic human needs.

562
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:50,622
lf a knee-jerk, liberal prissy
like you would see that,

563
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:52,954
we wouldn't be having the problems
we're having today.

564
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:56,251
The campaign's over, governor.
Get off your soapbox.

565
00:40:56,551 --> 00:41:04,179
McManus, when you look at me,
what do you see?

566
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:07,259
A man.

567
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:10,932
You've heard of Olympus, right?

568
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:13,681
Mount Olympus in ancient Greece,
where the gods lived?

569
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:16,310
- Yeah.
- Well, there was a hierarchy,

570
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,238
even among the gods.

571
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:22,614
Mercury was lesser than Apollo,
Apollo lesser than Zeus.

572
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,497
Now, you run your cellblock
and you think you're a god.

573
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:28,991
Glynn runs the whole prison,
he thinks he's a greater god.

574
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,407
Well, guys,

575
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:34,002
l am Zeus.

576
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:36,712
l am omnipotent.

577
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:39,083
l must be obeyed

578
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:44,216
or my thunderbolts will strike.

579
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:48,303
You're not Zeus. You're a politician.

580
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,347
McManus, take a walk,
you're not helping.

581
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:52,106
Fine.

582
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:56,441
- Thank you, warden.
- Devlin, tell me what you want.

583
00:41:57,487 --> 00:42:00,488
One, l want the murders to stop.

584
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:03,653
Two, l want this Jefferson Keane
to go on trial.

585
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:06,994
l want him convicted
and l want him to die.

586
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,534
He's gonna be the first executed

587
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:11,661
now that l've brought
the death penalty back.

588
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:13,033
Three, end the lockdown.

589
00:42:13,253 --> 00:42:14,533
What?

590
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:17,500
The public hears the whole prison
is locked down, they get tense.

591
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:19,210
They think we've lost control.

592
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:21,668
The fact that we're in lockdown
proves we're in control.

593
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:25,931
l'm not talking about what's real,
l'm talking about John Q.'s perception.

594
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:28,928
And what if we have a riot?
What will John Q. think then?

595
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:31,261
What will that do
for your political career?

596
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,149
l wouldn't worry about me, warden.

597
00:42:34,316 --> 00:42:37,186
l'm the one with
the thunderbolts, remember?

598
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:51,540
l just got a call from the governor,

599
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,873
who got a call
from your friend Senator Shriner

600
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:55,704
complaining about
his interference in Oz.

601
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:58,370
Well, Leo, somebody's gotta stop
this fucking little Napoleon.

602
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:00,090
Ken Shriner's got the balls to do it.

603
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,708
Devlin is bringing the FBl
to investigate the murders.

604
00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:04,879
Maybe they'll do a better job
than Burrano has.

605
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:07,054
Hey, this is my prison. Look.

606
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:09,840
l don't want the feds running around,
waking my inmates,

607
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,388
faxing me memorandums.

608
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:12,593
And the last thing l want,

609
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:16,431
the last thing l need, is for you
taking shit like this on yourself.

610
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,944
This is your fault, McManus,
and l won't forget that.

611
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:28,240
Welcome to Oswald.

612
00:43:37,212 --> 00:43:42,337
Johnny Post got into Ortolani's cell
somehow and burned him alive.

613
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,468
You think the guards were involved?

614
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:52,430
Ortolani was strapped down here
when we found him torched.

615
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:54,720
You cut his dick off

616
00:43:55,939 --> 00:43:58,726
because you're the big don.
You can do anything.

617
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:02,777
We found Post tied up here.

618
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:05,989
His penis had been cut off
and stuffed in his mouth.

619
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:07,824
l don't understand.

620
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:09,778
How'd it work out
that you and Martinez

621
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:11,827
were in the gym with no guards?

622
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,494
The fight took place here.
Keane snapped Martinez's neck.

623
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:20,540
Come in.

624
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:23,668
- Hi. Jeremy Goldstein.
- Tim McManus.

625
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:26,635
Thanks for taking time
out of your busy day.

626
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:28,968
Well, l want these murders solved
as much as anyone.

627
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:30,426
l'm sure you do.

628
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,223
lnteresting place, Oz.

629
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:35,056
l haven't been called ''kike'' this much
since prep school.

630
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,428
You don't have a problem with me
being Jewish, do you?

631
00:44:37,606 --> 00:44:38,637
No, not at all.

632
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:41,187
You don't think of me
as a Christ killer or anything?

633
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:43,690
Well, l'm not even really sure
that Christ died, so...

634
00:44:43,904 --> 00:44:46,145
Good. Fair enough.

635
00:44:46,406 --> 00:44:51,033
But Dino Ortolani sure as hell did.
Roasted by Johnny Post.

636
00:44:51,203 --> 00:44:52,863
You think he did that
of his own volition?

637
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,119
Probably not.
Post wasn't exactly a brain trust.

638
00:44:55,332 --> 00:44:58,083
So someone told him to off Ortolani,
but we don't know who.

639
00:44:58,293 --> 00:45:01,080
- My guess is Jefferson Keane.
- Keane, yeah.

640
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:04,505
He snaps the neck of a Latino,
one Julio Martinez.

641
00:45:04,716 --> 00:45:06,543
- Why?
- l don't know.

642
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,251
Jefferson hasn't said a word
except to pray ever since.

643
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:11,962
l tried to talk to him earlier, l know.

644
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:14,424
Doesn't it seem odd to you
that Keane and Martinez

645
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:16,261
were left in the gym unsupervised?

646
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:19,052
Yes, in the same way it seems odd

647
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,148
that Post was let into the hole
to burn Ortolani.

648
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:25,360
So l wouldn't be too far off to think
that the guards were involved?

649
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,527
lt's possible. lt's probable.

650
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:29,898
- How about you?
- How about me, what?

651
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:33,153
Would l be too far off to think
that you were involved?

652
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:37,873
Are you saying l'm a suspect?

653
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:42,544
l'm FBl. Until l got a reason
not to believe it, you're a suspect.

654
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:51,006
Here's a pop quiz.
Name the seven deadly sins.

655
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,712
Come on,
you saw that Brad Pitt movie.

656
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:56,933
Lust. Yeah, well,
everybody gets that one, huh?

657
00:45:57,144 --> 00:46:00,394
Gluttony, sure. Greed, yeah.

658
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:04,817
Envy, sloth, anger--
Or to be a little more technical, wrath.

659
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:08,775
What else? What else?

660
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:11,610
Let me put it this way:
if you think you know the answer

661
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:15,366
and because of that, you think
you're better than everybody else,

662
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,904
then you're guilty of it.

663
00:47:05,295 --> 00:47:09,162
Prisoner number 97 A41 3,
Miguel Alvarez.

664
00:47:09,382 --> 00:47:11,671
Convicted February 3rd, '97.

665
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:13,296
Assault with a deadly weapon,

666
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,297
criminal mischief
in the second degree.

667
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:20,935
Sentence: 1 5 years.
Up for parole in two.

668
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:23,892
According to this file,
you're about to be a father.

669
00:47:24,105 --> 00:47:28,649
You've got a girlfriend, Maritza.
She's an inmate of Parker Women's.

670
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,612
Yeah, we got arrested together.

671
00:47:31,822 --> 00:47:33,102
Ain't that sweet?

672
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:36,033
l can arrange for you
to be there for the birth.

673
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:42,325
Carlos, he is a handsome fuck.

674
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,083
Hey, Miguel,
when you fucked Maritza,

675
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:47,121
did you, like, stare at yourself
in the mirror the whole time and shit?

676
00:47:47,295 --> 00:47:49,335
Fuck you, motherfuckers.

677
00:47:49,506 --> 00:47:51,664
- What's up with Keane?
- What about him?

678
00:47:51,883 --> 00:47:54,339
Yo, come on, man.
That pendejo broke Julio's neck.

679
00:47:54,553 --> 00:47:57,257
- All right? Yo, he gotta get done.
- He's in the fucking hole.

680
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,930
So? Yo, Post got to Ortolani
in the hole, right?

681
00:48:01,143 --> 00:48:04,512
Yeah. Wonder how the hell
he did that shit.

682
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:06,355
Carlos, you wanted something?

683
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:07,644
Yeah, man.

684
00:48:07,816 --> 00:48:10,389
- Can we do a little business?
- Always.

685
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,814
All right.
We need to get into Keane's cell.

686
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,866
- So? Why you coming to me?
- l hear things, papa.

687
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:19,785
- The wrong things, papa.
- You're not in tight with the hacks?

688
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:22,491
l don't know what you're talking about.
But even if l did,

689
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,704
l would tell you
things are too crazy right now.

690
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:28,332
Nobody's gonna help
nobody do nothing.

691
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:32,841
Miguel, the hospital just called.
Maritza just went into labour.

692
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:35,885
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

693
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:43,800
All right, go on in.

694
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:22,965
- There he is. That's my boy.
- Congratulations.

695
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:24,801
- Thanks.
- Look at that.

696
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:28,601
- He's beautiful, right?
- Yeah, he must take after his mother.

697
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:32,317
l'd do anything for him, you know.
l'd die for him.

698
00:49:32,484 --> 00:49:35,236
Well, you try and stay alive instead.
Look, l got a message here.

699
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:37,853
You gotta call Maritza right away.

700
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:46,071
Father, ever since
the baby was born,

701
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:49,367
you know, l been bragging
to all the other guys

702
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:53,327
about how beautiful he is
and shit like that.

703
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:55,753
l mean, you really gotta admit,
l mean,

704
00:49:55,924 --> 00:49:58,415
he's the most beautiful baby
in the world.

705
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:05,724
So now l'm thinking that, like,
maybe l went a little overboard

706
00:50:05,976 --> 00:50:08,597
because Maritza called me
this morning talking about

707
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,977
how the baby got a bad liver

708
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:17,808
and he's still in the hospital
and they think that he's gonna die.

709
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:21,897
So now l'm thinking that maybe God
heard me bragging so much

710
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:25,076
and he decided,

711
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:29,909
to, you know, punish me.

712
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,794
Oh, Miguel,
God doesn't work that way.

713
00:50:33,003 --> 00:50:35,494
l mean, growing up, l knew
l was the best-looking in my hood.

714
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:39,171
You know, l told everybody.
You know, l was the best athlete,

715
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:42,385
l was the best lover, you know,
even my fucking car.

716
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:45,762
So now l'm thinking that,
you know, God's pissed off.

717
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:52,051
l'm wondering
if you could talk to God for me

718
00:50:53,732 --> 00:50:56,519
and tell him
that if he saves my baby,

719
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:01,190
you know,
l'll stop being such a bigmouth.

720
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,563
Could you do that for me, Father?

721
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:12,623
l will, but you gotta pray to God, too,
you know?

722
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:16,203
Don't negotiate. You gotta stop
bragging for your own good.

723
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,165
l know that.

724
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:25,303
But if my baby dies, you know,
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

725
00:51:25,722 --> 00:51:28,011
l mean, it's like l'll die.

726
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:34,011
Miguel, you should pray to God
for your son's health,

727
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:37,018
but you should also ask God
to give you and Maritza the strength

728
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:38,686
to face whatever happens.

729
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,478
Maritza says that the doctor says
that all this is going on

730
00:51:42,656 --> 00:51:45,989
because of the drugs that we did
before she was pregnant, you know.

731
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,653
And after she was pregnant,
you know,

732
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:51,113
people were fucking telling us,
you know, not to, you know--

733
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:52,831
And Maritza didn't want to,
you know,

734
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:56,534
and l thought nothing bad
was gonna fucking happen to me.

735
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:01,172
Me.

736
00:52:03,093 --> 00:52:07,007
Pray for me. Pray for my baby.

737
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:11,391
l will.

738
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,143
Repeat after me:

739
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:20,433
O my God, l am heartily sorry

740
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:24,235
for having offended thee,
and l detest all my sins--

741
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:27,822
No, that ain't enough.
That ain't enough.

742
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:33,076
l mean, God wants a piece
of my fucking ass.

743
00:52:39,796 --> 00:52:43,545
We try to figure out what God
wants from us, why he put us here.

744
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:45,502
We try to make deals with him.

745
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:47,835
But God is one tough motherfucker.

746
00:52:48,054 --> 00:52:52,348
And we know to get what we need,
we got to give up what matters most.

747
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,221
Anything less, he's not interested.

748
00:53:37,312 --> 00:53:40,763
Lamb of God,
you take away the sins of the world.

749
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:42,975
Have mercy on us.

750
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:47,404
The body of Christ.

751
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:51,699
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

752
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,533
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

753
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:02,211
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

754
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:15,090
The body of Christ.

755
00:54:15,642 --> 00:54:18,394
God knows he's perfect
and we're not.

756
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:19,766
And we can never be.

757
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:21,397
But he expects us to be.

758
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:24,940
And he punishes us if we're not,
you know what l'm saying?

759
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:27,440
God is the ultimate gangster.

760
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:30,690
The supreme mob boss,
you know what l mean?

761
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:34,110
Making us live by his code.
Deaden us if we don't.

762
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:36,616
Yo, he never has to talk to us
face to face

763
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,243
and he never has to explain exactly
why he does what he does.

764
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,033
Know what l'm saying? Nigger sits up
there in heaven somewhere,

765
00:54:44,254 --> 00:54:47,290
drinking a cappuccino, chilling.

766
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:52,335
Got the whole world in his hands

767
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:58,889
He got the whole world by the balls.
ln excelsis Deo and all that shit.
