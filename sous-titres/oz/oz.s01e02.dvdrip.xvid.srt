1
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,691
''Fuck'' is a four-letter word.

2
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:41,689
''Rape'' is a four-letter word.

3
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:44,657
''Wife'' is a four-letter word.

4
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:46,195
So is ''love.''

5
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,616
''Fuck'' is a curse.

6
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,821
So is ''love.''

7
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:53,702
And l don't just mean
boys and girls.

8
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,743
l'm talking friends, l'm talking family.

9
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,200
Somebody wanna tell me what
the fuck happened to Dino Ortolani?

10
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,616
Well, he suffocated an AlDS patient,
Emilio Sanchez,

11
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:31,950
and l put him in the hole.

12
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,865
- l heard you had him sedated.
- You what?

13
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,533
Dr. Nathan put him on 4 milligrams
of lorazepam. He was violent.

14
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:41,126
Since when is it prison policy
to drug inmates?

15
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,834
What the fuck difference
does it make?

16
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:44,716
Your boys had already
beaten him senseless.

17
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:48,011
The question is,
who set him on fire?

18
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:51,721
Maybe the Latinos did it,
to get Dino for killing Sanchez.

19
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,968
Everybody had a reason
to hate Ortolani.

20
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,810
The Homies,
the Muslims, the Aryans.

21
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,594
- Everybody wanted to smoke him.
- Yeah, including you.

22
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,891
Me? Me personally?

23
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:02,307
You or some other officer.

24
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,233
Somebody let
whoever lit the match into the hole.

25
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:07,238
- Fuck you, McManus.
- Yeah, fuck me.

26
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,022
Hey, guys, the enemy's out there.

27
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,241
Lenny, l want you
to head up the investigation.

28
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:16,283
Question everyone.

29
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,450
Find out who killed Ortolani
before Nino Schibetta does,

30
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,043
before the governor sends
in the Feds.

31
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:25,794
Before we have a full-scale riot
on our hands.

32
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,585
Niggers did Ortolani.

33
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,298
You got any evidence to prove that?

34
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,340
Yeah, right,
like you guys ever need evidence.

35
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:35,347
You hear one of them
admit to killing him?

36
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,309
No, but think about it.

37
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:40,898
Who else is there?

38
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,433
- Latinos?
- No.

39
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:46,273
Burning isn't the spics' style.

40
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,816
Niggers burn things.

41
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,566
- You could've done Ortolani.
- Yeah, sure.

42
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:54,490
There's no valentines
between me and Dino.

43
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:57,322
But when l kill a man,

44
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,538
it's because he's standing in the way
of my constitutional rights.

45
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,994
l kill to protect what's mine.

46
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:08,128
What God has given me.

47
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:11,554
The Sicilians understand that.

48
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,847
The rest of these fucks
would cut a man for a pair of sneakers

49
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:17,264
or a fucking cigarette.

50
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,103
They are animals.

51
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:22,847
Get up. l said, break it up.
Break it up.

52
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,685
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Break it up!

53
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,604
- This is my--
- Get the fuck out of here.

54
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,531
You stupid or what?
Want some of this?

55
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,033
He hasn't come out in days?

56
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,286
Not for dinner,
not for lunch, not for a shower.

57
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,341
Beecher.

58
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:54,965
What's up? ls he sick?

59
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:59,014
- Get lost for a minute, okay?
- Sure.

60
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:01,303
Hope you feel better, buddy.

61
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,765
Your ass belongs to me.

62
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:10,773
So you've been keeping
pretty much to yourself lately.

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,945
Prison is a rough adjustment
for anyone, but a man like you--

64
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:21,698
- They burned Ortolani.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:25,003
He was tough, strong.
lf a guy like that isn't safe--

66
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:28,213
Beecher, l could tell you you're safe,

67
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:30,712
but that would be a lie.

68
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,343
You gotta be careful,

69
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:35,297
respectful.

70
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:39,677
You gotta try to focus on the day
you're getting released.

71
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:42,598
You're married, right? You got kids?

72
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,022
Your family been to visit you lately?

73
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:49,815
l haven't seen Genevieve since
sentencing. lt was about a month ago.

74
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,693
The kids, it's even longer.

75
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:56,196
Call your wife, ask her to come.

76
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,197
The first time alone,
let her get a sense of the place.

77
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,701
Make a romantic evening of it,
just the two of you.

78
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:05,616
Romantic? Here? How?

79
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:07,627
Go see Sister Pete.

80
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,629
Here we are.

81
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,130
Tobias Beecher.
Oh, good, you're married.

82
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:18,429
A lot of fellas in here try to bring
their girlfriends in as wives.

83
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:19,630
lt's no dice.

84
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,637
Once in a while, one of these guys,
who is married,

85
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:27,598
tries to pull off a fast one on me
and pass off a hooker as his mate.

86
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:30,900
They do that once.
They don't do it again.

87
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:34,895
You know, the whole point
of a conjugal is not just sex.

88
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,440
But it's, your wife comes in,
she brings food,

89
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,577
she can cook for you,
you talk to each other.

90
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:44,867
You're together again, you know?

91
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:49,370
Okay,

92
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:53,874
fill in this form
and l'll handle the rest.

93
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,254
Where you been, sweet pea?

94
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,141
To see Sister Peter Marie.

95
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:04,802
Went to the shrink?

96
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,807
What, about those nightmares
you been having?

97
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:13,018
- To arrange a visit with my wife.
- Oh, a conjugal.

98
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,357
You didn't ask my permission.

99
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:21,364
When are you gonna learn, prag?

100
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:23,202
You belong to me.

101
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:26,616
l make all your decisions, right?

102
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:30,830
So ask me.

103
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,623
Come over here and ask me
if you can fuck your wife.

104
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,921
- l--
- Come on, ask me. Now.

105
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,465
Can l be with my wife?

106
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:46,805
''Fuck my wife.''

107
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,143
- Fuck my wife.
- Louder, and say ''please'' and ''sir''.

108
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:57,523
Please, sir,

109
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:59,774
may l fuck my wife?

110
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,944
Louder.

111
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,781
Please, sir, may l fuck my wife?!

112
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,790
See, when you ask me like that,

113
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,203
l can't deny you anything.

114
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,593
l am here to see my--

115
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,223
Tobias Beecher.

116
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,101
- B-E-A--
- B-E-E-C-H-E-R.

117
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:38,604
Okay. Let me see the basket
and your purse.

118
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,488
They said that l could bring food.

119
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:43,326
Yeah. Step right through here,
please.

120
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:51,114
Are you transporting any drugs,
weapons, explosives, alcohol?

121
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,374
No.

122
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,123
Sign this.

123
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,127
Right here.

124
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:04,549
lf l was carrying explosives,
why would l say yes?

125
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:08,216
Lady, l don't know.
The state says l have to ask, l ask.

126
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:12,768
Purse goes in the locker.

127
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:22,857
When you're finished there,
go to room one right here.

128
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:34,287
Hi.

129
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,339
Hi.

130
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:57,232
l've missed you so much.

131
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:04,573
Holly made a painting for you
but l left it in my purse.

132
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,360
The guard asked me
about explosives

133
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:08,284
and l completely forgot
about the painting.

134
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:09,484
lt's of our house.

135
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:13,156
Holly and Gary are standing out front
and l'm holding the baby.

136
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,704
She drew the dog
about twice as big as anybody else.

137
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:22,296
You're not in it.

138
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,585
You're not in the painting.

139
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:42,273
l thought l'd make spaghetti.

140
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,981
Please,

141
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,606
honey, just hold me.

142
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:50,577
Please.

143
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,040
Let's go! Move it, Beecher!

144
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:01,001
Lorenzo, move it.

145
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:02,625
Stay right there.

146
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:05,711
Let's go, Beecher, come on.
Double time.

147
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:26,737
Hello there.

148
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,822
- What's this?
- Fuck is this shit, man?

149
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:50,553
Hey, young lady.

150
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,549
- Me?
- No. You. Come with me.

151
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,433
We're gonna detain you
a couple of minutes.

152
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:57,476
Put your hands palms down
on the counter.

153
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,473
What's your name?

154
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,852
That's some goddamn nerve...

155
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,029
How was it?

156
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:16,486
Good.

157
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:20,626
''Good''?

158
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,627
You come from a night of wild sex
with the only woman you love

159
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,591
and you tell me it was good?

160
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:33,630
You got a lovely family.

161
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,091
l'm amazed you haven't shown me
these pictures before.

162
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,971
Amazed and a little hurt.

163
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:49,362
l hope you don't mind me finding these
hidden underneath your mattress.

164
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:52,692
Beautiful.

165
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,826
My wife is dead.

166
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,739
l got two sons.

167
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:03,660
Seventeen and 1 6.

168
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:07,828
Handsome fucking kids too.
Good Aryan stock, you know?

169
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,541
My sons are devoted to me.

170
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:17,640
l'm an icon to them because
l went to prison for my beliefs.

171
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:21,394
They would do anything
l ask them to.

172
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,932
Steal, maim,

173
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:26,894
kill.

174
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,192
Maybe l should have them
go visit your family, huh?

175
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:38,156
Just a little friendly call,
what do you think?

176
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:41,453
My sons and your wife.

177
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:45,960
My sons and your daughter.

178
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,235
Bitch, herm, Maytag, shim.

179
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,860
Here in Oz we call them ''prags. ''

180
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,283
l don't know where it comes from,
but you make a man your prag,

181
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,291
he's your prag for life.

182
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:28,372
lt's like the old days
when people didn't get divorced,

183
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,964
the only way out of
marriage is death.

184
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:34,969
Till death do us part.

185
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,052
Donald Groves.

186
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,721
You killed your parents
and ate them, right?

187
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:44,141
l only ate my mom.

188
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:46,762
l was saving my dad
for Thanksgiving.

189
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:48,939
That's festive.

190
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:53,151
So, what can you tell me
about Dino Ortolani's murder?

191
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:56,361
l got in trouble for sneaking
into the morgue.

192
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,733
What were you doing
in the morgue?

193
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:01,487
l was just looking.

194
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:05,200
- And they put you in the hole.
- Yeah.

195
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,371
And you were in the cell
next to Ortolani's when he got burned.

196
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,211
Yeah.

197
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:11,999
You hear anything?

198
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:15,258
No. Not a sound.

199
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:18,546
He didn't scream.

200
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:22,641
He gets set on fire
but he doesn't scream.

201
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:26,596
That's balls.

202
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,604
Anything else?

203
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,440
l saw them carry him out.

204
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:39,115
Looked like a roasted,
broiled chicken.

205
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:42,453
His flesh was all brown and crispy.

206
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,204
He looked good enough to eat.

207
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,224
- What's he saying?
- He's talking about how taxpayers

208
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:16,112
shouldn't have to foot the bill
for prisoner frills.

209
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,148
Thank you, Governor Cocksucker.

210
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:21,366
Therefore, l am introducing
to the legislature

211
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:23,368
a measure which would
save this state

212
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:26,870
an estimated $3 million a year.

213
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:28,825
This law would eliminate

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,001
all conjugal visits
between inmates and their wives.

215
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,543
- Get the fuck out of here.
- l'm gonna see McManus.

216
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:36,873
The son of a bitch.

217
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:39,084
This is bullshit, man.

218
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,805
Okay, guys, listen.

219
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:48,390
Hey, stop talking.
lf you don't stop talking fast,

220
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:51,978
l'm gonna hang up
my ''out to lunch'' sign, all right?

221
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,191
Get-- Get in line.

222
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,276
All right, now, thank you.

223
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,025
Pass this on to the fella
in back of you,

224
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,194
take the pencil
and start filling out the forms.

225
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,576
l have counted all the pencils
and l want them back.

226
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:09,955
So if you use any of them as a weapon
or if any one of them is missing,

227
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,958
none of you will get a visit.

228
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,995
ls that understood?
Am l making myself clear?

229
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,964
Because if not, l will repeat myself.

230
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:22,667
Yes.

231
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,803
That's right.

232
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,764
Yes.

233
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,521
Yes.

234
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:25,779
Freeze!

235
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:32,122
- Freeze!
- l got him.

236
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,291
Shit. Fuck.

237
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:44,259
- He's dead.
- You got it, man.

238
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,975
No! No!

239
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:54,387
- Don't--
- Jump.

240
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,738
Prisoner number 95H522,
Augustus Hill.

241
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,029
Convicted November 6th, '95.

242
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,403

00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,405
Sentence: life imprisonment.

Up for parole in 20 years.

245
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,499
l don't believe this shit.

246
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:20,037
Word. Fiending to see my wife.

247
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:24,292
- Least you get to see yours, huh?
- What you mean?

248
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:26,422
Funky back.

249
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:29,587
What, you think because
l can't walk l can't fuck?

250
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:34,516
- So you can fuck?
- Yeah.

251
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:39,395
Wait. Are we talking getting hard
or licky-licky?

252
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:43,142
Nigga, we talking in and out,
up and down.

253
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:47,566
l never thought a nigga
could get hard in a wheelchair.

254
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,989
Yeah, well, it's easier
for some of us than others.

255
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:51,530
Some people gotta use a pump,

256
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:54,948
some niggas gotta use drugs,
get a needle stuck in their dick.

257
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,786
Yo, the worst one is implants.

258
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,619
They slice your dick open

259
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:03,170
and they lay in this kind of like
a steel rod to keep the shit stiff.

260
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:05,789
Oh, please.

261
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,761
Yeah, but l get hard
the old-fashioned way.

262
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:12,296
Only problem is l don't know it.

263
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,136
You don't know what?

264
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:17,558
l don't know when l'm hard.

265
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,434
You don't know when you're hard?

266
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,734
l got no sensation down there
so l don't know when l'm hard,

267
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,400
l don't know when l come.
My wife gotta tell me.

268
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:29,274
You don't know when you're hard?

269
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:31,489
You don't know if you've come?

270
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,905
You don't get
any pleasure at all, huh?

271
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:39,494
- What the fuck are you doing it for?
- For her.

272
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:44,750
You can take a lot of things
away from a man.

273
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:46,838
Cigarettes, the gym.

274
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,633
You can take his freedom, his legs,

275
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:53,381
but not his feelings.

276
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,925
Not his feelings.

277
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,433
That's it. There you go.

278
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,514
Pull, pull. Like that.

279
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:06,104
A man loves a woman.

280
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,653
No matter what kind of man he is,
if he loves her, he wants her.

281
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:13,316
He wants her body.
He wants her to want his.

282
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,278
So you say to him,
''You can never make love again.

283
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:21,791
You will never touch her
in that way again.

284
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:24,709
This is the last time.

285
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:27,373
The last time.

286
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:29,299
Forever. ''

287
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:34,512
lf that's not cruel
and unusual punishment...

288
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,924
...l don't know what is.

289
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,230
l'm investigating
the murder of Dino Ortolani.

290
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,480
Lucky me, right?

291
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:48,776
He used to supervise you
in the kitchen?

292
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:50,315
Yeah.

293
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:53,901
- You have any run-ins with him?
- No.

294
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:57,201
No? He's ordering you around
all day:

295
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:01,119
''Boy, do this. Boy, do that.''
lt never pissed you off?

296
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,076
He never called me ''boy''.

297
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:05,369
He put your little brother
Billie in the hospital.

298
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,295
He beat him nearly to death.

299
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:10,418
Ortolani was a scumfuck, man.

300
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:22,433
You married, Jefferson?

301
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:25,350
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Answer the question.

302
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,517
No, l ain't married.

303
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:29,561
You got a girl waiting for you
on the outside?

304
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:31,058
Yeah.

305
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,438
She know
you're a lying sack of shit?

306
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,276
lf l find out
you had anything to do with this,

307
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,072
l'm gonna bury you
so deep in Gen Pop,

308
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,204
she'll never see
your black ass again.

309
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,209
So, what do l say
when they call me in?

310
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,461
You say nothing, Johnny. Nothing.

311
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:50,881
Listen up.

312
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,130
l'll be running the kitchen
from now on, okay?

313
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:55,300
Everything's gonna be the same.

314
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:57,090
Until we find out who whacked Dino,

315
00:22:57,264 --> 00:23:00,763
we ain't selling any contraband
to anyone for any reason. Okay?

316
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:04,803
l'll set that wop motherfucker
on fire next.

317
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,512
- Shut the fuck up.
- l ain't afraid of no fucking greaseball.

318
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:09,690
Shut the fuck up.

319
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,962
Jefferson.

320
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,468
Cops wanna see me about Ortolani.

321
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,758
What's up?

322
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:41,966
l'm having a visit with Mavis.

323
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:44,888
- What?
- My girl, Mavis.

324
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:48,223
l called her, told her
l been missing her.

325
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,643
She said she wants
to stand outside.

326
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,936
Holy fuck.

327
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:56,645
Told her l'd been missing her body.

328
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:02,280
Oh, shit. Jefferson, you the shit.

329
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:53,877
Prisoner number 97K1 86,

330
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,212
Jefferson Keane.

331
00:24:56,424 --> 00:24:58,880
Convicted May 1 4th, '97.

332
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:01,715
Two counts murder
in the first degree.

333
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,719
Sentence: life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.

334
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,931
l wanna get married.

335
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:12,725
To anyone in particular?

336
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:15,349
Yeah, my girl Mavis.

337
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,600
Mavis wants to marry you

338
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:19,234
in spite of the fact
that you're gonna be in here for life?

339
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:21,066
Yeah.

340
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:23,026
Sounds like a remarkable woman.

341
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:25,282
She is.

342
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:27,829
All right.

343
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:30,040
l'll make the arrangements.

344
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,788
- No, absolutely not.
- Why?

345
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:35,838
This is a prison, McManus,
not the Elvis Chapel.

346
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:38,420
Besides, we've got enough shit
going on right now as it is.

347
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:40,501
A wedding might help
ease some of the tension.

348
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:43,091
lt might also be perceived as a reward
for Jefferson Keane

349
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:46,970
who, as far as l can tell,
has done nothing to deserve a reward.

350
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:50,475
He's not a model prisoner, no,
but this could help turn him around.

351
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:52,555
The guy killed a couple
on their wedding day,

352
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:54,682
shot them both down in cold blood.

353
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,939
He says the two of them
ripped off his package.

354
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:59,061
- And that justifies it?
- No, it explains it.

355
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,146
You'd be okay with this if he'd waited
to kill them till after their honeymoon?

356
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:04,909
- Yeah.
- Leo--

357
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,194
Hey, l believe
in the sanctity of marriage.

358
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,613
lt's a holy ritual, a sacred bond
between a man, a woman and God.

359
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,827
Marriage is when a husband
and wife live together,

360
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:17,536
in the same house,
sleep in the same bed.

361
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,879
Jefferson Keane
and whatever her name is--

362
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:22,298
- Mavis.
- They can't do that.

363
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:25,084
The marriage would be a fraud,
l'm not gonna be a party to it.

364
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:28,804
Well, Keane lives in Em City.
lt's my decision.

365
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:32,094
That's true.

366
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:34,850
But the lobby
is under my jurisdiction

367
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:39,109
and you try and bring in
that bride-to-be through the front door.

368
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,644
They don't have a clue
what went down with Ortolani,

369
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:43,820
so just chill the fuck out.

370
00:26:44,032 --> 00:26:47,567
But what about the Wiseguys?
They stopped everything.

371
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,822
No more drugs, no more bets,
no more contraband.

372
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,119
Ain't nothing moving in any direction
until Nino Schibetta gets satisfaction.

373
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:56,960
Jefferson.

374
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:03,131
- l spoke to the warden.
- Yeah?

375
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:05,916
l'm sorry. He's not gonna give you
permission to get married.

376
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:08,344
This is not to say
that he's not gonna change his mind,

377
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:11,385
but l think for now, we have to
put this thing on the backburner.

378
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,888
- We can't.
- Why?

379
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:14,224
Because l'm gonna lose her.

380
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:16,848
Well, if she loves you
as much as you say--

381
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:18,892
You promised me, McManus.

382
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,351
Now you're going back
on your fucking word.

383
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,654
A man who can't keep his word
ain't shit with me.

384
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:26,407
He ain't shit.

385
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:29,653
You know, l really appreciate
that you've come to me.

386
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:34,788
- lt's just that l love her so much.
- l'm sure you do.

387
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,660
But, you know,
your desire to marry her,

388
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:41,417
that can't come out of your ego.

389
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:44,545
lt can't come out of a jealousy,
it can't come out of a fear

390
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,001
that because you are in here
and you can't have her,

391
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,005
no man should.

392
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,056
lf you love her, you must be careful

393
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:56,055
that you do not deprive her
of the fullness of life.

394
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:58,940
No, man, l wouldn't do that to her.

395
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:01,100
Okay.

396
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:03,396
Okay.

397
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:08,446
Now, you've told me
why you love Mavis, right?

398
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:11,825
Now you explain to me
how you know she loves you.

399
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:13,870
lt's the little things.

400
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,247
lt's like at my trial,
she was there every day.

401
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:21,291
l mean, just seeing her made
everything so much easier for me.

402
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:25,716
And her face,
l mean, her smile, it's like--

403
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:28,799
Hell, l ain't got the words like you.

404
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:31,170
That's why l want you
to plead my case for me.

405
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:33,049
l'll get you anything
you want up in here.

406
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:36,801
- You have nothing l need.
- So what's that, a no?

407
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:42,267
l believe that you love each other.

408
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:47,445
But you've gotta take that love, brother,
and you gotta trust in the will of Allah.

409
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,364
Yo, my girl is pregnant.

410
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:52,990
l screwed her,
now Allah's screwing me.

411
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:14,421
- Well?
- lt's about Keane.

412
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,841
There's a piece of information
l don't think you have.

413
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:21,851
l decided to let Jefferson Keane
get married.

414
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:25,309
- Because?
- Kareem Said came to see me.

415
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:27,769
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

416
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:30,898
l come to you on Keane's behalf,

417
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:32,943
you blow me off
in a cloud of platitudes.

418
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,909
Now, Kareem Said says
God knows what to you,

419
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:37,035
the clouds have parted,
the sun is shining.

420
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:40,533
Do you realize how this damages
my credibility with the inmates?

421
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,369
So then what? l shouldn't let him get
married for the sake of your credibility?

422
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:47,203
- That's right.
- McManus,

423
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:52,050
how often does a guy like Said
come to see us to ask for a favour?

424
00:29:52,262 --> 00:29:54,338
- Oh, l get it. So now he owes you.
- Yeah.

425
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:56,549
He's gonna help contain
the Ortolani situation,

426
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,177
he's gonna help
slow down the drugs.

427
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:00,053
Which means nothing.

428
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,393
Why didn't you tell me

429
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:06,056
that Jefferson Keane's girlfriend
was pregnant?

430
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:11,687
Because l didn't know.
He didn't tell me that.

431
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:14,568
So much for your credibility.

432
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,861
Man, this is some bullshit.

433
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:20,323
Jefferson, the warden
was very specific

434
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,165
about how this is going to work.

435
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,119
So what's this proxy shit?

436
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:25,664
While you'll be here,

437
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:30,457
and your fiancee
will be at your local Baptist church,

438
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:33,166
you'll both be exchanging vows
at the same time

439
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:35,712
and each of you will have

440
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:38,338
someone standing in
for the other person.

441
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:43,092
Come on, Father,
don't this seem fucked up to you?

442
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:56,566
Do you, Jefferson Keane,
take Mavis Woodson to be your wife?

443
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,113
l do.

444
00:30:58,995 --> 00:31:04,416
Do you, Mavis Woodson, take
Jefferson Keane to be your husband?

445
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:10,165
Yes. Fuck off.

446
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:17,342
With the power vested in me,
l pronounce you husband and wife.

447
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,014
You not gonna kiss the bride?

448
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:25,600
Kiss my ass.

449
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:27,975
Congratulations, man.

450
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,107
For better, for worse.

451
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:33,189
Shit, it don't get much worse
than this.

452
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:35,065
Yo, man,

453
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,737
got a letter from Mavis.

454
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:01,845
lt's the will of Allah, brother.

455
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:11,226
What are you doing tonight?

456
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:16,686
Well, l was thinking maybe you'd
come over to my house for dinner.

457
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,398
So you sleep here
at the prison sometimes?

458
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:21,491
Believe me, l don't wanna.

459
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:24,241
l've been doing double shifts
and l live two hours away,

460
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:26,870
so by the time l get home
l gotta turn around and come back.

461
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:28,073
So move closer.

462
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:30,369
lf l could afford to,
l wouldn't do double shifts.

463
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:34,585
Appreciate it, Leo. l can't.

464
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,125
Too much work to do, right?

465
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,220
You can take a break
from saving the world.

466
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:41,799
Even Jesus had supper.

467
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:45,716
Yeah, and right afterwards
he was betrayed and crucified.

468
00:32:45,936 --> 00:32:47,679
l'll try not to take that personally.

469
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:50,019
You got a daughter, if l remember.

470
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,645
How does she feel
about you being gone for days on end?

471
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:54,318
Please.

472
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,401
We live with my mother.
Between the two of them

473
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:59,282
l get the crap beat out of me
every time l walk through the door.

474
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:03,109
- Come on, get your coat.
- l can't. l have a date.

475
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:08,370
- A date?
- Yep. ls that so hard to believe?

476
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,659
Frankly, yes.

477
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:13,084
l got a dick like every other guy.

478
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:14,791
You need to find a job
closer to home.

479
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:17,213
What, l haven't looked?
There are no jobs.

480
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:20,510
You think if the Chevy plant was hiring
l would choose to come here

481
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,089
and babysit these pisspots?
l have no choice.

482
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:27,842
Just like these inmates. Trapped.

483
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:31,929
- McManus, get a wife.
- l had a wife.

484
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,232
From what l hear,
you had a nightmare.

485
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,269
You been checking up on me?

486
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:40,445
- Dinner, tomorrow.
- Yeah, you bet.

487
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:46,243
Have a nice date.

488
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:03,011
God made sunsets full of colour

489
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:06,306
and God made racehorses
that run in a flash.

490
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:09,470
God made the orange,
the apple and strawberries.

491
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:13,137
But God's greatest creation
is pussy.

492
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:14,899
l don't mean to be crude or nothing,

493
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,352
but you can have all the sunsets,
horses, and fruit there is,

494
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,402
just give me
all the pussy in the world.

495
00:34:20,614 --> 00:34:26,200
Fuck, l don't need all the pussy.
Just one a day, every day.

496
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:37,915
Go! Go!

497
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:39,958
Miguel Alvarez.

498
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,044
l'm Father Ray Mukada.

499
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,507
l'm one of the prison chaplains.

500
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,257
No shit.

501
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:49,142
According to this file,
you're about to be a father.

502
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:53,722
You've got a girlfriend, Maritza,
she's an inmate at Parker Women's.

503
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:57,806
Yeah, we got arrested together.
Ain't that sweet?

504
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:01,145
l can arrange for you
to be there for the birth.

505
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:03,355
l don't give a shit about shit like that.

506
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,780
Miguel, you'll probably be paroled
in two years.

507
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:08,157
When you get out,
you'll wanna be a father to your kid.

508
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,912
ls that right?

509
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:13,993
Man, that's my father.

510
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,038
You know, and up in some cellblock
somewhere is my grandfather, man,

511
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:18,836
so don't be giving me
none of this shit.

512
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,376
l get it.

513
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,081
You had a miserable childhood.
Tough.

514
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,630
But let me tell you something.

515
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:28,130
You're still responsible
for bringing a new life into this world.

516
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:30,424
You are responsible.

517
00:35:30,642 --> 00:35:33,976
The same way that l'm responsible
for you, for your soul.

518
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:37,272
So get ready, Miguel Alvarez, because
l'm gonna be over your shoulder.

519
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:46,360
Hey, Ray, you wanted to know,

520
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,736
l just signed the papers
transferring Miguel Alvarez to Em City.

521
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:51,655
Miguel Alvarez.

522
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:55,490
Another shining example
of how well the penal system works.

523
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,496
A guy walks in the front door
and he gets stabbed in the chest,

524
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,920
not to mention the fact that his father
and grandfather are both inmates here.

525
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:03,330
Yeah, l know.

526
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:06,960
You know, maybe l should
talk to them both about Miguel.

527
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:08,554
The kid's about to become a father

528
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:10,637
and he refuses to accept
responsibility for it.

529
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:14,308
Well, the granddad,

530
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,808
Ricardo Alvarez, is in solitary.

531
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:21,482
And having a conversation
with the father, Eduardo,

532
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,812
- it's gonna be tough.
- Why?

533
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,734
He's belligerent?

534
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:29,200
He has no tongue.

535
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:56,678
Senor Alvarez?
l'm Ray Mukada, l'm the--

536
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,934
l know who you are.

537
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:03,856
l'd like to speak with you
about your grandson, Miguel.

538
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,188
What about him?

539
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,361
He's an inmate here now.

540
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:11,908
l heard.

541
00:37:12,536 --> 00:37:15,702
Well, then, maybe you also heard
that he's about to become a father.

542
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:20,327
His girlfriend, who he was arrested
with, is at Parker Women's.

543
00:37:22,254 --> 00:37:23,582
- And?
- l'm trying to get Miguel

544
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:27,248
to accept the responsibility
for raising the child.

545
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:29,421
Maybe you can help me?

546
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,920
Because l'm his grandfather?

547
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:34,929
Padre,

548
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:38,007
l never even seen him.

549
00:37:40,147 --> 00:37:43,183
You were a shitty father,
your son was a shitty father.

550
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,807
Don't you think it's time
we break the pattern?

551
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:49,147
l was 1 8 when l was convicted.

552
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:51,856
Eduardo was a baby.

553
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:57,743
Next time l saw him, he was 1 8

554
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,910
and wearing
the same prison uniform l was.

555
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:07,045
Then my son started
mouthing off everybody here,

556
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:10,965
making fun of people,
making threats.

557
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:14,507
And he started poking around
with a Haitian.

558
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:18,851
And one night-- One night,
while Eduardo was sleeping,

559
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:23,387
the Haitian cut his tongue out.

560
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:26,180
Yes, sir, l know. l read the report.

561
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:30,352
So you found the Haitian
and you cut his heart out.

562
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,024
Yeah.

563
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:34,439
So, what you're telling me

564
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:37,572
is that you were being a good father
to Eduardo

565
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:40,457
when you carved up the Haitian.

566
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,621
Well, if somebody hurts
your grandson

567
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:48,209
you won't be able to do anything
about it, will you?

568
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:50,332
At least not that way.

569
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,343
All l'm asking you is to talk to the boy,
not for you, not for him,

570
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:58,758
but for the baby
that's about to be born.

571
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:02,938
Your great-grandchild.

572
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,245
What the fuck?

573
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,079
Come here.

574
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:35,838
Who the fuck are you?

575
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,085
Come here!

576
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:51,235
Okay,

577
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:54,237
l'm here.

578
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:57,904
Now what?

579
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:13,708
You know who l am, don't you?

580
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:19,256
Yeah.

581
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,140
Sex is a mindfuck.

582
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:32,603
A wad of jizz hits an egg and...
you're connected to all these people.

583
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:36,105
These strangers, who maybe
got the same eyes as you

584
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:37,733
the same sort of nose.

585
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:41,568
Or maybe they passed you some cell
that makes you drink or do drugs,

586
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:44,823
even if you don't wanna.
Even if it's killing you.

587
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,875
These gene things are like
the shackles they put on us here,

588
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:50,872
the chains to keep us
from moving freely.

589
00:40:51,087 --> 00:40:52,961
You gotta be Houdini
to get out of them.

590
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:56,043
You gotta be fucking Houdini.

591
00:41:18,323 --> 00:41:20,814
Ortolani committed suicide.

592
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,825
Suicide?

593
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:26,487
How can he be tied down
with restraints and set himself on fire?

594
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:31,036
- That's impossible.
- Even so, he committed suicide.

595
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:34,088
- What makes you say that?
- God told me.

596
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:35,626
God told you?

597
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:37,922
God comes to visit me
every once in a while.

598
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:41,753
Actually, he comes more often
than l'd like, but he's God.

599
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:46,183
What can l say? That l'm busy,
that l'm in the shower? He knows.

600
00:41:47,018 --> 00:41:48,513
We talking about
a burning bush here?

601
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:51,136
No. lt's more like a strobe.

602
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:54,191
A little too flashy,
a little cheesy for my taste.

603
00:41:55,152 --> 00:41:57,559
And God told you
Ortolani committed suicide?

604
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:01,440
Well, that the kid wanted to die,
and consciously or un,

605
00:42:01,658 --> 00:42:04,231
he set up the circumstances
where he'd be killed.

606
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:06,700
God happen to tell you who did it?

607
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:09,285
- No.
- l didn't think so.

608
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:13,960
But he told me to tell you to tell
Nino Schibetta not to seek revenge.

609
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:16,377
Why didn't you tell Schibetta?

610
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,634
Just because l talk to God
doesn't mean l'm crazy.

611
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:22,338
How's your mother?

612
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:25,471
Not good, Papa, not good at all.

613
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,551
Doctor says she ain't got long.

614
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,844
Who is this doctor?

615
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:34,514
This specialist. The best.

616
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,816
- ls he Jewish?
- l don't know.

617
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:41,650
His name's Dr. Bidner.
Dr. Russo recommended him.

618
00:42:41,865 --> 00:42:43,324
Get a Jew.

619
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:49,991
Don't.

620
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,462
Okay.

621
00:42:57,547 --> 00:42:59,339
What else?

622
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:03,885
Dino's funeral's tomorrow,
you know.

623
00:43:05,597 --> 00:43:08,170
How are his parents taking it?

624
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:12,643
How do you think?

625
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:20,027
Paolo is philosophical
and Maria wants revenge.

626
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,608
- Yeah.
- Tell her she's got it.

627
00:43:27,202 --> 00:43:28,862
Okay.

628
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,787
Come on, Nino. You know the drill.

629
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:10,233
--three females and one male.

630
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:25,959
Prisoner number 95S604,
Nino Schibetta.

631
00:44:26,178 --> 00:44:28,503
Convicted December 1 2th, '95.

632
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,432
Two counts conspiracy
to commit murder.

633
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:37,265
Sentence: 1 20 years.
Up for parole in 70.

634
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:40,150
l'm gonna arrange for you
to visit your wife in the hospital.

635
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,689
That's very considerate of you.

636
00:44:45,906 --> 00:44:48,313
But forgive me,
l'm cynical by nature.

637
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,193
Why are you being
so considerate to me?

638
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:55,153
lt's hard enough her being this ill
without you being able to--

639
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,285
Say goodbye?

640
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:02,336
What do you want from me?

641
00:45:02,547 --> 00:45:04,207
Your continued patience.

642
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:05,918
You're gonna find out
who killed Dino?

643
00:45:06,134 --> 00:45:08,839
- Yes.
- And you're gonna bring him to justice.

644
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:12,637
- Now you're laughing at me.
- As l said, l'm a cynical bastard.

645
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:15,970
- No one wants a riot.
- True.

646
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:21,433
l would like to see my wife.

647
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,394
Then we have a deal.

648
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:29,280
No.

649
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:57,891
Look, l know you're supposed
to be my sponsor and all that shit,

650
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:02,231
show me the ropes,
but l don't need any help. All right?

651
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:06,601
- O'Reily. That's lrish, right?
- Yeah, you got a problem with that?

652
00:46:07,946 --> 00:46:12,026
- l run the Aryan Brotherhood.
- Yeah, you're doing a hell of a job.

653
00:46:12,242 --> 00:46:14,863
When we heard somebody
was transferring in from the Gen Pop,

654
00:46:15,078 --> 00:46:19,290
we all got kind of curious
because it doesn't happen that often.

655
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,659
Saw you being all palsy
with that hack.

656
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:23,668
Yeah, l'm much loved.

657
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:26,506
Yeah, you got friends.

658
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,957
You got another friend if you want.

659
00:46:32,095 --> 00:46:33,424
See you.

660
00:46:34,347 --> 00:46:38,345
Hey, by the way,
whose cell was this beforehand?

661
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:40,642
Dino Ortolani's.

662
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:10,044
Mr. Schibetta
requests your company.

663
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:32,479
Thank you for coming.

664
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:36,693
Sit.

665
00:47:46,837 --> 00:47:50,537
Dino Ortolani's death
has upset me very deeply.

666
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:57,298
l am obviously hoping
to learn who killed him,

667
00:47:57,514 --> 00:47:59,756
especially in such
a hideous fashion.

668
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:01,385
Does he gotta be in here?

669
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:03,637
Joey.

670
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:11,610
l know there was bad blood
between you and Dino.

671
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,611
- l didn't burn him.
- l'm not accusing.

672
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:17,736
l'm extending my hand.
Dino is dead.

673
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,532
Nothing can change that.

674
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:26,701
But if you could see a way
to help us find his murderer,

675
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:29,160
l would show you my appreciation,

676
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:33,420
my forgiveness
for your past indiscretions.

677
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:36,587
Honestly, l don't know
who offed Dino.

678
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,096
And with no disrespect,
l can't say l'm unhappy about it.

679
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:44,882
But your friendship
would mean a lot to me.

680
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:47,890
So if l hear anything,
l'll come to you first.

681
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:50,348
That's all l ask.

682
00:49:01,953 --> 00:49:03,827
He knows.

683
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:07,453
Schibetta ain't gonna rest
till he knows who done it.

684
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:10,419
You wanna be around when
he finds out you were involved?

685
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,870
- We gotta give him Johnny Post.
- Fuck that.

686
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:15,841
We give him Post, it all goes away.

687
00:49:16,051 --> 00:49:20,001
Maybe you micks work like that,
but l would never rat on a brother.

688
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:25,343
- What do you say we do, huh?
- Chill. Till it fades.

689
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,973
Sicilians don't forget.
Sicilians don't let things fade.

690
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,233
O'Reily's awfully chummy
with the melanzane.

691
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:44,120
- Could mean nothing.
- You wanna talk to Keane?

692
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:45,788
Not yet.

693
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:47,990
Get word to Burrano.

694
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:51,908
He should bring O'Reily in
for a little fishing trip.

695
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:53,706
- She's a hooker.
- You're full of shit.

696
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:55,582
She's a hooker.
l tell you, l been there.

697
00:49:55,799 --> 00:49:57,127
You're shitting me about this.

698
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:01,043
The St. Pauli sector of Hamburg,
Germany is the red-light district.

699
00:50:01,263 --> 00:50:05,130
So you tell me what a St. Pauli girl
does after she takes off her apron.

700
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,845
And l always thought
the little bitch was smiling just for me.

701
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:12,305
- You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

702
00:50:13,024 --> 00:50:15,350
Oh, man, you don't know,
this ban against smoking,

703
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:17,442
can you believe that shit?

704
00:50:17,863 --> 00:50:21,362
So here's what we got
on Dino Ortolani's murder, Ryan.

705
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:24,201
Jefferson Keane and his crew did it.

706
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:26,569
Really?

707
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:31,617
Yeah. l don't know which one actually
lit the match yet, but makes sense.

708
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:34,077
l mean, Ortolani
put Keane's brother in lCU.

709
00:50:34,296 --> 00:50:37,250
That kind of thing
don't go unpunished around here.

710
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:39,339
What has me fucked up is,

711
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:42,961
who arranged for the guy
who did the deed to get in the hole?

712
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,430
l mean, that would have to be
a pretty well-connected son of a bitch.

713
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,308
l mean, connected to two officers
on duty.

714
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:51,270
Well, the niggers could've just paid
a hack to let them in.

715
00:50:51,438 --> 00:50:54,059
No. An inmate arranged it all.

716
00:50:54,274 --> 00:50:57,358
- And now l know who that inmate is.
- You do?

717
00:50:57,569 --> 00:50:58,897
Sure.

718
00:50:59,112 --> 00:51:00,571
Same guy connected enough

719
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:03,111
to get moved from Gen Pop
into Emerald City.

720
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:06,943
Same guy Ortolani shot in the chest.
You.

721
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,789
Me? You're kidding me, right?

722
00:51:09,998 --> 00:51:13,830
Eventually, l'm gonna get
the little fuck who killed Ortolani

723
00:51:14,044 --> 00:51:16,332
and he's gonna start singing.

724
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:19,333
And the only name
that fucking nigger is gonna rap

725
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:21,423
is the skinny-ass white boy's.

726
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:29,635
My advice to you is to give him up now
or shut him up soon.

727
00:51:32,187 --> 00:51:33,350
Thanks for stopping by.

728
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:40,060
Mr. Schibetta,

729
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:43,234
l know who killed Dino.

730
00:51:58,588 --> 00:52:00,130
Can l help you?

731
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,629
Black 1 0 on the Jack.

732
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:09,973
- Thanks.
- l'm very sorry, Nino.

733
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,134
She's been sick, you know.

734
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:16,602
For the past year.

735
00:52:17,315 --> 00:52:19,142
Cancer.

736
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,403
So it's not unexpected.

737
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:28,815
- Even so...
- ls there anything l can do?

738
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:35,824
l'm very grateful for your concern.

739
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,953
l'd just like to be alone
for a little while.

740
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:40,795
Sure.

741
00:52:41,006 --> 00:52:43,497
Let me know if you need anything.

742
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:50,218
Sorry about Ange, Skipper.

743
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:53,973
Such a good woman.

744
00:52:54,728 --> 00:52:57,017
Such a patient woman.

745
00:52:59,024 --> 00:53:01,312
l'm not the easiest man to live with,
you know.

746
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:03,602
Yeah, l know.

747
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,360
l want Angie's funeral
to be magnificent.

748
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:14,077
l want a gold and bronze casket.

749
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:16,495
Red velvet interior.

750
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:21,204
At the wake, l want,
on both sides of her, calla lilies.

751
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:23,544
She held them on her wedding day.

752
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:26,758
And get that actor she likes
to be one of her pallbearers.

753
00:53:26,968 --> 00:53:28,961
- Which actor?
- You know, he's a big movie star.

754
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:33,046
What's his name? He was
in that movie where the thing blew up.

755
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:35,223
Oh, yeah, l know who you mean.
Tall guy.

756
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:38,513
- Yeah. And Lena Horne.
- As a pallbearer?

757
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,059
Sing a hymn.

758
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:43,060
Tell the Cardinal
to go easy on the incense.

759
00:53:43,276 --> 00:53:46,063
The smell makes-- Makes my--

760
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:48,023
Oh, Jesus. Angie.

761
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:04,463
l'm gonna ask you this once:

762
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:06,921
Who paid you to kill Dino Ortolani?

763
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:09,292
Fuck you. Fuck you.

764
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:11,468
Fuck you, fucking dago.

765
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,843
Before l did it,
l fucked him up the ass.

766
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:18,518
Kill him.

767
00:54:18,728 --> 00:54:21,017
Start with his dick.

768
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:29,146
What the fuck you all gonna do, huh?
Fucking dagos.

769
00:54:29,364 --> 00:54:30,739
Fuck you.

770
00:54:30,949 --> 00:54:32,776
Sex and death.

771
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:36,029
They're different but the same.

772
00:54:36,246 --> 00:54:40,374
To reach that final moment,
that climax,

773
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:43,454
you gotta give up control

774
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,793
of your body,

775
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:49,842
of your soul.

776
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:56,005
Another inmate at Oswald State
Penitentiary was murdered yesterday,

777
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:58,550
the second such incident
in as many weeks.

778
00:54:58,768 --> 00:55:01,306
John Post,
a drug dealer serving life,

779
00:55:01,521 --> 00:55:04,475
was found in a utility closet
at the prison mutilated,

780
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:07,811
his fingers missing
and several stab wounds to his heart.

781
00:55:08,028 --> 00:55:10,151
Authorities are investigating
both murders

782
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:11,864
but still have no suspects.

783
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:16,403
ln a related story, state legislators
have overwhelmingly passed a bill

784
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,704
banning conjugal visits
between the inmates and their wives.

785
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:21,907
Governor James Devlin
has hailed the vote

786
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:25,334
as a victory for law-abiding citizens.

787
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:30,338
And love? Well, if sex is sweet
and death is bitter,

788
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,342
love is both.

789
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:36,639
Love will always and forever
break your heart.
