1
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,921
People are always looking
to have their fortunes told.

2
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,325
They get their cards read,
their palms read,

3
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,063
even the bumps
on their head.

4
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,868
Well, if that card
ain't credit, why read it?

5
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,636
If that palm ain't holding something,
let it go, and shit,

6
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,042
if you've got bumps on your head
big enough to read,

7
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,773
forget about
your future, yo,

8
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,078
because your problems
are in the here and now.

9
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:03,516
Ahmad Lalar was murdered
by James Robson.

10
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,255
You keep saying that, but you offer
no proof. Look, I need evidence.

11
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,525
A witness, the murder weapon,
anything.

12
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,832
Robson may not have
sliced Ahmad himself.

13
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,168
He may have assigned another Aryan
to do the job, as he did Salah Udeen.

14
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,036
Then getting a conviction
is gonna be harder.

15
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,941
- So what do you intend to do?
- Continue the investigation.

16
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,969
Yes, you drag out the process,
hoping that everyone's gonna forget?

17
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,709
Let me tell you this,
Warden,

18
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,046
we won't forget.

19
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,419
Lalar's death
must not go unpunished.

20
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,790
It won't. Believe me,
Robson's day of reckoning

21
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,796
- and retribution is coming.
- Mail call!

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,066
Yo, you got Minister Said's
mail in there?

23
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,505
You know, Omar,

24
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,339
I discovered that the minister
and I have something in common.

25
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,277
Yeah, okay.

26
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,143
We both
support slavery.

27
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,048
For me, slavery
don't exist anymore,

28
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,607
which is
a damned shame.

29
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,984
But according
to this book in the library,

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,012
for those Muslims,

31
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,184
slavery is alive
and well in Africa.

32
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,420
That's right.

33
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,190
I figured Said
must've known that, too,

34
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,528
since he went
and got himself one.

35
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,158
You.

36
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,828
What the fuck
you jabbering about?

37
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,032
I ain't nobody's motherfucking
slave and shit, man.

38
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,700
You tote that barge,
you lift that bale...

39
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,369
you's his house nigger.

40
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,379
You motherfucker!

41
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,813
Omar! Come here!

42
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,816
Look, I know I ain't
supposed to fight, but...

43
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,751
but don't no-motherfucking-body
talk to me like that!

44
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,482
Come here now!

45
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,650
- Oooh!
- You heard that shit, yo?

46
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,958
Fuck, huh?

47
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,731
I am your
fucking nigger, huh?

48
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,964
Fuck!

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,570
? I wanna hold your hand,
walk along the sand?

50
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,107
? Laughing in the sun,
always having fun?

51
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,585
? Whoa, whoa.?

52
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,486
You sing like shit.

53
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,460
? I wanna hold your hand,
walk along the sand?

54
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,990
? La la la?

55
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,630
? I wanna hold your hand,
walk along the sand?

56
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,765
? La-la-la-la-la,
la la la.?

57
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,546
What was Reggie Rawls
doing in this room?

58
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,210
Oh, Reggie?
He's a big fan, man.

59
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,446
He's a major drug dealer
in Unit C.

60
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,853
Yo, yo, man, he hear music,
he drawn in and shit.

61
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,880
Omar...

62
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,921
are you selling drugs
from this room?

63
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,832
No.

64
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,701
Are you
selling drugs?

65
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,831
Well, yeah, man.
What the fuck, huh? Shit.

66
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,900
I mean, I ain't doing them
and shit, man, or using them or nothing.

67
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,604
You know,
what you thinking, man?

68
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,636
- That's the deal, ain't it?
- No, it is not.

69
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,842
Selling drugs
is using them.

70
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,680
My piss test
say different.

71
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,686
I don't care
what your drug tests say,

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,052
it's what I say
that matters.

73
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,556
Yeah?

74
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,526
Well, I say, "Fuck you."

75
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,394
Watch. Fuck you.

76
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,923
No, fuck you!

77
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,594
Hey, yo, Said...

78
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,365
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

79
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,202
- No, no! Help!
- Fuck you! Fuck!

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,107
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Help! Help!

81
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,948
I'm waiting.

82
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,977
For what?

83
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,250
An explanation.

84
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,225
Like I said,
for what?

85
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,954
For the beating
you put on White.

86
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,428
A reason makes
a difference, McManus?

87
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,622
I beat him!

88
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,726
I failed him...

89
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,635
- him and myself.
- Everything was going so well.

90
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,106
Why didn't you
come to me?

91
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,166
You don't get it, McManus,
you don't get it.

92
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,770
The only thing I need
to get from you is an explanation.

93
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,780
And until I do,
you can fucking rot!

94
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,386
Why?

95
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,981
Why?

96
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,962
I tell you, I don't know why
the motherfucker attacked me, man!

97
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,797
You're beat to shit
for no reason? Bullshit.

98
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,700
All right, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

99
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,705
But look, don't let
what I say blur the fact

100
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,934
that what I'm getting ready
to fucking tell you

101
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,002
is the absolute, straight up, goddamn,
motherfucking truth. You understand?

102
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,876
I was moving drugs,
okay?

103
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,610
You're fucking shitting me.
From your practice room?

104
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,118
No, man, hear me out.
I was threatened.

105
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,848
I mean, I didn't
do nothing, man.

106
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,947
I swear to fucking God,
I didn't touch shit.

107
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,082
Who are you
moving them for?

108
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,115
If I tell you that, man,
I'm dead.

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,855
- I'm seriously dead.
- All right, all right,

110
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,260
let's put that aside
for now.

111
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,821
McManus,
I am clean, man!

112
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,628
- I am clean...
- Shut up!

113
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,602
Will you fucking
shut up one second?!

114
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,902
Please, as a favor,

115
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,931
don't put me back
in solitary again, man.

116
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,272
Goddamn it, Omar,
I oughta.

117
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,177
All right,
here's the deal.

118
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,205
From now on,
you rehearse in your pod.

119
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,183
No more fucking
practice room.

120
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,415
And your piss shows even
a hint of aspirin, you're toast.

121
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,650
Okay? Do you
understand me?

122
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,089
I hear you.

123
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,625
Afternoon, gents.

124
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,501
Our lmam is in the hole
'cause of you.

125
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,028
Huh-uh.

126
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,633
That motherfucker's in there
'cause he can't get a grip

127
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,166
on his own
goddamn guidance.

128
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,616
You're toxic, White.

129
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,552
You managed to turn the only person
on your side against you.

130
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,681
The rest of us, we saw
this disaster coming.

131
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,151
Every day Said
is in the hole,

132
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,058
is a day you're
out here alone.

133
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,723
Yeah? Well...

134
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,959
I gotta go practice.

135
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,711
Fuck me.

136
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,678
I hate your voice.

137
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,558
McManus.

138
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,899
Lockdown's in a couple
of minutes.

139
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,270
Why aren't you
in your pod?

140
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,832
Look, where you
headed to?

141
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,741
To the hole?

142
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,406
You know, 'cause maybe
you and me should go on over there,

143
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,109
you know, maybe see how
Said's weathering the storm.

144
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,549
Why, what do you care?

145
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,179
I'm kind of
floundering here.

146
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,381
Floundering?

147
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,754
I mean, old mojo,
you know, I mean,

148
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,989
he ain't treating Omar
so great these days.

149
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,933
Without...
Said here...

150
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:34,003
see, everything's just...
kind of harder.

151
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,304
I mean, I really
need that fuck.

152
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,405
Who knew?

153
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,090
Come on.

154
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,497
- We're going back to Em City.
- What if I refuse?

155
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,695
You'd be
the first person who did.

156
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,501
I'm not ready to leave,
I don't deserve to.

157
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,737
You know, Omar told me
what happened and why.

158
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,970
Why...

159
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,344
and yet again,
I lost my humanity

160
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,477
in pursuit of what I thought
was the greater good.

161
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,722
You know, Said,

162
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,248
I don't think that you
lost your humanity at all.

163
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,591
I think what scares you
is that your actions

164
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,597
are completely human.

165
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,928
Let's go.

166
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,832
McManus, either I find
my soul in this place,

167
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,098
or I am lost forever.

168
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,470
I need more time.
I need more time, please?

169
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,907
Please?

170
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,207
Man, this is crazy.

171
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,315
All right.

172
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,955
I'll wait
to hear from you.

173
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,194
And then you're
back in Em City

174
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,094
dancing
with Omar White.

175
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,355
What kind of people
become fortune-tellers?

176
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,985
Most times, they're
a bunch of half-literate,

177
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,995
middle-aged women
who only tell you stuff

178
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,792
they wish would
happen to them.

179
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,662
They fabricate
your dreams,

180
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,930
because theirs got
dashed on the rocks.

181
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,937
So, how you
figure dat, huh?

182
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,565
Having your
future told...

183
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,009
by someone
who ain't got one?

184
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,277
Doctor, what the fuck
is wrong with me?

185
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:01,013
I'm hot, I've got
rashes, diarrhea.

186
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,414
Well, I'm afraid
what you have is...

187
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,391
it's called
a staph infection.

188
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,655
Sometimes when a wound
gets infected,

189
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,821
toxins are released
into the bloodstream,

190
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,060
- and these toxins tunnel into tissue...
- That's why all the drugs?

191
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,590
Well, antibiotics, yes.

192
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,727
But your system seems
to be resistant to them.

193
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,603
And I got this
from being in the hospital?

194
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,830
Yeah.

195
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,538
Am I gonna die?

196
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,446
Look, we're doing
everything we can, all right?

197
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,747
- I'm sure that...
- Oh, Christ, don't let me die.

198
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,548
I don't wanna die.

199
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,885
I don't want to die
lying in my own shit.

200
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,516
Oh, man,
oh, man,

201
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,925
I'm getting hard just
looking at that beauty.

202
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,259
Rack 'em, Prag.

203
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,561
So, I hear Pancamo
caught the flu or something.

204
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,592
- It may be fatal.
- Good.

205
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,570
If it isn't,
when he gets out,

206
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,334
we'll make it fatal.

207
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,898
Schibetta's in the psych unit,
Urbano's in the hole,

208
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,410
and the Sicilians don't run
the cafeteria anymore.

209
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,108
Those wiseguys ain't looking
that wise these days.

210
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,447
Meanwhile...

211
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,213
we got other fish
to fry.

212
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,254
You know, sweet pea,

213
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,451
I like a nice, firm ass.

214
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,084
You need to
go to the gym.

215
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,822
Yes, sir.

216
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,092
And if you see your buddy
Adam Guenzel there,

217
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,124
I need you to give him
some pertinent information.

218
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,330
About what, sir?

219
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,807
About his buddy,
Tobias Beecher.

220
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,001
How was your visit
with your mother and dad?

221
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,946
She cried the whole time.
It was embarrassing.

222
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,041
Well, you should be grateful
somebody's crying about you at all.

223
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,611
Okay,
that's enough.

224
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,486
Stop.

225
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,650
- Come on, stop.
- Oh, cut it out.

226
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,819
- Come on.
- I'm gonna go use the free weights.

227
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,853
I got to get you back to Em City
before I go to work for Sister Pete.

228
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,695
- I can get back to Em City myself.
- Yeah, but...

229
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,827
Look, I gotta start
being my own man.

230
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,197
Ah, okay.

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,740
- Hey there, handsome.
- Fuck you.

232
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,910
Hey, what's with
the attitude, man?

233
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,113
Hey, pal, I'm in here
because of you.

234
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,748
- I didn't wanna rape that girl.
- Look at yourself.

235
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,418
- Look at what you've turned into.
- I had to, to survive.

236
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,450
You don't see me
all dolled up.

237
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,122
That's because you got Beecher.
From what I understand,

238
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,724
- you're paying the same price for
protection. - Bullshit!

239
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,757
Everybody knows
Beecher's a fucking fag,

240
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,827
and that you're
sucking his cock.

241
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,396
What?! What'd you say,
you stupid fuck?!

242
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,135
Come on, fuck!

243
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,167
You fucking bitch!

244
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,202
Fucking psycho!

245
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,181
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

246
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,342
Winthrop came on to me.
I had to set him straight.

247
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,750
- I thought you two were friends.
- Not anymore.

248
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,949
All right, since this
is your first offense,

249
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,323
I'm gonna be lenient, but you only get
one hall pass, you understand?

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,987
Yes, sir.

251
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,529
So, he slapped you
on the wrist?

252
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,398
Just like you said
he would.

253
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,869
You don't wanna spend
any time in the hole, Adam.

254
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,066
I already got my lecture
for the day, okay?

255
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,301
Hey, are you
all right?

256
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,899
Don't be fucking
touching me!

257
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,445
I wanna say something
about our last session,

258
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,383
when we were
discussing homosexuality.

259
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,182
At the time,

260
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,021
I implied that I never
harmed you, Beecher.

261
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,460
Well...

262
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,522
my reaction was...
knee-jerk.

263
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,168
You have to understand,

264
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,397
I was worried
about saying anything out loud

265
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,497
that might expose me

266
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,032
to possible disciplinary

267
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,874
or legal action.

268
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,381
I did abuse you
when you arrived.

269
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,790
And for that,
I am sorry.

270
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,623
I ask your
forgiveness.

271
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,768
Tobias...

272
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,338
do you accept
his apology?

273
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,077
I...

274
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,906
I don't know.

275
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,818
So, the FBI has decided
to let the local D.A. Prosecute you.

276
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,153
- Why?
- The eyewitness that came forward

277
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,557
claims to have seen you
dump Brice Tibbetts' body

278
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,561
in a field outside
of Alden township.

279
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,587
But the FBI only has jurisdiction
if they can prove

280
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,328
that you brought Tibbetts
across the state line, which they can't.

281
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,098
Let's say that I did
dump the body.

282
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,866
It doesn't mean
that I killed the guy.

283
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,600
Exactly.

284
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,938
See, now if I'm gonna
keep you off death row,

285
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,968
we'll have to create
that doubt in the jury's mind.

286
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,915
- But you said you didn't kill Tibbetts.
- That's right.

287
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,976
- What were you doing with the body?
- It wasn't me.

288
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,421
Okay, 'cause the eyewitness,
he picked you out of a lineup, so...

289
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,521
Catherine,
it wasn't me.

290
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,030
Now this witness says
that it was nighttime, right?

291
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,692
There's no lights
at nighttime.

292
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,634
All of a sudden, this motherfucker's
got x-ray vision?

293
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,695
Well. Jeez, Keller,
you don't need me,

294
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,072
so you can just plead
your own case.

295
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,436
- You're prettier.
- Not by much.

296
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,046
- The arraignment's tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,077
Ready for a little trip
into town?

298
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,748
What, and leave
this place?

299
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,451
Jeez,
I don't know.

300
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,983
Officer?

301
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,219
Till the a.m.

302
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,290
You gonna see Toby?

303
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,164
Yes.

304
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,137
Tell him I had
a funny dream about him.

305
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,198
He was elected President
of the United States.

306
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,049
I had a dream
about you and me.

307
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,393
Yeah?

308
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,727
We were gladiators.

309
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,063
Your name was Sextus.

310
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,127
Mine was Cunnilinga.

311
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,569
God, it is good
to see you.

312
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,601
Yes, you too.

313
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,507
Oh, I spoke to Holly
this morning,

314
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,743
and she said she had
such a great time

315
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,753
at Adventure Country with you
and your son Brad.

316
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,312
She's a wonderful kid.

317
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,119
How'd your meeting
go with Keller?

318
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,183
Good.

319
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,092
Good.

320
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,461
We're well on our way
to building a solid defense.

321
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,694
Toby, he never talked
about these killings, did he?

322
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,673
No.

323
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,240
You wouldn't lie to me
in order to protect him?

324
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,939
No.

325
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,411
Okay.

326
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,482
I'll see you.

327
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,616
Oh, Catherine, Keller...

328
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,026
he didn't give you
a message for me, did he?

329
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,554
No.

330
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,301
So, there's two ways
this could go, precious.

331
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,535
They both end the same:
With my dick up your ass.

332
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,705
Beecher, I need
to talk to you.

333
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,385
- Look...
- I didn't wanna say in our session.

334
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,548
I tried to convince Robson
not to rape your boy, Guenzel.

335
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,559
But you know Robson,
he's headstrong.

336
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,255
Anyway, the Sicilians
stopped him and I'm glad.

337
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,522
You're glad?

338
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,467
Yeah, well,
not glad, exactly.

339
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,732
I'm like you.

340
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,602
I'm all turned around,
you know.

341
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,608
I'm trying to stop
the shit in my life,

342
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,544
but it's Oz,
you know?

343
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,310
I realize I can't
stop most of it,

344
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,180
but I can do
some things.

345
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,584
Now, I heard
what's going on.

346
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,679
The warden won't
let you see Keller.

347
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,954
So, I'm offering
on my next mail run...

348
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,984
to take a letter
to Keller for you.

349
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,924
You'd do that?
You would?

350
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,232
You write it up,
I'll slip it through.

351
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm...

352
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,739
What? Amazed?
In shock?

353
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,107
Suspicious.

354
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:52,913
Well, you have
every right to be.

355
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,976
But I swear to you,

356
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,114
on the graves
of both of my sons,

357
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,886
I'm just trying
to make up for the past.

358
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,692
Trying to clear my conscience
so I can move on.

359
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,242
Hello there,
Keller.

360
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,573
Schillinger,
my old friend.

361
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,210
I got a package
from one of your ex-wives,

362
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,051
subscription renewal notice
from Sports Illustrated...

363
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,118
and this,
from Beecher.

364
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,294
What's the game?

365
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,165
No game.

366
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,636
Tomorrow,
if you want,

367
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,541
I'll take your letter
back to Beecher.

368
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,250
Lights out!

369
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,061
Adam?

370
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,967
Is everything
all right?

371
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,902
You haven't said
a word all evening.

372
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,269
Were you a fag
before you came to Oz,

373
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,571
or did you
start here?

374
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,304
What?

375
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,212
I've been asking around.
I heard some stories, are they true?

376
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,715
It depends
on what you heard.

377
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,151
That when you first arrived,
you were Schillinger's bitch.

378
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,786
- Yes.
- Then some guy named Keller's bitch?

379
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,453
Not... bitch, exactly.

380
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,928
Then what,
his girlfriend?

381
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,763
People like to reduce things
to their most basic form.

382
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,861
You're either a fag
or you're not a fag.

383
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,168
And if you are,
you should have told me

384
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,970
instead of pretending
to act normal,

385
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,806
pretending to care about me
for the right reasons.

386
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,040
Adam, I do care about you
for the right reasons.

387
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,173
- Stay back!
- Come on, don't be an asshole.

388
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,377
Oh, you'd like that, huh?
To be up my asshole?

389
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,442
Shut the fuck up!

390
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,284
Get the fuck off me,
you fucking faggot!

391
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,315
- Just stop. Just stop.
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

392
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,157
- Break it up!
- I don't need that fucking faggot!

393
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,220
I'm telling you,
this faggot grabbed me.

394
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,062
I don't wanna spend
another night in the same cell as him.

395
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,728
Fine. But since all the cells
in Em City are full,

396
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,399
and since you need a little attitude
adjustment, I'm putting you in the cage.

397
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,705
Me?! I didn't do shit! Get your
fucking hands off me, you fuck!

398
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,506
The boy's got problems.

399
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,105
He raped a girl,
beat her brains in.

400
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,809
I know.

401
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,046
I've known Adam's family
for a long time.

402
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,077
I know, that's why
I made you his sponsor,

403
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,249
but I'm beginning to think I made
a mistake bringing him to Em City.

404
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,782
- Maybe I should transfer him out.
- Don't.

405
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,892
I can turn him around.

406
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,093
- Give me a chance.
- Okay, a chance.

407
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,742
Faggot.

408
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,177
Faggot.

409
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,181
Faggot.

410
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,807
Faggot.

411
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,340
Faggot!

412
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,682
Faggot!

413
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,243
Faggot!

414
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,721
Faggot!

415
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,451
Faggot!

416
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,753
Faggot!

417
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,191
Faggot!

418
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,195
Faggot!

419
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,288
Faggot!

420
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,855
Faggot!

421
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,196
Faggot!

422
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,565
Faggot!

423
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,830
Faggot!

424
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,395
I have a way for you and Keller
to meet face to face.

425
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,634
Yeah, how?

426
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,302
Come work for me
in the post office.

427
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,971
I'll let you deliver the mail
to protective custody.

428
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,242
Quit Sister Pete?

429
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,748
Well, yeah,
you'd have to.

430
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,216
And I'd get
to see Keller?

431
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,479
Every day.

432
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,487
Okay.

433
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,149
There's just one thing
that I'd ask for in trade.

434
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,055
What's that?

435
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,492
The boy.
Give me the boy.

436
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,696
What?

437
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,131
Tell the Sicilians to back off
and let me have him,

438
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,102
to do with
whatever I choose.

439
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,696
This is what this
has all been about?

440
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,434
What do you mean?

441
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,635
The "I'm trying
to change my ways" crap.

442
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,871
You know, it...

443
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,971
I almost believed you.

444
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,845
Oh, it's true.

445
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,010
But really,
it's beside the point.

446
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,485
I have a practical solution
to your problem.

447
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,388
You're asking me to get
the thing I want most

448
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,822
to allow you
to subject Adam

449
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,691
to the same horrors
you put me through? No way.

450
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,958
Hmm. Not even
for Keller?

451
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,294
Not even for Keller.

452
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,960
Well, I have to admit,
I'm stunned.

453
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,867
I admire your strength
of character.

454
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,032
I respect your decision. We'll just
leave the whole matter at that.

455
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,507
Yeah, you never leave
anything at that.

456
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,937
Well, nobody
changes overnight.

457
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,107
Be sure to eat
your vegetables.

458
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,013
Who's to say
that the future

459
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,615
ain't fucking
with the fortune-teller?

460
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,422
Let's say that she tells you
you're gonna fall in love.

461
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,294
But she
doesn't tell you

462
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,823
that your beloved's
gonna die of cancer,

463
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,428
and that she really is
your long-lost sister,

464
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,370
and a serial killer.

465
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,601
Because the fortune-teller
don't know that.

466
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,805
What if God or the spirits
or whatever

467
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,372
is only telling the fortune-teller
half the story...

468
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,517
half the truth?

469
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,954
- Fucking Friday.
- Fucking Friday?

470
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,084
Yeah, you'd think I'd be happy
with the weekend coming, and all.

471
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:39,722
Working in Oz, I never feel
more fucked than on Friday.

472
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,994
Hmm, payday.

473
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,194
I don't know
if I'd call it pay.

474
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,567
Man makes
a dogshit wage,

475
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,733
money none of those cocksucking
congressmen would work for, huh?

476
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,369
- Hey, you gotta laugh.
- You follow pro basketball?

477
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,380
- Huh, basketball?
- Yeah.

478
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,814
Who do you think
the worst player in the NBA is?

479
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,477
Some white guy.

480
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,385
Actually, maybe two or three
white guys battling for the honor.

481
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,184
Yeah, that's gotta
piss you off.

482
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,191
Seeing some of these jags
play pro ball

483
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,217
- knowing you're better?
- Why would that piss me off?

484
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,161
You know how goddamn good
you've gotta be

485
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,961
in order to be the worst player
in the NBA? You gotta be phenomenal.

486
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,093
No, I realize that,
I was just saying...

487
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,729
My point was that even
the worst player in the NBA

488
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,036
still makes league minimum:
$330,000 a year.

489
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,702
- Wow.
- Take away what the government gets,

490
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,211
your agent's 4%,

491
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,770
worst case scenario,
you've still got 160.

492
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,544
Fuck it, 150,
even 140,

493
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,518
say you wanna jerk off
with 10 of it.

494
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:38,386
That's $140,000 cash,
in pocket!

495
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,119
Hey Dave, man, I didn't mean
to get you all riled up.

496
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,162
It's not you.

497
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,993
It's fucking Friday.

498
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,057
So, all the blood tests
came back negative.

499
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,000
We should run them again
in three months.

500
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,867
And Martinez,
how are his blood tests?

501
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,498
Oh, he doesn't have AIDS,
if that's what you're asking.

502
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,973
That doesn't
necessarily mean

503
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,839
it was his blood
that got thrown at you.

504
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,509
Why'd you douse me,
you prick?

505
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,539
Because you're the prick,
you prick.

506
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,982
Hey, stop that!

507
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,111
Oh, okay, so it's
okay for you

508
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,281
to hit this cocksucker,
but not me?!

509
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,360
Officer Brass?

510
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,453
Officer Brass?

511
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,828
- What?
- Did you buy my Mightyball ticket?

512
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,766
What?
Yeah, yeah.

513
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,962
It's almost time, I'm so excited.
Aren't you excited, Bob?

514
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,474
Excited about what?

515
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,271
The Mightyball drawing,
$2 million,

516
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,404
which if you win will go towards
finding a cure for your grandson.

517
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,744
How can you not
be excited?

518
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,840
What if God didn't give me
the right numbers?

519
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,511
What if I don't win?

520
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,613
Then little Alex dies.

521
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,425
Today's numbers
will be randomly selected

522
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,557
from 51 numbered balls

523
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,658
out of our
lotto draw hopper.

524
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,397
So, everybody,
get it out and get it ready,

525
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,167
'cause it's time
to play Mightyball.

526
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,168
If your number
is drawn,

527
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,842
you could be the lucky winner
of $2 million.

528
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,977
The first number is...
seven.

529
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,149
Seven, Bob,
that's a match.

530
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,558
The second number
is...

531
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,857
10.

532
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,193
That's two.

533
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,559
Three.

534
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,700
The fourth number is...

535
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,034
49.

536
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,307
Four for four.

537
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,917
The fifth number is...

538
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,844
30.

539
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,646
And the final number,

540
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,818
and the winner
of $2 million is...

541
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,356
51.

542
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,938
Motherfucker, you gotta be
fucking fucking me.

543
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:14,343
Yeah! Jesus Christ,
I fucking won! Ah!

544
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,212
- You won?
- Yeah, motherfucker, I won!

545
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,011
God damn it, yes!

546
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,382
Oh, shit!
Fuck!

547
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,852
Oh, yeah!
Shit!

548
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,358
Shit! Fuck!

549
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,556
God damn it!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

550
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,088
Yeah!

551
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,975
I know, it's wild.

552
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,883
Yeah, all right,
all right.

553
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,547
Okay, okay, bye.

554
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,454
Yeah.

555
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,023
Rebadow's making
a fuss all day.

556
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,997
He claims that Brass
didn't win the lottery, he did.

557
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,226
Oh, yeah?
All right.

558
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,497
All right,
bring him in.

559
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,398
- Bob.
- I need to speak with Officer Brass.

560
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,307
- I've been waiting.
- Slow down, slow down.

561
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,541
7-10-3-49-30-51,
those are my numbers.

562
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,775
I had officer Brass
purchase the ticket for me.

563
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,946
Bob, memorizing
the winning numbers doesn't prove...

564
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,649
You don't believe me?
Ask Officer Brass.

565
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,852
- Are you serious?
- On my dying grandson's life.

566
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,625
Well, Bob,
Dave Brass isn't here.

567
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,723
I mean, when he found out
he won, he just left.

568
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,532
He didn't go to his locker.
He didn't punch out.

569
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,367
Can't you
find him somehow?

570
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,908
Let me see
what I can do.

571
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,636
You walk
by a storefront,

572
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,478
a fortune-teller
beckons you inside.

573
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,950
You know it's a scam,
but you go anyway.

574
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,919
As she flips the cards,

575
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,888
you say to yourself,
"This is bullshit."

576
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,859
And yet, she says the one thing
you really wanna hear.

577
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,555
You lean in
a little closer,

578
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,464
hoping, praying that she
actually knows the truth.

579
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,764
Well, I came
straight from work.

580
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,430
I'm a C.O. At the Oswald
Correctional Facility.

581
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,938
Well, not anymore.

582
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,465
I quit! Woo!

583
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,511
I won! Woo!

584
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,084
Tim, any word
from Brass?

585
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,486
No, nobody's
heard from him.

586
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,388
Not his family,
not his girlfriend.

587
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,325
He left the lottery
claim center

588
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,590
and hopped a plane
to parts unknown.

589
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,119
Damn.

590
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,729
I was with Brass
during the drawing.

591
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,860
He was out of his mind
because he won,

592
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,303
you know, as you would be.
But thinking about it now,

593
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,706
he must have been saying to himself,
"Fuck you, Rebadow."

594
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,336
I'll tell you, if it was one
of the other dinks in this joint

595
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,279
and I was Brass,
I would've ripped them off too.

596
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,043
But to do it
to a guy like Rebadow,

597
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,779
you know, he's got a dying grandson,
not throw him a bone...

598
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,548
I mean, that's
dead-of-winter cold.

599
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,145
Brass was a good guy.

600
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,521
Obviously not
that good of a guy.

601
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,526
When we played basketball
against Vahue,

602
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,289
I got to know him.

603
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,786
He was the most stand-up, do-right-by-you
person I ever met.

604
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,199
Well, guess that's what
two mill can do to a fellow.

605
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,567
No, it wasn't the money,
he felt fucked over.

606
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,937
I mean, he had a big pair
of gigantic NBA tits in his face

607
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,204
and we say to him,
"No, no, no, no, you work in Oz.

608
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,406
You get to get your Achilles' tendon
slashed for no good reason

609
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,573
except McManus can't
keep his mouth shut."

610
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,243
You gonna blame yourself
for what happened forever?

611
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,013
Yeah.

612
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,886
Dave Brass came to Oz
and filled out an application.

613
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,390
Nobody forced him
to do that, right?

614
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,359
He got his leg fucked up,
that sucks.

615
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,625
But this is
a maximum-security prison.

616
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,099
The poor guy got piss and shit
thrown at him, he could get AIDS.

617
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,830
That'd be a lot worse
than being a goddamn gimp.

618
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,201
But you know what?

619
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,103
He filled out
an application.

620
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,706
Tim, every night

621
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,904
I get down on my knees
and pray to God

622
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,742
I don't get shanked
when I come to work.

623
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,614
But what if it happens?
What if one of these fucking animals

624
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,140
ends up butt-fucking me?

625
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,619
Are you gonna blame yourself
because you brought me into Oz?

626
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,555
Because if you did,
you'd be a goddamn idiot.

627
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,081
I filled out
an application.

628
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,405
Cold out there,
ain't it?

629
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,635
Oh, you're telling me.

630
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,576
I wish I had a fur coat like one
of your seeing-eye dogs.

631
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,240
- We prefer to call them guide-dogs.
- Well, what's the difference?

632
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,147
Well, you work
for the governor.

633
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,982
You should know what it's like
being politically correct.

634
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,955
How's the program going?

635
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,481
Well, it's a real testament
to man's best friend.

636
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,962
I have three of the more disparate
inmates that I've ever had,

637
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,021
and each of them are
doing a wonderful job.

638
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,590
I'm impressed.

639
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,499
Most skeptics
usually are.

640
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,026
- Oh.
- Catch you later.

641
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,850
Hey, Layla.

642
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,192
It's hot in here
this morning.

643
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,059
Layla.

644
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,659
Lay...

645
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,841
He's got septicemia, a kidney disease.
He went into septic shock.

646
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,646
We managed to bring
his temperature down from 105.

647
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,414
This is, like what?
A virus? Is it contagious?

648
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,252
No, it's a bacterial infection.
Oftentimes, paraplegics

649
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,814
are prone
to kidney disorders,

650
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,053
especially if they take
poor care of themselves.

651
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,257
Wait, wait. Augustus is nearly
maniacal about his upkeep.

652
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,993
- There's something else.
- What?

653
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:13,265
He's also got a shitload
of heroin in his bloodstream.

654
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,200
Everybody, back up.
Keep your wrist stiff.

655
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,303
Whoa, what the fuck
is this, man?

656
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,940
Miss Sally's new
TV series, "Sallycise."

657
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,712
- It's a health and exercise show.
- Well, one of my muscles

658
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,448
- is already getting bigger.
- What's the latest on Hill?

659
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,921
Is Augustus
gonna be okay?

660
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,516
Yo, what's up?
Did he O.D., man?

661
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,459
McManus, how's Augustus?

662
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,722
So, how's he doing?

663
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,525
You son of a bitch.

664
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,691
Augustus' blood
is swimming in heroin.

665
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,859
You want to fucking
tell me about that, do you?

666
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,870
I don't know nothing about that!
Just tell me how the fuck he is!

667
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,635
He's dying. He's lying
in a fucking hospital bed, dying.

668
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,166
Well, why are you standing here
trying to talk to me?

669
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,906
I wanna know who
gave him the drugs.

670
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,177
I don't know nothing about that.
I swear to you, you gotta believe me.

671
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,741
- Why the fuck should I believe you?
- I'm getting old!

672
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,582
I should've died
a long time ago.

673
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,521
But there's one thing I won't do,
and that's outlive that boy.

674
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,219
Now you go and do everything
you can for him, and I swear to you,

675
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,457
I'll find out who it was
that gave him that smack!

676
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,726
All right,
and when you do,

677
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,097
you bring him straight to me.
You understand me?

678
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,072
- Yo, Burr, how's our boy doing?
- You been feeding him tits?

679
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,309
Why, he overdosed or something?
I thought it was a kidney thing.

680
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,318
Brought on by some motherfucker
that got him smack.

681
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,718
And you at the top
of my list, Poet!

682
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,814
What, me?
No way, man. No way!

683
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:44,226
I swear to you,
I will root out the truth.

684
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,093
You keeping digging,
motherfucker,

685
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,995
but I didn't
give him shit.

686
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,262
You know,
you got a lot of enemies, Burr.

687
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,292
Before you start
accusing your friends,

688
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:55,100
you need to go check out
them Sicilians and them spics.

689
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,505
That's what
you need to do.

690
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,305
Prisoner #97P528:

691
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,678
Greg Penders:

692
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,741
Convicted May 7th, 1997:

693
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,753
Criminally negligent
homicide:

694
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,255
Sentence: 17 years:

695
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,723
Up for parole
in nine.

696
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,387
- You heard the news?
- Yeah, too bad.

697
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,693
Augustus was doing
a great job with Layla.

698
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,858
Well, what are
the steaks for?

699
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,562
They're for
today's training.

700
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,536
We're gonna teach
the dogs to cook?

701
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,903
You're gonna teach
the dogs self-control.

702
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,738
Now, it's of primary importance
that your dog's attention

703
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,303
at all times remains
focused on you,

704
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,611
even when tempted
with those things that,

705
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,378
as a dog,
they love.

706
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,180
Like raw
fucking meat.

707
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,312
Or cats or other dogs,
anything.

708
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,084
So, the two of you
head on over there.

709
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,795
This is fucking
unbelievable.

710
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,827
You know, I haven't seen
a steak in six years,

711
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,600
and now you're gonna
put it on the floor,

712
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,038
so a dog
won't eat it?

713
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,632
Miguel,
you go first.

714
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,009
Have Julie lead you along,
but towards the steak.

715
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,741
Yeah, but what do I do
if she goes for it?

716
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,147
You give her lead
a firm tug and say, "No."

717
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,345
No!

718
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,320
Julie, no!

719
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,053
Good girl,
good girl.

720
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,524
Come on.

721
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,388
Julie, no!

722
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,056
Julie!

723
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,428
No!

724
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,659
Shit!

725
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,224
This is gonna
take awhile.

726
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,699
Cute pooch.

727
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,230
You know, when I was nine,
my parents gave me a dog,

728
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,436
this beautiful
Chesapeake Bay retriever.

729
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,502
One day I decided
to dock the dog's tail.

730
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,844
Dock,
what's that?

731
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,713
- Amputate.
- Why?

732
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,617
I just thought he'd look better.
I grabbed the butcher knife

733
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,644
from the kitchen
and just cut his tail off,

734
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,054
cropped his ears,
kept on going.

735
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,854
By the time
my folks got home,

736
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,555
they were pissed...
dead puppy everywhere.

737
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,892
Get your hands
off the dog.

738
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,761
- I'm kidding.
- I don't care,

739
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,596
get your hands
off my fucking dog.

740
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,329
Do what
he says, Jia.

741
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,437
Someday, Morales.

742
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,942
Someday.

743
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,274
Are you
protecting me now?

744
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,612
No, I just hate
that yellow scum fuck,

745
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,175
and I've got
a question to ask.

746
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,285
You've been tight
with Mukada, right?

747
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,722
Yeah, on and off.

748
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,749
- I was wondering something.
- What?

749
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,260
Where the fuck's
his office?

750
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,786
Open.

751
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,292
Enrique...

752
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,137
- what a surprise.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

753
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,145
Nice digs.

754
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,389
So?

755
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,566
I fried a guy once.

756
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,262
That's why I'm here.

757
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,100
I chucked his useless ass
into a transformer.

758
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,368
Now, he begged me
not to kill him.

759
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,967
I mean, that's what put me
over the edge, the begging.

760
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,302
So, now you're feeling
guilty about this.

761
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,939
Fuck, no.

762
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,348
I'm thinking,

763
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,478
I was the last guy
to hear this jag's voice.

764
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,115
I own his last words.

765
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,885
I'm not following.

766
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,019
I got a feeling you own my sister's,
and I want them.

767
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:15,157
Oh, well, yes, we did have a chat
shortly before the bus crashed.

768
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,962
She said that
she loved you very much

769
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,367
and that she was very excited
about seeing you.

770
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,234
And I couldn't wait
to see her.

771
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,537
I mean, her smiling face... she was
the spitting image of our mother.

772
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,099
Now you gotta
tell me, Father,

773
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,077
did Annette
at least die happy?

774
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,410
She seemed to be
in very good spirits,

775
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,314
except for the problems
that she was having in her marriage.

776
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,547
- She was having problems?
- Yeah, you didn't know about that?

777
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,385
No, what kind of problems?

778
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,052
Well, I'm not sure
of the specifics.

779
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:46,290
L-l... maybe you better
ask her husband.

780
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,195
Yeah.

781
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,660
Yeah, I'm gonna
do just that.

782
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,464
Damn, you look nicer
in here than you did out.

783
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,065
At least you still
look like shit.

784
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,268
It's been
a tough time,

785
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,471
planning the funeral
and all.

786
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,572
Yeah. Well, how you doing
about Annette?

787
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,209
Okay, I guess.

788
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,344
I mean, me and her,
we was...

789
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,549
Hey, hey, hey, I know.
She was a cunt.

790
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,028
Man, you don't know how happy I am
to hear you say that, Enrique.

791
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,190
I mean, I didn't want to come down
here and lie to you about Annette.

792
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,631
All of a sudden, she wanted
to be this model, right?

793
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,294
She was walking
around South Beach

794
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,963
and she's shoving
her tits in the face

795
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,767
of every agent
and photographer in town.

796
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,172
If she was spreading it around,
you gotta set her straight.

797
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,971
She kept wearing
these skimpy tops

798
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,841
no bigger than
fucking rubber bands.

799
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,311
- You know what I did?
- What?

800
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,409
I cut a fucking chunk
out of her arm.

801
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,910
- The bitch wore sleeves from then on.
- That put her right?

802
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,152
Fuck, no. The girl would spread
her legs for anything that moved,

803
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,921
and sometimes
for things that didn't.

804
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,825
I don't like
to disrespect the dead...

805
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,195
Hey, you know what, Javier?
You never will again.

806
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,298
My sister was a saint,
you motherfucker!

807
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,895
Son of a bitch!

808
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,170
- Fucker!
- Let him go!

809
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,405
- You motherfucker!
- Let him go!

810
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,174
You cocksucker!

811
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,396
Father?

812
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,701
Father Mukada?
Come here, please.

813
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,505
I heard that you'd been transferred
back from Benchley Memorial,

814
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,408
that you'll recover
from the stabbing.

815
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,276
Where's Hoyt?

816
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,110
Hoyt confessed
to a series of murders.

817
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,174
Today he's being
transported to death row.

818
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,242
Father, I...

819
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,255
I wanna make
confession as well.

820
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,187
I wanna be
a Roman Catholic again.

821
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,927
No.

822
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,624
What?

823
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,964
What do you...
you can't refuse me.

824
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,368
I sure as hell can.

825
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,964
Welcome to death row,
Hoyt.

826
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,178
In olden times, when you
wanted to know what the future held,

827
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,652
you'd drag your lamb down
to the local witchy woman,

828
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,178
where she'd proceed
to slice him neck to ass,

829
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,418
and read his hot,
steaming entrails.

830
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,155
From this, somehow,
your fortune was revealed,

831
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,857
from some woman
with cataracts and no teeth,

832
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,195
watching your livestock
bleed out.

833
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,701
Seems to me, all you've done
is lost a lamb,

834
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,534
which ain't gonna help
your fortune at all.

835
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,267
No!

836
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,571
Pig! You fucking pig!

837
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,338
No! No!

838
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,440
His violent episodes
are increasing.

839
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,850
Every day now he's getting
into some kind of brawl.

840
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,410
We can't just keep
sedating him.

841
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,217
Well, then get him
out of solitary.

842
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,315
It's making him go crazy.
Send him back to me.

843
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,690
Ryan, I tried.
The warden refuses.

844
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:07,561
- Why?
- Ryan, your brother killed Li Chen.

845
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,032
In self-defense,
he was gonna rape my ma.

846
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,501
But unfortunately,
you have no proof of that.

847
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,561
And Jia denies ever
having said that to you.

848
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,073
Fucking chink bastard.
Because of that cocksucker,

849
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,041
Cyril's facing
the death penalty now.

850
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,976
If only we could
find someone else

851
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,740
to corroborate
your story.

852
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,681
Oh, fuck,
wait, there is.

853
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,980
I've been so distracted,
I forgot, Glen Shupe.

854
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,316
He overheard Li
threatening my ma.

855
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,652
I'll go tell Leo.

856
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,296
You gotta handle it
so careful.

857
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:47,360
You know, you gotta treat it
like a piece of fine glass.

858
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,201
It's that fragile.

859
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,264
What is?

860
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,173
Happiness.

861
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,279
Did you or did you not
tell Ryan O'Reily

862
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,652
that Li Chen was gonna
rape O'Reily's mother?

863
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,782
I did not.

864
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,224
Take him back
to Emerald City.

865
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,159
I think I need to go
into protective custody.

866
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,457
Okay.

867
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,534
Leo, it's obvious
he's lying.

868
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:22,528
He did tell Ryan
about Li Chen.

869
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,939
Listen, it's not for me
to decide, Peter Marie.

870
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,533
That's the jury's job.

871
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,841
But you better explain
to Cyril O'Reily

872
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,780
that what he needs now
is a good lawyer.

873
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,908
Yeah, this is gonna
be a tough one.

874
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,614
The history of Cyril's
violent behavior,

875
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,087
the death
of Hamid Khan,

876
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:42,785
putting Jia Kenmin in a coma,
various other altercations.

877
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,556
That'll all play right
into the prosecution's hands.

878
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,621
And, Sister,
according to your analysis,

879
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,155
- he knows right from wrong.
- Yes.

880
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,033
Right, like I said...
this is gonna be tough.

881
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,897
- I'll take the case.
- You will?

882
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,933
But Mr. O'Reily,
if I were in your shoes,

883
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,003
I'd go with
a name brand.

884
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,015
Wait, what do you mean
a name brand?

885
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,313
A lawyer who can
razzle-dazzle,

886
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,617
someone who will turn
Cyril's mental state into a cause,

887
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,988
headlines, op-ed pieces,
segments on the nightly news.

888
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,585
- You can't do that?
- Not as well as others.

889
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,653
You need Barnum
and F. Lee Bailey,

890
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,687
Johnnie Cochran,
Ken Starr.

891
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,826
- Get real, those guys are expensive.
- Yes.

892
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,804
So, I guess the question
for you and your family is...

893
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,103
how much is your
brother's life worth?

894
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,812
- So, I'm the cause of all of this?
- No, you're not.

895
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,907
You tried to warn me something
could happen, and I didn't listen.

896
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,216
Don't blame yourself. Having you around
has been great for me and Cyril.

897
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,314
Now we gotta figure out
some way to get him off of death row.

898
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,520
Let's do what that woman said.
Let's hire a big-time attorney.

899
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,120
- You got money?
- Well, I've got some savings.

900
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,358
Well, whatever you have
is not gonna be enough.

901
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:58,266
Have you talked to your father,
to your Aunt Brenda?

902
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,998
- Why, what good would that do?
- Well, I'm not sure,

903
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,506
but they deserve
to know what's going on.

904
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,031
We need a family meeting.

905
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,203
You and Dad?
In the same room?

906
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,179
- Yes.
- Have you seen him lately?

907
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:13,148
No, I haven't seen
Seamus O'Reily for over 30 years,

908
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,083
but I can't think
of a better reason

909
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,813
to stare
the old bastard down.

910
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,449
I don't know.

911
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,397
Hey, Dad.

912
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,100
Aunt Brenda, hi.
How are you?

913
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,438
I brought
chocolate peanut clusters,

914
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,467
Cyril's favorite kind.

915
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,206
Oh, I'll make sure
he gets 'em, thanks.

916
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,543
Have a seat.

917
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,606
Suzanne.

918
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,049
Brenda.

919
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,521
For God's sake, Seamus,
we came all this way.

920
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,147
Take another
two steps.

921
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,317
I won't bite.

922
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,520
I promise.

923
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,825
Like you ever
kept a promise?

924
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,161
Let's get down
to business.

925
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,268
Okay, so I explained
the particulars

926
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,239
to the both of you
over the phone

927
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,900
and I just...
I need to know.

928
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:17,574
Can we afford to hire
the best lawyer to defend Cyril?

929
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,209
- Well, how much are we talking here?
- Upwards of 20,000.

930
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,549
Oh, sweet Jesus.

931
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,680
Neither one of us
have that kind of money,

932
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,282
not even if we stacked together
our nickels and dimes.

933
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:31,260
Aunt Brenda, I remember
when you got hurt on the job,

934
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,422
and the company, they cut you
a big, fat compensation check.

935
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,227
That's the money
I live on, Ryan.

936
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,793
I mean, that's all
I have for my old age.

937
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:43,169
Don't you be asking Brenda
to risk her future because of Cyril.

938
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,468
She says
she loves him.

939
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,408
- I do.
- But not enough.

940
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:50,379
Wait a minute. How come your mother
hasn't asked her family to step up?

941
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,746
You know as well as I
that my family disowned me.

942
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,343
Oh, that's right,
they disowned you.

943
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,321
But not for walking away
from your husband, your children, no.

944
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,153
For blowing up that cop.

945
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,682
For bringing shame
on your father,

946
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,524
the lace-curtain fuck!

947
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:10,158
I have accepted responsibility
for my actions, Seamus.

948
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,498
Maybe it's time
you did the same.

949
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,972
Hey, I took fucking responsibility
32 years ago!

950
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,600
By putting food
in their mouth,

951
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,769
paying the rent,
wiping their dirty asses!

952
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,972
And where were you,
where the fuck were you?!

953
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,538
Let me ask you
something, Seamus,

954
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,847
and tell me the truth
for the first time in your life.

955
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,615
You and Tessie got together
real quick after I left,

956
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,284
and you had Cyril
a year after we had Ryan.

957
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,761
- So?
- Were you fucking her behind my back?

958
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,592
Yeah.

959
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,031
In fact, I fucked her
the day Ryan was born.

960
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:47,230
Okay, enough!
Please.

961
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,403
We're talking
about Cyril here, okay?

962
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,777
You know...
I mean, shit,

963
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,748
we're talking
about saving his life.

964
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,877
I mean,
this shit don't matter.

965
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,649
- I mean...
- You're wrong, Ryan.

966
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,715
The shit
is all there is.

967
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:11,249
You say we have
to save him, for what?

968
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,854
A lifetime in Oz,

969
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:17,333
you know, with his mind
all a-smuddle?

970
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,768
Maybe the only
generous thing

971
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,897
we can all do
for the boy

972
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:25,635
is to let him die.

973
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,438
What?

974
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,344
Come on, Seamus,
give me a ride home.

975
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,815
No, no, Brenda,
please don't go.

976
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,215
Please?

977
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,482
There's more.

978
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,685
There has to be more
to a family than just blood, Ryan,

979
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:45,889
more than Christmas dinners
and the birthday cakes,

980
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,796
more than old hurts
and unsettled scores.

981
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,323
We're not a family.

982
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,836
We never have been.

983
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,601
You knocked on
the wrong door, honey.

984
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,207
See you in another
three decades, you cunt.

985
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:24,764
I'm so sorry
for that, l...

986
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,325
No, it's okay.

987
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,803
Actually, it went
better than I expected.

988
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,033
Oh, Jesus.

989
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,400
Oh, Ryan.

990
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:38,073
You know, she is wrong.
She's wrong,

991
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:42,448
because you and me and Cyril,
we are a family.

992
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,248
I mean, they were
tattered and torn,

993
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,517
but we're gonna
get through this.

994
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,385
Yeah, Aunt Brenda's right
about one thing, though.

995
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:59,092
The best thing we can do
for Cyril is to let him die.

996
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,838
Oh, shit.

997
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,694
Hiya, Ryan.

998
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,753
Hey, kid.

999
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,256
Whoa, whoa,
wait. Shh.

1000
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,327
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
- What happened?

1001
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,741
Was I bad again?

1002
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,337
Yeah.

1003
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,781
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1004
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:52,654
Can we go back
to Em City now?

1005
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,852
No, Cyril, I'm afraid you have
to go back to solitary.

1006
00:54:55,892 --> 00:55:00,226
- I don't like solitary.
- I know.

1007
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,061
- It's scary.
- I know.

1008
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,830
It's lonely.

1009
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,771
Believe me, if I could trade places
with you, I'd do it in a fucking second.

1010
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,843
Ryan?

1011
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,347
Are you crying?

1012
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,714
No.
Boys don't cry.

1013
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,084
That's right.

1014
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:28,716
Daddy always said,
"Boys don't cry."

1015
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,852
And Daddy knows best.

1016
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,159
Out of the way,
O'Reily.

1017
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,097
Are you gonna
behave yourself, hmm?

1018
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,225
Yes, sir.

1019
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,910
Listen...

1020
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,544
for all the gypsies,
seers, tea leaves,

1021
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,645
tarot cards,
and ouija boards,

1022
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,849
your life is
your fucking life.

1023
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,517
No, check that.

1024
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,790
There is one person
who tells the future for a living,

1025
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,627
and he's right
100% of the time.

1026
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,293
Who's this magical
motherfucker?

1027
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,030
He's called the judge.

1028
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,538
And all of us in Oz,

1029
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,666
we got our
fortunes told.
