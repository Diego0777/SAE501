1
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,557
Sigmund Freud said
that the purpose of our dreams

2
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,896
is to satisfy certain
instinctual urges

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,925
that society deems
unacceptable.

4
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,529
For instance, instead of killing
an oppressive father,

5
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,437
which would be
too horrible to handle,

6
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,772
we dream of throwing
our boss out the window.

7
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,539
Freud believed that the mind
will often modify

8
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,446
our dreams in order
to keep strong emotions at bay.

9
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,780
And with less emotion,
a man can get up,

10
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,842
go to work
and be a good citizen.

11
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,150
The difference for us in Oz is,
we don't dream

12
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,282
of throwing our boss out the window,
we actually do it.

13
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,769
So, Alvarez,

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,738
who's responsible?

15
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,673
- I wish I knew.
- You didn't see who stabbed you?

16
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,008
No. Everything happened
so fast, you know.

17
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,570
Then I guess my
investigation's over.

18
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,345
Yeah, that's really
breaking you up, ain't it?

19
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,553
There.

20
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,647
I'm no doctor, but...

21
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,126
I've seen a lot
of stab wounds in my time.

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,961
If that knife had gone in
another quarter of an inch to the left,

23
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,899
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

24
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,335
Quarter of an inch?
No shit.

25
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,430
No shit.

26
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,169
Guess you
were lucky, huh?

27
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,871
You wanna send me
back to solitary?

28
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,607
No, no, no.

29
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,411
I mean, there's no one
I'd rather see rot

30
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,781
in solitary than you,

31
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,251
but I figure

32
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,255
I'll send you
back to Em City.

33
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,280
Maybe next time

34
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,292
you're not so lucky.

35
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,125
Hmm.

36
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,873
Oh-ho.

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,606
- We gotta talk.
- Oh, you want me to shank you again?

38
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,410
Okay.

39
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,475
- Can I sit down?
- Blow me.

40
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,049
Get up.

41
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,492
Have a seat.

42
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,391
So?

43
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,733
You tried to kill me.

44
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,729
No, I didn't. You're alive,
ain't you? That was our deal.

45
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,833
You were supposed to stab me
in the shoulder.

46
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,572
Blade went in a quarter
of an inch from the heart.

47
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,878
Must've fucking moved, chocha.
What can I say?

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,214
Ain't gotta say nothing.

49
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,517
I just want you to know
that I know the truth, man.

50
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,921
I'm gonna honor
our agreement.

51
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,948
I didn't die.

52
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,961
I ain't gonna retaliate.

53
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,657
Backing off,
wise move, Miguel.

54
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,365
Listen to me carefully.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,131
I'm never gonna
welcome you back into El Norte,

56
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,139
but what I will do
is guarantee

57
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,336
- that we'll leave you be.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

58
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,402
All scores are settled.

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,116
Excuse me.

60
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,633
I want you
to shank me.

61
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,834
I don't know how you
came up with the idea,

62
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,435
but it fucking rocks,
and I see what it's done for you.

63
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,674
And mostly I see
how Morales is.

64
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,648
Him talking to you
before like

65
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,811
he's taking the high road,
being powerful and generous,

66
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,980
but behind his eyes,
he's running scared.

67
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,423
I want to follow you.

68
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,690
- You want to follow me?
- Join your gang.

69
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,892
You're the next wave,
and I want to be your lieutenant.

70
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,669
Shank me.

71
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,732
I ain't gonna
shank you, man.

72
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,541
But I understand, you think you gotta
prove yourself and shit, right?

73
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,206
Yes.

74
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,272
I'm gonna have you do
something else for me.

75
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,784
Anything.

76
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,811
Kill Guerra.

77
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,198
Step over here,
Morales.

78
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,866
Okay.

79
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,537
You know who I am?

80
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,138
Dave Brass,
the basketballer.

81
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,013
You played with McManus
against Vahue in those games.

82
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,610
You're pretty good
for a white boy.

83
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,849
Who cut my Achilles tendon?

84
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,255
I don't know.

85
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:36,625
Look, I don't care
whose idea it was.

86
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,130
All I want is the guy
who actually did the deed.

87
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,258
I wish I could
help you out.

88
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,495
You lying piece of shit.

89
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,403
You're gonna regret
that you didn't.

90
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,108
You know...

91
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,580
you had the sweetest
crossover dribble I've ever seen.

92
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,516
Juking right, then planting
that foot, then going left.

93
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,419
I don't know how many times
you dressed down Vahue with that move.

94
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,422
But you know
what they say...

95
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,656
you take away
a basketball guard's first step,

96
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,721
and all you got is a C.O.
With a broken wheel.

97
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,517
- What you doing?
- I've started a letter writing campaign

98
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,453
to protest the possible cancellation
of "Miss Sally's Schoolyard."

99
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,888
This one's signed
by Stanton.

100
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,087
- Yeah, he's a good guy, that Stanton.
- Stanton's in solitary.

101
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,527
All right,
so I fudged a few.

102
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,090
Wangler, Adebisi...

103
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,034
- Groves. Groves?
- Okay, I fudged them all.

104
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,004
None of those yerds out there
would rally for the cause.

105
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,531
- You want to write one?
- No offense,

106
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,476
but the only thing
I want renewed

107
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,843
is my grandson's chance
to beat his leukemia.

108
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,281
Right. Sorry. What's the latest
on his condition?

109
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,946
You gotta pay to play.
There's a cure to be found,

110
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,887
but it'll cost,
and I still haven't

111
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,947
figured out a way
to raise the money.

112
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,790
Next is Whitney Allen,
star of "Miss Sally's Schoolyard,"

113
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,889
to tell us about next week's
Mightyball drawing. Whitney.

114
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,924
- Hi, Warren. How are you?
- Very well. Thanks for dropping by...

115
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,403
Who are all these numbnuts
that play the lottery?

116
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,996
- I've played the lottery.
- Me too.

117
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,442
Like I said, numbnuts. Out of 51,
you gotta pick the right number,

118
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,707
not once,
but six times in a row.

119
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,805
- I say it is possible to win.
- Jesus Christ,

120
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,544
you'd have a better chance
of getting struck by lightning.

121
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,449
Approximately
1,000 people a year

122
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,886
win $1 million or more
in North American lotteries.

123
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,358
In contrast, less than 100 people
a year are hit by lightning.

124
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,917
...$2 million,
so don't forget to play,

125
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,725
because the winner
might just be you.

126
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,564
- Excuse me, Officer Brass.
- Yeah?

127
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,472
Bob Rebadow.

128
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,103
You've always seemed
like a sympathetic fellow to me.

129
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,612
What do you want?

130
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,979
I want you to purchase
a lottery ticket for me.

131
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,213
The jackpot is $2 million.
I'll cut you in.

132
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,983
- Cut me in on what?
- The prize money.

133
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,950
What in the world makes you
think you're gonna win?

134
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,485
God told me.

135
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,862
These are
the winning numbers.

136
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,443
Hey, Dave,
how you doing?

137
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,346
What's the deal with this guy,
Bob Rebadow?

138
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,078
Ahh, nothing.
Why, is he giving you trouble?

139
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,053
No. I just thought
the guy might be psychotic.

140
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,319
At dinner he starts telling me
God speaks to him.

141
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,758
Oh, yeah. He's had
an ongoing tête-a-tête

142
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,694
with the Almighty
for some time now.

143
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,720
Actually
he's relatively stable.

144
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,866
First time I've touched
one of these since...

145
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,631
my Achilles got cut.

146
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,537
It's a perfect fucking ball,
man... gummy, beat up.

147
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:11,669
Give you mad handle. This ball
will make you Pete Maravich.

148
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,975
Oh, Jesus,
Pistol Pete.

149
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,278
Greatest scorer in the history
of college ball.

150
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,648
When he was growing up,
he used to carry a ball

151
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,653
with him at all times,
no matter what.

152
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,917
In school, on a date,
didn't matter.

153
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,392
He'd even go to bed
with a basketball, like a marriage.

154
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,691
So I started doing it.
I quit sleeping with it

155
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,130
when I got to college,
but other than that...

156
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,833
- Come on. You want to shoot, shoot.
- It's all right.

157
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,273
- I can stick around for a while.
- I gotta go.

158
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,403
Got to make an extra stop on my
way home. I gotta buy a lottery ticket.

159
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,777
Well, another night then.

160
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,078
We'll stay late,
we'll shoot around.

161
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,652
You know how
Pete Maravich died?

162
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,416
Playing basketball.

163
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,047
Had been retired
eight years.

164
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,253
Was out running in a pickup game,
heart attack,

165
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,558
up and down the court one minute,
falling over dead the next.

166
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:09,227
Till death do us part.
He's able to live that, literally.

167
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,837
But I won't be able to.

168
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,099
So stop
fucking asking me

169
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,704
to shoot around
with you, all right?

170
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,345
Hey!

171
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,889
First of all, let me say
I'm glad you're fully recovered.

172
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,223
Secondly, I understand
you want to return to Emerald City.

173
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:39,254
And you can understand that
that's a tough call for me.

174
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,199
Before you got... hurt,

175
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:47,103
you continuously threatened the lives
of Morales and the other Latinos,

176
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,438
and plus,
Cyril O'Reily's in there.

177
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,603
Mr. McManus,

178
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,670
getting hit by Cyril O'Reily

179
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,114
may have been the single
greatest event in my life.

180
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,878
There I was
on the brink of death,

181
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,977
and suddenly I could see
all that I had done.

182
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,989
And more importantly,
if I survived,

183
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,321
all that I could do.

184
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,020
Have you ever had
an experience like that?

185
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,653
Well, yes, I have.

186
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,028
Whether or not you
bring me back to Em City

187
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,625
is ultimately
irrelevant,

188
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,636
and yet
I'm drawn there.

189
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,197
Why? I don't know.

190
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,038
All right,
let's give it a shot.

191
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,068
But I want you to have interaction
sessions with Peter Marie.

192
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,680
I'm sorry I hurt you.

193
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,745
Why did you
hit Kenmin, Cyril?

194
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,553
He was punching Ryan.

195
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,992
Why were you
punching Ryan?

196
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,552
I'd been in the cage all day.

197
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,031
I was feeling feisty.

198
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,558
- I decided to show off. It was stupid.
- Yeah.

199
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,332
- Ryan.
- What?

200
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,467
His bullshit almost got Cyril transferred to
the insane asylum.

201
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,603
The rules are no interrupting
and no swearing.

202
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,849
I take full blame for everything
that's happened to me.

203
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,786
Which is why
I want to make peace.

204
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,991
Uh, uh, uh,
sit the fuck down.

205
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,760
No. I want
to make peace too.

206
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,037
Go ahead.

207
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,239
Oh fuck.

208
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,552
Prisoner #02L333:
Li Chen:

209
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,654
Convicted
January 14th, 2002:

210
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,631
Four counts
of attempted murder:

211
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,361
Sentence: 32 years:
Up for parole in 20.

212
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,261
Okay.

213
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,069
- Stop laughing, Ryan.
- Ryan, behave.

214
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,544
I know, okay, okay, I'm sorry,
but Cyril's singing really sucks.

215
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,014
Now I have told you that this program
is not about becoming Pavarotti.

216
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,279
It's about learning how to express
your feelings through the music.

217
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,149
- You did very good, Cyril.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,815
- That's more like Pava-rotten.
- All right, you try.

219
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,758
Huh-uh, no, no.
The deal was I sign up for this class

220
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,489
to spend more time with you.
That's it. I'm not singing.

221
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,656
So this session is over,

222
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,825
but next Friday, Ryan,
I want to hear you sing.

223
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,734
Okay, Mom, but you know what?
I'll do you one better.

224
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,170
Suzanne, your next
two students are here.

225
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,173
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's this?

226
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,175
I heard your mother
was teaching,

227
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,268
so I decided
to give it a whirl.

228
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,849
- Jia Kenmin.
- Suzanne Fitzgerald.

229
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,046
- Li Chen.
- Welcome, both of you.

230
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,988
- Let's go, O'Reily.
- Yeah, yeah, in a second, Brass.

231
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,820
- Now, fuckwad.
- Get your hands off...

232
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,758
Bye, guys.

233
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,093
So, have you had
any experience...

234
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,591
- What's the matter, Ryan?
- I got a bad feeling, man.

235
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,832
- About what?
- About that piss stain, Jia Kenmin.

236
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,238
I know he's perpetrating, I know
he's plotting something against us.

237
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,573
And l... I think he might
want to hurt my ma.

238
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,738
- I like her.
- Yeah, well, she likes you too, Cyril.

239
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,408
You want to trade?

240
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,350
Trade? Trade what?

241
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,453
I'll give you my most prized
possession if you give me her.

242
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,967
We don't have to trade.
We can share her. You know that.

243
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,060
- Really?
- Yeah. Hey,

244
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,128
don't I share
everything with you?

245
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,905
Hey, Jia.

246
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,245
Your mother's
a wonderful person.

247
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,772
- Let's see that she stays that way.
- Meaning what?

248
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,184
You fuck with her, you go back
into a coma. This time it's permanent.

249
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,189
Look, you have nothing
to fear from me.

250
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,224
But Li Chen,
he's a different matter.

251
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,024
He's one sick fuck.

252
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,264
You're dreaming,

253
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,640
you're deep into REM sleep
and someone walks in,

254
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,872
someone who's dead,

255
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,212
someone you love,
a father, a mother, a friend,

256
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,980
and you're happy to see
that person alive and well,

257
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,682
happy to have a conversation to say
things you never got a chance to say.

258
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,657
But then you wake up

259
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,353
and the person you loved
is still dead

260
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,488
and you get to mourn
all over again.

261
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,503
About fucking time.

262
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,279
What happened
to the pool table?

263
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,549
Hey. It's in dry-dock
for repairs.

264
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,288
Spread the word, I want
a meeting of the entire brotherhood.

265
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,386
We got some unfinished business
with Chucky Pancamo.

266
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,196
Hey, Petey.
What's shaking, man?

267
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,829
Schillinger's
out of Ad Seg.

268
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,272
So when they letting you
out of here?

269
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,674
I don't know.
Dr. Nathan won't say.

270
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,372
- Things cool with Morales?
- Yeah, yeah.

271
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,904
- Drugs running the same as always.
- The kitchen?

272
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,281
Good.
It's under control.

273
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,651
Hey, Petey, don't get used
to running things.

274
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,179
- I'm still fucking breathing.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

275
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,193
But we gotta waste Schillinger
for what he did to you, you know.

276
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,196
We'll take care of that Nazi fuck
when I'm back in circulation,

277
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,289
- Capisce?
- Yep, capisce.

278
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,396
I got news.

279
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,296
Schillinger's
out of the hole.

280
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,100
Good.

281
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,772
Now we can sit back
and watch the Nazis

282
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,713
wipe out the Sicilians.

283
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,717
Yeah, but that ain't gonna do
nothing about them spics.

284
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,742
You know they
as strong as ever,

285
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,880
and you know Morales is gonna
keep his pact with Pancamo.

286
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,653
Unless Morales sees this

287
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,627
as an opportunity to move
three squares forward,

288
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,493
change partners.

289
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:30,491
I want you to tell Enrique
I want to sit down.

290
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,506
The older I get,
the more I realize

291
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,418
that my appetites
are merely habits.

292
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,751
I don't crave power
anymore.

293
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,519
I just want it
'cause I always had it.

294
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,050
When I first arrived
here at Emerald City,

295
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,291
you made me a very generous offer
to share in the drug trade,

296
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,858
but I ain't used
to partners so I said no.

297
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,870
Ever since then, we've been rattling
the sabers at each other,

298
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,134
with neither one of us
gaining very much ground.

299
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,437
I'm beginning to think
you don't know how to die.

300
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,905
Oh, Christ, what's this now?
I'm gonna shut them down.

301
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,678
No, no, wait. Signal your men
to get ready, but let's wait.

302
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,378
I'm missing
the point here.

303
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,786
Months ago we
agreed to a truce.

304
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,883
Only thing is, neither one of us
meant the oaths that we swore.

305
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,054
I say we make
the lie a reality.

306
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,328
I say we work
together.

307
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,858
Peace.

308
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,639
Well, I'll be fucked.

309
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,511
All it means, Tim, is now
they're one big happy tit factory.

310
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,914
Not when Pancamo
finds out.

311
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,711
Fuck.

312
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,655
We gotta talk
to Chucky.

313
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,590
Fuck Chucky.
I can handle this.

314
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,117
- Petey.
- My father ran operations here.

315
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,494
- I run operations here.
- Adebisi took you down, man.

316
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,396
That was
Pancamo's fault.

317
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,300
Okay, that motherfucker was supposed
to be watching my back

318
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,169
- and he did fucking shit.
- So what the fuck are we gonna do?

319
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,910
We'll show these assholes
the Sicilians are still in charge.

320
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,674
We're gonna massacre
the fucking Nazis.

321
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,704
- Where's Said?
- Why?

322
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,718
Because I want
reinforcements.

323
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,190
I need a brief conversation
with Minister Said.

324
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,132
Excuse me.

325
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,433
May I sit?

326
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,099
- I'll come right to the point.
- Please do.

327
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,769
Me and you, we have mutual interests,
common enemies.

328
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,438
I want him dented
and you want him dented

329
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,811
and I'm hoping we can
work something out.

330
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,374
You were raped
by Adebisi.

331
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,080
Yeah, well, I'm asking...

332
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,678
I'm answering.

333
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,986
You may have resolved
the rape in your own head.

334
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,686
It doesn't change the facts.
Here in Oz,

335
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,288
you will always be known
as one of Adebisi's bitches.

336
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,027
No matter what you do,
you cannot change that.

337
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,366
No. I can.

338
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,606
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

339
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,277
Peter?

340
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,613
What?

341
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,551
He's fucking right,
you know.

342
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,852
And we, well,
you're our paisan,

343
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,121
but we decided we're not
going after the Aryans

344
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,152
unless Pancamo
gives the word.

345
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,563
Fuck all of youse.

346
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,108
Hey!
What can I do for you?

347
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,049
- Came to pick up the pool table.
- Yeah, is it fixed yet?

348
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,815
The ball return was a little hinky,
but I unhinkied it.

349
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,221
Hey! You got
the toaster done?

350
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,556
Hold your Calvins, bocce boy.
I'm in the middle of something.

351
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:19,223
Yeah, well, I got lunch coming,
so these jokers can wait.

352
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,631
- We don't wait for wops.
- Someone's gonna teach you manners.

353
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,567
Yeah, well, it ain't
gonna be you, prag.

354
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,831
Oh, look out!

355
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,179
Get the fuck off!

356
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,184
No, let me up!

357
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,914
- You know, I always wondered...
- Let me up!

358
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,514
Was Adebisi's dick
bigger than mine?

359
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,584
Fuck you!

360
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,290
Fuck you! No!

361
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,265
- You be the judge.
- No!

362
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,633
I managed to stop the bleeding,
but he's still in pretty bad shape.

363
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,903
Take him to the psych ward.

364
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,511
Oh, yeah. Pool table's
working good now.

365
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,988
Have you been working
for the warden for a long time?

366
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,895
Not that long,
but long enough.

367
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,866
I'm the one who saved
Glynn's life, you know?

368
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,199
Mm-hmm. 'Cause when Clayton Hughes
was gonna stab him,

369
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,671
I grabbed Hughes
and I pulled him off.

370
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,867
Oh.

371
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,468
- You're very pretty.
- Thank you.

372
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,948
L... I've been in solitary
for almost a year,

373
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,010
and you're the first real woman
I've seen since I got out.

374
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,683
- Real woman?
- Well, there's... you know, there's...

375
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,216
- the female hacks.
- Penders, come in.

376
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,658
- Okay, bye.
- Now!

377
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,564
Close the door.

378
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,540
What can I do for you?

379
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,016
Well, I'm out of solitary
and I want to stay out,

380
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,679
so I think the best thing
for me to do is to avoid any...

381
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,689
altercations.

382
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:28,022
Which means as little face time
with the other prisoners as possible.

383
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,755
So I want to know if,
instead of working in the shop,

384
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,888
- if you can give me a job here.
- In my office?

385
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,057
- Yes.
- No.

386
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,659
- Warden, that...
- Don't say I owe you.

387
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,726
I have a very negative
reaction to that.

388
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,933
Your presence here would only
remind me on a day-to-day basis

389
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:46,069
of what happened to Clayton Hughes.
So the answer is no.

390
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:49,478
In fact, if you
see me coming, hide,

391
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,745
because the best thing for me
is to stick you back in solitary.

392
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,720
Stay out of my sight.
Okay? Officer!

393
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,349
Warden, that's not right.
That's not right.

394
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,086
- Bye.
- That's not right.

395
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,462
Wet dreams are the best.

396
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,761
You start having them
at like 12 years old.

397
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,562
Every other night
you're making love

398
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,535
to the most beautiful
women in the world...

399
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,936
Pam Grier,
Barbi Benton,

400
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,408
even the lovely little Jodie Jensen
in your fifth grade home room.

401
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,240
Then you grow up and the wet dreams
happen less frequently,

402
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,746
but now you're getting
the real thing, so who cares?

403
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,682
Until one day you realize
the woman that you're with,

404
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,413
maybe even married to,
don't look like Barbi Benton,

405
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,387
ain't fucking
like Pam Grier,

406
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,913
and will never love you
as purely and innocently

407
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,791
as little Jodie Jensen.
Wet dreams...

408
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,761
a boy don't know how good
he's got it.

409
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,493
This new law brings
the death penalty

410
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,264
back to our state and limits
a condemned man's choices

411
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,431
to either lethal injection
or the electric chair.

412
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,806
And I'm confident
that this version

413
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,243
will sustain
all judicial review.

414
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,680
And once again, our message
to miscreants is clear:

415
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,708
Stop murdering our families.

416
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,947
Stop the violence.

417
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,947
Tobias, would you
like to sit here?

418
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,693
No, why?

419
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,822
You're gonna hurt your neck
straining like that.

420
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,025
It's just...

421
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,728
Keller's coming back
from Cedar Junction today.

422
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,464
We know.

423
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,473
I haven't seen him in months.
I'm a little... anxious.

424
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,498
- How do I look?
- Anxious.

425
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,340
I was hoping you
were gonna say fuckable.

426
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,307
Misdeal.

427
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,711
Warden, I'm touched you came down
to welcome me home.

428
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,190
Where's the red carpet
and the marching band?

429
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,955
- Cut the jokes, Keller.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,189
You know, I want you to know
this time around

431
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,993
I intend to be
a model prisoner.

432
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,466
Gonna be the best-behaved man
in Emerald City.

433
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,595
That'd be fine, except you're not
going to Emerald City.

434
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,901
No?
Where? B?

435
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,840
For the time being,
you'll be in protective custody.

436
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,970
Protective custody?
Why?

437
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,071
You'll see.

438
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,981
After he changes clothes take him
to interview room two.

439
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,499
Well, well, well.
Agent Taylor, what a surprise.

440
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,330
Sit.

441
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,004
I've been riding hump all day.
I prefer to stand.

442
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,269
Suit yourself.

443
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,606
State of Massachusetts
let you out of prison

444
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:36,273
because Gaetano Cincetta
says you didn't hire him to kill Hank.

445
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,841
He says Chucky Pancamo
hired him.

446
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,785
- That's old news, spanky.
- True.

447
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,289
But one question though:

448
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,349
Why would you confess
to hiring Cincetta when you didn't?

449
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,486
Why would you cover
for Pancamo?

450
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,587
- I owed him.
- You're lying.

451
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,894
Prove it.

452
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,399
I do have one piece of new news
for you, though.

453
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,802
The Bryce Tibbetts
murder case.

454
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,532
A witness has
come forward.

455
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,809
Imagine that.
After all this time,

456
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,544
a citizen decides to step up
and do the right thing.

457
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,382
This citizen

458
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,718
picked your picture
out of a mug file.

459
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,781
Tomorrow you and I
are gonna drive into town

460
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,793
and see whether he or she
can pick you out of a lineup.

461
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,891
In the meantime,
we're keeping you isolated.

462
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,297
But don't get
too comfortable though.

463
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,768
Your real home's
gonna be death row.

464
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,333
Officer, put this...
caviar on ice.

465
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,472
Put an "X" on that one.

466
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,483
- Hey.
- Hey.

467
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,046
- How'd your meeting go with Rudolph?
- Good.

468
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,149
We're feeling very positive
about his parole.

469
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,025
- Excellent.
- Well, I mean...

470
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,029
I said that before,
didn't I?

471
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,925
Will you stop beating
yourself up, Catherine?

472
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,402
You did the best
you could for me.

473
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,632
I... have to go.
Come here.

474
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,644
Give Daddy a kiss.

475
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,578
I love you.

476
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,677
- Will you give daddy a kiss?
- Yes.

477
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,852
Mmm, you smell good. I'll see you
on Saturday, okay, dumpling?

478
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,657
Bye.

479
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,569
So, Officer Howell...

480
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,398
you and me gonna be spending
an awful lot of time together, huh?

481
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,603
Think you can
handle that, tough guy?

482
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,169
I know if I can't,
you'll make me.

483
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,016
- Sister Pete.
- Hello, Chris.

484
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,382
May we speak privately?

485
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,252
Knock yourself out,
Sister.

486
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,956
- How are you?
- Off balance.

487
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,794
Yesterday I was
in Cedar Junction

488
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,594
serving life
on a murder for hire

489
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,034
and all of a sudden they tell me,
"Oh, you're not guilty for that.

490
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,698
You're going back to Oz."
I'm on the bus,

491
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,503
I'm looking forward
to coming back here and the FBI

492
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,739
tells me that they got a witness
against me for an old murder rap.

493
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm facing
the death penalty.

494
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,913
What you need
is a good lawyer.

495
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,046
Yeah, you know of any?

496
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,250
I'll find somebody.

497
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,091
If you need anything else,
give me a holler.

498
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,959
Sister Pete?

499
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,769
I want to spend
some time with Beecher.

500
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,668
I'll see what I can do.

501
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,105
The death penalty?

502
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,738
- Christ.
- I'm hoping Catherine McClain

503
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,941
will recommend a lawyer
from her office.

504
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,217
Catherine, yeah,
that's a good idea.

505
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,983
Meanwhile, I'll ask the warden
about all the specifics.

506
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,457
While you're there,
will you ask him...

507
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,654
I'd like some time
with Keller.

508
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,789
I'll see
what I can do.

509
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,925
- The answer is no.
- May I ask why?

510
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,198
You can ask, but you
won't like the reason.

511
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,570
- Try me.
- Chris Keller tortured,

512
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,235
sexually abused
and murdered three men.

513
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,540
Why should I try
to make him happy?

514
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,239
And Beecher?

515
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,545
Beecher is once again the victim
of someone else's excesses.

516
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,211
- Oh, come on.
- This discussion is over.

517
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,154
- Leo!
- This discussion is over!

518
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,502
You know when you're
driving in your car

519
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,473
or maybe taking a shower and suddenly
you remember some great dream you had

520
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,533
and that dream made you feel
so good or bad or whatever,

521
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,909
you can't help but try
to recapture every detail?

522
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,211
Next thing you know, you missed
your exit or the hot water's gone cold.

523
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,843
Well, in Oz,
if you take a shower

524
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,046
and you space off,
even for a second,

525
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,852
some cocksucker is sure
to shank you in the back.

526
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,222
Daydreams can be deadly.

527
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,501
What do you want?

528
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,804
What do you want?

529
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,971
Not a thing.

530
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,913
Not a thing.

531
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,850
Hmph.

532
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,944
Robson,
get out of my way.

533
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,047
Robson,
get out of my way.

534
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,184
- Imam, come with us.
- Say another word, Robson.

535
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,957
Say one more word,

536
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,124
I'll snap your cracker neck
right here, right now.

537
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,900
Move your sorry ass
onward.

538
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,300
Yes, sir, boss.

539
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,344
Imam,

540
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,679
you have to control
the anger in your heart.

541
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,845
- Remember the words of Allah.
- What words would those be, Arif?

542
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,685
What advice
would Allah have for me?

543
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,260
Look, I don't mean to speak
beyond my position,

544
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,702
but he has got serious...

545
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,729
I know what you're
thinking, Ahmad,

546
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,435
but Minister Said
is a great man.

547
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,569
He's having
troubles right now,

548
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,704
that is why we
must not abandon him.

549
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,511
No, no, not abandon him.
Of course not, he's our brother.

550
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,484
But is he the one to lead us?

551
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,146
- Look, I feel that he has got...
- Enough!

552
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,146
Help me pick
up these beads.

553
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,726
- Did you ever use drugs?
- No, ma'am.

554
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,358
Not so much as a marijuana cigarette
has ever touched my lips.

555
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,595
I have.

556
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,798
Heroin,
crack cocaine.

557
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,740
- Kareem?
- What?

558
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,243
You thought my journey
to Allah was easy?

559
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,904
No, it's just that-that...

560
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,938
when I was using,
you never said...

561
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,678
That is a period of my life of which
I am not very proud of.

562
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,209
Hmm.
Unlike now?

563
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,299
- Follow me.
- Yo, man, what's up with that?

564
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,933
- "Miss Sally" is on the TV, man.
- I said come.

565
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,783
- What were you doing with Poet?
- Poet? What... nothing.

566
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,947
- He wasn't trying to sell you drugs?
- Come on, man.

567
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,253
Only titties we were talking about
was Miss Sally's.

568
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,851
You are not to talk to him.

569
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,954
Why? What's up? We just snapping.
That's my boy, we go back.

570
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,659
What'd I just say?
Now remember,

571
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,396
one word from me to McManus
and you go straight back to solitary.

572
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,031
Now go.

573
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,509
- Straighten out your cell.
- Say what?

574
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,171
Hey!

575
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,373
Now you better
obey me.

576
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:45,130
Oh, dude, you look like
you need some bounce, bro'.

577
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,569
A shitload of tits
came in today.

578
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,234
Step off, bro'. You know
I can't be doing no drugs and shit.

579
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,903
Motherfucker Said's
watching me 24/7, man.

580
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,311
Glynn having me tested
once a week and shit.

581
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,316
Well, yo, last year
Glynn was having me tested, man.

582
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,410
I got the way around that.
You know Billy Plana?

583
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,284
- Huh-uh.
- He works bedpan.

584
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,849
He'd piss for me then
switched the cups out.

585
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,156
You could pay, right?

586
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,186
Well, he'd piss for me,
he'd piss for you.

587
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,801
All right, hook me up.

588
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,928
- I got you, dawg.
- Omar?

589
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,804
- Oh fuck, fuck.
- Omar.

590
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,837
Oh, man.

591
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,871
- Open your hand.
- Yeah, I was just...

592
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,077
Be quiet.

593
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,642
Open your hand.

594
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,118
Give it to me.

595
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,591
Damn!

596
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,767
You forget
Omar White exists.

597
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,608
I'm not gonna
warn you again, Poet.

598
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,406
- Fuck this shit, man.
- Yo, yo, yo. Hold it, man.

599
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,709
My gap, man.
Fuck, he got my money.

600
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,454
I should be working and shit,
you know what I mean?

601
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,888
Omar didn't actually
take a hit?

602
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,123
- No.
- Well good.

603
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,759
But he will. He'll find another dealer...
by day's end he'll be high.

604
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,599
Well, yeah.
All right.

605
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,902
- Let me know if he uses.
- McManus!

606
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,635
That's all
you have to say?

607
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,507
Well, what do you
want me to say?

608
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,172
Wait a minute,
you asked me to help White.

609
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,840
- You asked me to save him.
- Yeah.

610
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,851
In the process, you convinced me
that if I can turn him around,

611
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,853
I might find a way past
my own troubles.

612
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,617
- Mm-hmm.
- I bought in, McManus.

613
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,523
I bought in hook,
line and sinker.

614
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,992
I'm still buying.

615
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,190
Now I need this to succeed,
for my own soul.

616
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,993
I know.

617
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,933
- So why you refusing to help me?
- I'm not refusing anything.

618
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,994
I got nothing to offer.
Said, this is all on you.

619
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,905
Omar White is the million
dollar question.

620
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,637
There's an answer,
but I'm never gonna come up with it.

621
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,773
I believe you can.
I'm basically a spectator now,

622
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,579
but I think your instincts
can find the key.

623
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,950
And if not,
we're all fucked.

624
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,827
Omar, when you finish up...

625
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,531
come see me.

626
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,062
Yo, man, look.

627
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,634
You're making my motherfucking head
hurt, all right?

628
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,111
I don't feel like hearing
no goddamn drug speech now. Shit!

629
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,171
- We're not gonna talk about drugs.
- Then what?

630
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,342
I don't know... anything.
Just a conversation.

631
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,878
Look, I don't want to have no damn
conversation now, all right? Shit.

632
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,223
We're gonna have
a conversation anyway.

633
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,922
You understand me?

634
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,660
Now what is your
favorite color?

635
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,999
- Answer.
- White.

636
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,199
White. Why is that?
'Cause of your name, right?

637
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,605
Huh-uh.

638
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,667
It's clean and shit.

639
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,805
Fine.
One more.

640
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:21,113
What was the last thing
that you were really passionate about?

641
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,383
Tell you the truth, man, I don't think
I ever gave a shit about shit.

642
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,155
Oh, come on, man.
There must've been something.

643
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,254
Come on, something you wanted
to do, something you wanted to be.

644
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,027
Come on, Omar. Give me something.
Give me something.

645
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,599
A cowboy.

646
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,439
Yeah, that's right, a motherfucking
black cowboy, Jack, yeah.

647
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,410
When I was a kid,
you know, I saw...

648
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,245
I saw this movie from the olden days
and shit, with...

649
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,250
Herb Jeffries in it.

650
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,479
Yeah, it was called

651
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,919
"The Bronze Buckaroo"
and shit. That's it.

652
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,684
Black B-westerns.

653
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,748
Black movies,
all black cowboys

654
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,953
made for black audiences
in the late '30s.

655
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,890
So guns and horses, huh?

656
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,101
Yo, man, never mind the motherfucking
guns and horses.

657
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,436
That motherfucker
Herb Jeffries...

658
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,207
he could sing.

659
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,236
So this is excellent.

660
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,340
- What's... what's excellent?
- You've identified an interest,

661
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,011
and that's an important
step forward.

662
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,545
Finding the right activity,
a constructive way of spending time,

663
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,048
can make all the difference. I'm gonna
set up a meeting with Fitzgerald.

664
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,256
- O'Reily's mother?
- She's doing community service here.

665
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:42,493
- Why am I meeting who?
- She teaches singing.

666
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:46,230
Yo, that all sounds great
and shit except for one thing...

667
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,569
- I can't sing.
- "Can't" never did anything, Omar.

668
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,598
What does that mean?

669
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,169
I don't understand. You're pissed
because we've started a music program?

670
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,010
No. No, I'm pissed
because I'm just hearing about it.

671
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,141
I'm the state liaison,
for Christ's sake.

672
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,449
Oh, and you have to report everything
back to your pal the governor.

673
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,256
Leo, there's no money in the budget
for a music program.

674
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,157
How do you expect
to pay the freight?

675
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,594
Well, Suzanne Fitzgerald
is donating her time.

676
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,155
The other costs are minimal.
I'll do what I always do...

677
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,133
take a little from here,
a little from there.

678
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,260
The arts are an important
part of life.

679
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:22,932
Oh really? I couldn't get you
anywhere near a theater or art gallery

680
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,067
when we were married,
especially if there was football on TV.

681
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,978
Ellie, I really think this program
can help some of these guys.

682
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,142
Tim, you're setting yourself
up for another fall.

683
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,481
You always bet everything
on the impossible.

684
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,453
- That's not true.
- Yeah?

685
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,353
Look at us.

686
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,052
Get an estimate
of the cost.

687
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,789
I'll see if I can wrangle
some cash from Devlin.

688
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,727
You were very smart
in marrying her.

689
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,262
Hmm.

690
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,707
She was very smart
in divorcing you.

691
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,880
- So l... I ain't got to sing?
- No, you don't have to sing.

692
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,745
I don't?

693
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,843
But I do encourage you to try
at least once before we give up.

694
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,183
No.

695
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,486
My voice, it ain't no good.
I mean, it's too deep.

696
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,517
Like Barry White,
you know, just bad.

697
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,291
You know what? I think
you might be more of a tenor,

698
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,526
so let's try this.

699
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,099
You try.

700
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,840
You know, um...

701
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,774
you sure are
a fine-looking woman.

702
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,278
Okay. Well...

703
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,042
new idea.
Let's...

704
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,381
let's try starting
with a song, okay?

705
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,976
I'll bet you know
this one.

706
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,682
? Jesus loves me,
this I know?

707
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:50,217
? For the Bible
tells me so?

708
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,787
? Little ones
to him belong?

709
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,493
- ? They are weak but he is strong.?
- I know that.

710
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,763
That's... that's...
that's "Jesus Loves Me."

711
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,327
? Yes, Jesus loves me?

712
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,806
? Yes, Jesus loves me?

713
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,241
? Yes, Jesus loves me?

714
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,211
? The Bible tells me so.?

715
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,874
See, now you... you...
you a singer.

716
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,383
It's your turn.

717
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,415
I heard...

718
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,787
I heard you was O'Reily's moms?

719
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,792
That's true.

720
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,392
Growing up,

721
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,594
- you make him sing too?
- No.

722
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,397
Why not?

723
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,233
It's a long story.

724
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,540
So is mine.

725
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,009
Omar, you know, I'm not
asking for the world...

726
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,569
Damn!

727
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,707
I mean, I try to be graceful
up here, right? I'm trying, all right?

728
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,683
You said I didn't have
to sing, right?

729
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,346
I said I wanted you to try.
Now sit back down, please.

730
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,515
Motherfucking liar, man.
Everybody always fucking lying!

731
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,253
Officer Brass!

732
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:59,262
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,127
I'm sorry. I take it back.
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,497
I take it back. Forgive me,
I didn't mean to get angry.

735
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,502
Suzanne,
you all right?

736
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,902
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Shh, shh, shh.

737
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:11,271
- It's okay.
- Get off the floor, you fucking mutt!

738
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,037
Stand up.

739
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,908
Let's try again.
Come on.

740
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,810
Sit down.

741
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,077
Come on.

742
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,015
Want to try this?

743
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,354
I heard once that every person
in your dream is actually you.

744
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,921
Even if you're dreaming about you
and some motherfucker you can't stand,

745
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,795
you're actually
dreaming about you

746
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,700
and the motherfucker part
of yourself you can't stand.

747
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,240
Your mother got all riled up
about civil rights.

748
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,845
Hell, things wasn't as bad
as they was in the South.

749
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,580
But she dragged your daddy
on down to D.C.

750
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:56,245
To hear Dr. King,
to join the march.

751
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,880
- You didn't go?
- No.

752
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,748
I stayed in town waiting
on something better to come along.

753
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,326
Your parents were
part of the most

754
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:11,232
important event
of the 20th Century,

755
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,760
and here I am, two days
into a five-day drunk.

756
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:18,297
I miss Mama
so fuckin' much.

757
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,833
I know, I know.

758
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,345
I got a postcard
from my honey.

759
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,181
- She's in Maui.
- Oh yeah, Maui? Maui's awesome.

760
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,915
You know you can actually
climb down into a volcano there?

761
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,219
And the women,
they got great, great...

762
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,292
They got great
inner beauty, man.

763
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,319
- You been to Maui?
- I read it in "National Pornographic."

764
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,195
Lots of color photos
and shit.

765
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:46,464
Does it bother you that your girlfriend
is in Hawaii, Chico?

766
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,063
No, I know Consuela
still loves me

767
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,700
and I want her to be
having a good time and all,

768
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,836
but that postcard, it really
ripped my heart out, you know?

769
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,539
Places I'll never see.

770
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,447
There are worse things
than your woman going on vacation.

771
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,714
- Yeah? Like what?
- She could leave you.

772
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,983
She could send you
a letter one day and say

773
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,616
she thinks the time has come
to move on with her life.

774
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,757
I'm saying

775
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,820
I thought the worst thing
that could happen to me

776
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:17,231
was losing my legs,
losing my freedom.

777
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,394
But Annabella, that's...

778
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,335
like losing my manhood...

779
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,339
another big chunk
of who I am.

780
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,804
I wish I could
understand you.

781
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,978
Jaz Hoyt's sitting
in the hole

782
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,079
because of the
Reverend Cloutier.

783
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,955
- You work at the mailroom, don't you?
- Yeah.

784
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:18,826
Great. Make sure today that you're
the one pushing around the mail cart.

785
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,626
Make sure you do deliveries
to the hospital ward.

786
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,657
And when you get there,
waste Cloutier.

787
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:28,797
- How?
- A lot of burn victims suffocate.

788
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,312
- Here you go, dago.
- Fuck you, punk.

789
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,405
What's this doing here?

790
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,883
I guess Cloutier's
got mail.

791
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,819
Officer!

792
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,187
Officer! Officer!

793
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,987
Officer!

794
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,721
Bitch!

795
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,958
Get the fuck off him!

796
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,729
Okay, okay.

797
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,671
Okay, look at me.
Look at me.

798
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,277
- Where's Gunner?
- In solitary.

799
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,113
- And Cloutier?
- Alive.

800
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,880
Shit!

801
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,512
Now I got to tell Jaz.

802
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,250
- Come here.
- What? What? What?

803
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,019
I saw him.

804
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,548
- Saw who?
- Cloutier.

805
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:00,290
In the hole, all of a sudden
he appears looking healthy.

806
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,525
- You were dreaming.
- I saw him.

807
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:06,127
- That's crazy.
- I saw him just like Jim Burns saw him.

808
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,034
Jim Burns is dead.
You killed him.

809
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,596
- We killed him.
- Okay, look, relax, all right?

810
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,631
Fuck you, relax.
You fucking...

811
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,521
Put the cigarette out.

812
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,719
Okay, okay.

813
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,922
Smoking's bad for you, Jaz.

814
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,453
Yeah, I know.

815
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,123
Oh shit.

816
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,067
Help!
Lopresti!

817
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,866
- Help!
- They cannot hear you.

818
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,940
I'm in your mind.

819
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:50,538
I'm all the guilt
stacked up inside your soul,

820
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,344
your whole life, ever since
you killed your first cat.

821
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,908
And I'm not going
anywhere unless...

822
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,285
- Unless what?
- You do something for me.

823
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,088
- Anything.
- Kill Timmy Kirk.

824
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,357
- But...
- Kill Timmy Kirk, Jaz.

825
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,856
Or I'll be visiting you every night
for the rest of your life.

826
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,568
Hey!

827
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,663
Put the cigarette out!

828
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:28,975
Dr. Nathan says that the Reverend
Cloutier's recovery is remarkable.

829
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,284
He should be talking
in weeks.

830
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,654
Good news.

831
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,716
Don't hondel me, Kirk.

832
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,093
You were the one who arranged to have
that biker try and kill Cloutier.

833
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,329
How'd you like
a blowjob?

834
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,394
- Kirk!
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

835
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,065
What are you...
Hey!

836
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,734
Hoyt!
Officer!

837
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,277
Wait a minute...
what the...

838
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,308
Oh, Jesus.

839
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,427
Oh, Jesus!

840
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,505
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

841
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,666
Give me a CPC
and a chem-20, stat.

842
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,901
I confess to the murder
of Jim Burns.

843
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,108
I confess to the murder
of Ralph Gulino.

844
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,084
I confess to the murder
of Brian Lawlor.

845
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,610
I confess to the murder
of Adam Decoursey.

846
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:42,022
I confess to the murder
of David Horton.

847
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,550
Gloria, Hoyt's claiming that Cloutier
ordered him to kill Timmy Kirk.

848
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,792
That's insane. Cloutier can barely move
and can't even speak yet.

849
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,823
I don't know.
Hoyt really seems to believe

850
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,858
that Cloutier appeared
to him last night.

851
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:56,395
You think Hoyt's going for the insanity
defense to keep him off death row?

852
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,428
Maybe.

853
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,048
- Gloria.
- Yeah?

854
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,277
Where is he?

855
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,181
- Did you move Cloutier?
- No.

856
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,917
He was here
a minute ago.

857
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,584
Well,
now he's gone.

858
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,438
But upon entering
the tomb,

859
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,737
I saw a young man
sitting at the right side,

860
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,937
clothed in a white robe.

861
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,339
And they were amazed.

862
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,349
He said to them,
"Do not be terrified.

863
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,181
You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth,
who was crucified.

864
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,349
He has risen."

865
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,448
Everybody's got
their own brand

866
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,823
of miserable shit
to deal with in life,

867
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,954
but if you keep your eye
on your dream, you'll pull through.

868
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,659
In Oz, the opposite is true.

869
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,033
The way to get through the shit
is by having no dreams at all.

870
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,301
In fact, one of the biggest consolations
for a man doing time

871
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,774
is knowing 90% of people
in the outside world

872
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,868
don't realize their dreams.

873
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,505
So you see, we're not really
missing out on anything.

874
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,344
Are we?
