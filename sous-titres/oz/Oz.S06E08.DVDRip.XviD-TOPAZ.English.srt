1
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,356
I'm innocent.

2
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,423
I'm innocent.

3
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,024
I am innocent!

4
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,765
Innocent.

5
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,704
I'm innocent, too.

6
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,434
I'm innocent.

7
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:51,136
You go to any prison, you ask
any guy who's serving time

8
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,702
and he'll tell you
he's in-no-cent.

9
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,476
"I got a bum rap.
I had a lousy lawyer.

10
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,984
I was in Toledo
visiting my mama."

11
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,248
Yeah, you'll hear
A whole pack of lies.

12
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,983
But what about that one brother
who's telling the truth,

13
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,821
the one who really is
innocent?

14
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,295
His voice is buried
so damn deep beneath the others,

15
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,763
he's gonna grow hoarse
just trying to be heard.

16
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,802
Leo!

17
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,674
Leo Glynn is dead.

18
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:30,842
I'm sorry, the reality
just hasn't sunk in.

19
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,977
I feel so bad,
you know?

20
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,512
He and I hadn't been
getting along lately.

21
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,718
Well, we all had
our disagreements with Leo.

22
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,128
But, still, he was the best man
for the worst job.

23
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,687
Amen.

24
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:51,862
I spoke to his ex-wife
at the cemetery.

25
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,134
She and his daughter
didn't want to make the drive...

26
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,835
would I pack up
Leo's belongings.

27
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,708
I don't think she has a clue
about my relationship with him.

28
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:03,544
Mary knew.

29
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,609
She said she was happy
Leo had someone.

30
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:10,452
She hated the idea of him being
all alone after the divorce.

31
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,515
Tim, I talked
to the governor

32
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,685
about naming you
the new warden.

33
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,554
I'm sure Devlin jumped.

34
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,567
Well, he didn't say no.

35
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,332
Doesn't matter,
don't want the job.

36
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:29,473
This place needs a strong,
sensible hand, Tim.

37
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,535
That's you.

38
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,240
Stanton has
some interesting hearsay.

39
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,614
Lionel Kelsch
whacked the warden...

40
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,585
and Willy Brandt.

41
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,319
Before that, he helped Brandt
waste Mayor Loewen.

42
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,655
How do you know this?

43
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:50,423
Kelsch is a bragger,
and I hate braggers!

44
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,330
All right, take Stanton
into protective custody.

45
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,924
Bring Kelsch to the hole.

46
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,271
All right!

47
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,576
- You ever been in the hole?
- No, sir.

48
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,044
First, you're naked,
so it's cold.

49
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,879
Then you piss
and shit in a bucket.

50
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,847
Worse, you're alone,

51
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,151
utterly alone,
24 hours a day.

52
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,521
Except for the meals,
right?

53
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,789
When you see the hacks?

54
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,022
Theoretically.

55
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,362
See, some of these guys...

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,664
they forget
to bring the food,

57
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:34,662
especially to someone accused
of killing the man they respected.

58
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,607
- Hmm.
- Strip.

59
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,166
Um...

60
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,304
McManus, wait!

61
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,075
What are
my alternatives?

62
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,447
You can give me the name
of the person that hired you.

63
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,614
Well, the governor's eulogy
of Glynn was very moving.

64
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,021
Oh, yeah?
I nodded off.

65
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,821
What does McManus
want to see me about?

66
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,520
I don't know,
he just told me to find you.

67
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,858
Think he'll get
the warden gig?

68
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,488
Never know.

69
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,538
Don't be shy,
Officer Johnson.

70
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,972
I'm gonna have
to read you your rights.

71
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,109
Before they cart
your ass downtown...

72
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,943
just tell me why.

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,785
Why-why'd you hire Brandt
in the first place, huh?

74
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,153
Was it because
of those little girls?

75
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,286
I'm not saying word one
until I get a lawyer

76
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,889
and cut myself
a nice, juicy deal.

77
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,626
Leo trusted you!

78
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,704
- Let's go.
- Go ahead.

79
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,080
Tim.

80
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,913
You remember back
five years ago

81
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,976
when you announced
from this very stage

82
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,181
that I was eliminating
all high school

83
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,055
and college
equivalency programs?

84
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,787
I'm gonna give a speech
praising education

85
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:05,228
as the one last hope
prisoners have...

86
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,495
and naming the new program
after Leo Glynn.

87
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,903
Hmm, how the times
have changed.

88
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:15,907
Maybe it's me,
maybe I've mellowed.

89
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,239
We've just received a call
from Detective Tarnowski.

90
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,711
Adrian Johnson has
implicated Perry

91
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:24,204
in the murders of Loewen,
Brandt and Leo.

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,911
What?

93
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,345
You're next, Devlin.

94
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,358
- Governor, we need to...
- Shut up, Perry.

95
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,126
Cancel
the press conference.

96
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,831
Let's get back
to the mansion.

97
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,496
These charges
are scurrilous.

98
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,666
It's a vain attempt
to attack a fine young man.

99
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,609
Yeah, who's one step away
from getting fucked up the ass,

100
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,202
unless you can
make a deal, too.

101
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,076
- Hey, I only...
- Shut up!

102
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,742
- I'll handle this.
- How?

103
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,444
See, I don't see
what you can do,

104
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,043
except type out
your resignation.

105
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,987
You know what
the irony is?

106
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,923
The irony is that Wilson Loewen
got you elected!

107
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,051
And now, Loewen's ghost
is gonna bring you down.

108
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,120
My only hope is that
when you go to prison,

109
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:13,461
they send you here
to "Oz."

110
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,161
Ellie, you coming?

111
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,729
No, I'm not,
you little prick.

112
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,668
I accept
your resignation.

113
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,343
- Yours, too, McManus.
- I'm not going anywhere.

114
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:30,078
We'll see about that!

115
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,810
Perry!

116
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,817
Thank you all
for coming.

117
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,554
Leo Glynn's untimely death

118
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,792
- has left a void in Oswald's...
- Can the speech, Commissioner.

119
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,493
Just tell us who's
gonna be our new boss.

120
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,229
All righty.

121
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,999
Some of you may already know
him from when he worked here,

122
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,439
More recently, he's been
doing a bang-up job

123
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,410
at Lardner... Martin Querns.

124
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,208
Hello, everybody.

125
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:04,111
I'm back.

126
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,887
Tim McManus...

127
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,584
come on down.

128
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:23,394
I don't know what you did
to piss off the governor,

129
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,992
but he sure as shit
wants your head

130
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:27,368
hanging off a spike
on the north tower.

131
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,430
- So, I'm out.
- Consider this your month's notice.

132
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,340
- So, I'm out.
- Consider this your month's notice.

133
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,070
Fabulous.

134
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,408
Of course, a lot
can happen in a month.

135
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:37,676
This murder scandal
could mean the end

136
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,807
of Devlin's days in office.

137
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,646
I don't know.

138
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:45,382
He's skated through worse
and come out on top.

139
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,016
Like I said,
we have to wait and see.

140
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:51,425
Of course, if he goes,

141
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,487
you may not have to.

142
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,124
I wasn't lying when I said

143
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,158
I was a big fan
of the concept of "Em City."

144
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,579
Did he fire you?

145
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,447
I'm not sure.

146
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,154
Sister.

147
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,287
Get your buns in here.

148
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,493
This is
a restraint chair.

149
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:34,902
It will be placed
in the hole.

150
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:39,739
If you disobey,
you will be placed in it.

151
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:42,745
I wanted you all
to see this monster,

152
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,684
to let you know I will not
take any shit from anyone.

153
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,081
So...

154
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:54,080
remember...

155
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:59,557
don't fuck
with Querns.

156
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,531
Here's a story,
and it's true.

157
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:11,371
Mariano Absun escaped
The Connor Correctional Center

158
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,705
in Hominy, Oklahoma

159
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:14,973
by hiding in the back
of a garbage truck.

160
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,003
His body was found
two hours later,

161
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,515
crushed to death
in the truck's trash tray.

162
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,986
Now, Absun was only serving
a three-year sentence.

163
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,147
Three years.

164
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:28,453
That's how desperate he was
to get the fuck out.

165
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:45,332
Bob, can't sleep?

166
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,400
No.

167
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:49,139
This is the best time...

168
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,943
when it's quiet,

169
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,849
when the day still
has possibilities.

170
00:10:56,486 --> 00:11:00,081
Today is Stella's first day back
after her breast surgery.

171
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:03,684
- You're excited.
- And afraid.

172
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,888
Before she went
into the hospital,

173
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,329
I told Stella
that I loved her.

174
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,959
Bob, you old seadog.

175
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,401
But she said I didn't...

176
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,604
which of course means
she doesn't love me.

177
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,744
Stella?

178
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:34,255
I got your flowers.

179
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:38,517
- Oh.
- Did I hurt you?

180
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,860
No.

181
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm just not used
to the new breast yet.

182
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:48,065
I can't tell the difference.

183
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:51,836
Only God can make a tree,
but fortunately,

184
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:56,005
man can fix pretty much
everything else.

185
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,981
Any problems?

186
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,144
The medicine I'm on
is pixilating my memory,

187
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:04,380
so, if I start
to repeat myself

188
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:07,754
or forget a name,
forgive me.

189
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,454
No, it's you who
has to forgive me

190
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:14,362
for my silliness
for thinking

191
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,696
we both shared
the same feelings.

192
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,997
The same feelings?

193
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,594
I don't know,

194
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:23,902
But I do love you,
Robert...

195
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,965
in my fashion.

196
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:29,776
It's all a matter
of perspective.

197
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:35,218
"To see a world
in a grain of sand

198
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,119
and a heaven
in a wild flower..."

199
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,680
"Hold infinity in
the palm of your hand..."

200
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,750
"and eternity in an hour."

201
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,960
Ms. Coffo!

202
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,731
"Adseg" is
a restricted area.

203
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,968
I want to see
Pablo Rosa.

204
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,373
Oh, he's not allowed
any visitors.

205
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:01,570
But I work here.

206
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:04,136
Those are the rules.

207
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:08,811
How do we get the rules
changed just this once?

208
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,615
I don't know.

209
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:13,122
- Talk to someone higher up.
- Who?

210
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:14,714
I don't know.

211
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:18,194
He pretends to be a tough guy,
but he's not.

212
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:21,163
Pablo's just another
terrified kid.

213
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:26,226
And I'm afraid what's going
through his head right now,

214
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,897
sitting alone
in that hell hole.

215
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,702
What would you
like to happen?

216
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,732
At the very least,
get him some books to read.

217
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:37,203
They'll never allow him
to have books in the hole.

218
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,875
But there's always a way
to finagle something.

219
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,986
How much cash
do you have?

220
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,722
Pablo, can you hear me?

221
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,162
Ms. C?

222
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:56,062
You're okay?

223
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,294
I'm fine.

224
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,303
And you?

225
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,396
I'm going sort of crazy.

226
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,168
Well...

227
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,176
I'm here to help you
with that.

228
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,871
How?

229
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:11,710
I'm gonna read to you...

230
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:17,311
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."
Chapter One.

231
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:20,846
"Tom plays,
fights and hides.

232
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,019
'Tom! '
No answer.

233
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,393
'Tom! '
No answer.

234
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,194
'What's goin' on
with that boy, I wonder.

235
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,791
You, Tom! '

236
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,167
The old lady
pulled her spectacles down

237
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:36,331
and looked out over them
about the room.

238
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,774
And she put them up,
and looked out under them.

239
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,938
She seldom or never
looked through them

240
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:45,106
for so small
a thing as a boy."

241
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:51,683
I just had another visit
with Norma and the baby.

242
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:54,155
Fatherhood is
a remarkable thing.

243
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,749
I wouldn't know.

244
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,987
What do you mean?
You had Alex.

245
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,053
But I didn't raise him.

246
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:04,226
He never even knew I was alive
until he was a grown man.

247
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:06,827
I was never
a father to my son.

248
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:10,306
Oh, and here's Ruby,
who's not my own,

249
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,467
who I will help to raise.

250
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,740
Still, I'd like some day
to have my own offspring,

251
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,748
From my own loins,
as it were.

252
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,977
Agamemnon, please.

253
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:24,681
I've just eaten.

254
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:28,282
I guess it's a fool's goal,
since we're not allowed conjugals.

255
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,122
And by the time I'm out,

256
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,060
Norma will be past
her child-bearing years.

257
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,029
There are alternatives.

258
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:36,897
Artificial insemination,
for example.

259
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,060
Sure,
I could jerk off,

260
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:42,162
and then overnight my sperm
to Norma, next-day delivery.

261
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:44,503
Bob, you-you're brilliant!

262
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,814
The commissioner
says no.

263
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,908
No?
How can he say no?

264
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,886
Well, he doesn't want to start
an avalanche of requests

265
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,786
for prisoners to
artificially inseminate.

266
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:02,451
He says that it opens up
the State to safety,

267
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,653
security and legal risks.

268
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,924
But I have a right
to procreate.

269
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:08,396
Well, not necessarily.

270
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:11,332
The United States Supreme Court
guarantees a prisoner

271
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,996
the right to marry
and not to be sterilized.

272
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:16,562
Now, the justices have never
expressed an opinion

273
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,335
on prisoners
bearing children.

274
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,902
- What can we do?
- We? Nothing.

275
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:24,743
You should contact the Society
for Prisoners' Rights,

276
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,646
have them
assign you a lawyer.

277
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,275
I will, goddamn it.

278
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,946
Just because I broke the law
doesn't mean I'm not a man.

279
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,148
True, but, Busmalis,

280
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:36,022
not every man was
supposed to be a father.

281
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,857
Every man should
have a right to choose.

282
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,301
Whoa.

283
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,739
Go easy with that stuff,
Agamemnon.

284
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,709
You're looking
like an oil slick.

285
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,608
You're right...
I'm nervous.

286
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,670
The judicial panel
is meeting today

287
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:00,046
to decide if I can artificially
inseminate Norma.

288
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,607
If they say yes,

289
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,085
I could be a father
by Christmas.

290
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,987
Have you talked this
through with Dr. Nathan?

291
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:10,618
The entire procedure is
costly, time consuming

292
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,753
and most often
unsuccessful.

293
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:16,197
Why are you always trying
to dampen my spirits?

294
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:18,826
Because you constantly rush
into things without thinking,

295
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,233
only to get your heart broken.

296
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,238
That's not true.

297
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,737
Okay, maybe
it's a little true.

298
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:30,302
But, Bob, in Oz,

299
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:31,746
that's all we have,

300
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:34,682
hopes and dreams.

301
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:44,325
Having reviewed
the testimony and evidence,

302
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,488
we have reached
the following conclusion...

303
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:50,397
Since the state has the right
to eliminate conjugal visits,

304
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,993
we do not see restricting
artificial insemination

305
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,095
as unreasonable.

306
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:57,504
And though we agree
that to procreate

307
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,098
is a fundamental right,

308
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,769
the very purpose
of punishment

309
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,402
is to take away
fundamental rights.

310
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:05,642
We, therefore, deny
the plaintiff's petition.

311
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,720
We lost?

312
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,882
I'm afraid so.

313
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:16,414
Well, we-we'll appeal.

314
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:19,428
No, I'm sorry,
there's no appeal.

315
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:21,293
Back to your cage,
Busmalis.

316
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,696
No.

317
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,427
Don't give me any lip.

318
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,834
Wait, you bastard, wait!

319
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:31,073
This is my life we're
talking about, my life!

320
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,575
- Back off!
- You cocksucker!

321
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,170
- Get this man off me!
- I'll kill you, motherfucker!

322
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,712
But it isn't fair!

323
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:42,443
It isn't fair!

324
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,045
It isn't fair!

325
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,596
Morning.

326
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:04,760
What's wrong with her?

327
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,864
Claire asked me
for a second opinion.

328
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,102
Is she sick?

329
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,171
She's pregnant.

330
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,982
You asked to see me,
Father?

331
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,818
Yes, come in,
sit down.

332
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:24,915
What's this about?

333
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,484
Your being pregnant.

334
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:30,053
I'm not trying to insinuate
myself into anything.

335
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:33,066
I just wanted you to know
that if you want to talk.

336
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:39,938
What I tell you
remains between us, right?

337
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:42,238
'Cause I could lose my job.

338
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:46,039
I promise.

339
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:57,686
My relationship with men
in general has been disastrous,

340
00:19:57,725 --> 00:20:00,785
yet here I am
surrounded by them.

341
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,131
Which is why...

342
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:08,965
Father, since coming to Oz,
I have fucked a lot of men.

343
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:11,663
Yeah!

344
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,402
A lot of prisoners.

345
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,680
- You're shocked.
- In a way, yes.

346
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:24,172
And, um, in a way, no.

347
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:28,120
Now, I'm pregnant
by one of them.

348
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:30,385
You know which one?

349
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:33,359
Well, my best guess is
the baby will be golden brown

350
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:35,919
and marinated in salsa...

351
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:39,228
which means
I can't raise him or her

352
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,131
in my redneck neighborhood.

353
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:43,193
I can't afford to move.

354
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:45,432
And if I could,
where would I go?

355
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:47,201
Little Havana?

356
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:49,266
I am screwed.

357
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,801
Claire, are you thinking
of having an abortion, because...

358
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:53,745
Oh, save your breath,
Father.

359
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:56,807
You Catholics aren't the only ones
who are against abortion.

360
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,819
So, what are you gonna do?

361
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:02,117
Take a leave of absence...

362
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:06,251
drop the calf.

363
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:10,195
And from then on,
keep my fuckin' legs crossed.

364
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,537
I'll never be
a father now.

365
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:28,409
Yeah, well, we all got
our problems.

366
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,818
Here's a story,
and it's true.

367
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,292
Up in Vermont,

368
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:42,989
an inmate was caught
breaking into prison.

369
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,191
He'd evidently slipped out
of his work camp,

370
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:46,995
went to a nearby
convenience store,

371
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:49,594
bought a case of beer
and a carton of cigs,

372
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:52,264
and then crawled back
under the fence

373
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:55,901
where he was arrested
by the C.O.'s.

374
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,207
The man was sentenced
to six more months.

375
00:21:58,245 --> 00:21:59,735
And the poor motherfucker,

376
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,611
he didn't even get
to keep the beer.

377
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:04,048
You know what I'm saying?

378
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,711
Okay, raise your arms.

379
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:10,750
Turn around.
Through here.

380
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,487
Jackson Vayhue,
welcome to Oz.

381
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:17,622
It's not my first visit,
Warden.

382
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:19,097
I know.

383
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,998
Since being paroled,

384
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:23,730
I've tried my best to keep other
guys from making my mistake...

385
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:26,205
you know, lecturing the kids
and gangs and stuff.

386
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,071
I'm happy you're here
to do the same.

387
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,236
Younger prisoners look up
to a big basketballer like you.

388
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,577
Well, I hope they hear
what I have to say.

389
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:36,276
After you.

390
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,250
So, in conclusion,

391
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:40,446
I just ask you to use
your time wisely and well.

392
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,284
With any kind of luck,

393
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:46,418
you can pull your
life back together...

394
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,428
And get the fuck out
of Oz.

395
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,399
Can I get an autograph?

396
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:58,633
Officer Brass, you still
dancing down these halls?

397
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,232
Yup. Some of us ain't
as lucky as you.

398
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:03,743
I had nothing to do
with that tendon being sliced.

399
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,301
Oh, I know.

400
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:07,540
Hey, I bought season tickets
to the Knights,

401
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:10,015
so I'll be at the arena
every time you play.

402
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,484
Maybe after a game I can
come into the locker room,

403
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,180
hang out,
meet the other players.

404
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:16,280
No, I don't think so.

405
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:19,087
Oh, okay.

406
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:20,991
Let me ask you something,
Jackson.

407
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,655
When you're out
on the court playing,

408
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:26,257
all those eyes on you,
you ever wonder?

409
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,927
Wonder what?

410
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:29,868
Who's out there?

411
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:32,371
There's a lot of crazies
in the world, man.

412
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,905
No, I'm not afraid.

413
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:39,310
Bro, you got
huge "stundeens."

414
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:41,280
Nice to see you again.

415
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:45,341
All right, fellas.

416
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:47,012
Take care, man.

417
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,094
Dave!

418
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:05,199
Sean, Sean,
you threw me off my game.

419
00:24:06,373 --> 00:24:08,898
Sometimes I wonder
if I wanted to play pro ball

420
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:10,637
because I loved the game
so much,

421
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:14,078
or because I wanted everyone
to see how great I could shoot.

422
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,841
Be adored by millions.

423
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:22,322
Money, women...
the whole rigmarole, huh?

424
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,916
I don't care about
the fringe benefits.

425
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,721
I want to be famous.

426
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,390
I don't want to die being a gimpy
old guard at a half-ass prison.

427
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:34,025
I don't want to disappear.

428
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,830
Well, I mean,
what can you do?

429
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:37,769
You play the hand
life deals you.

430
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:42,605
Sean, I know you did what you
think is right, about Morales.

431
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:45,441
I want to tell you,
I admire you.

432
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,037
I always have.

433
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,105
No hard feelings, huh?

434
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:54,353
Why do I feel like
you're saying goodbye?

435
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,753
I am.

436
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,620
I've decided...

437
00:24:57,658 --> 00:25:00,593
I'm quittin'.

438
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:02,060
To do what?

439
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,929
Reshuffle the deck,
play a new hand.

440
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:19,107
This just in...
basketball star Jackson Vayhue

441
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:22,775
was shot at this afternoon
during practice at the arena.

442
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:24,408
The assaillant David Brass

443
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,248
had been working
as a guard at the Oswald...

444
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,220
Officer Murphy?

445
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:31,224
Vayhue served time at Oswald
and says he barely knew Brass,

446
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:34,989
though they did play opposite
each other in a prison basketball game.

447
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,155
Come on over
to the other side.

448
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,334
Here's a story,
and it's true.

449
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:45,338
A municipal court judge
in Texas

450
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:48,398
was indicted on four counts
of sexual misconduct.

451
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:50,933
Seemed this judge
extorted sexual favors

452
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:53,344
from the female relatives
of criminal defendants

453
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,315
in exchange for reducing
the defendants' bond,

454
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,443
or ordering their release.

455
00:25:58,485 --> 00:26:01,181
Hey, when you're horny,
you're horny.

456
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:04,681
Mr. Hoyt, thank you
For coming to see us.

457
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:07,057
- I'm Father Mukada.
- How do you do?

458
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:09,062
Oh, and this is
Sister Peter Marie.

459
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:11,360
Sorry. Hello,
nice To meet you.

460
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:12,524
How do you do?

461
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:16,063
This, um...

462
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:21,234
this is my first trip
to a prison.

463
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,902
Oh, you haven't
visited Jaz before?

464
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:25,844
No.

465
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:30,009
I'm not exactly sure what it is
that you want from me.

466
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,146
Well, we feel that in order
for Jaz to fully recover,

467
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:38,123
he needs to deal with
certain emotional problems.

468
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:40,285
Yeah.

469
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:44,525
You can't blame
Evangeline and me

470
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:47,055
for the way
the boy turned out.

471
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,091
We were good parents.

472
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,969
I mean, we didn't
just give him things.

473
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:53,996
We-we gave him love,

474
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,032
plenty of love.

475
00:26:56,076 --> 00:26:56,565
But there was always something
not quite right about the boy

476
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:59,910
But there was always something
not quite right about the boy

477
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,472
from the very first day

478
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:06,543
that we brought him home
from the orphanage.

479
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,817
Jaz was adopted?

480
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:12,484
Oh, yes. My wife and I
couldn't have children.

481
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,687
We adopted three.

482
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:16,719
Have you ever tried
to find out more

483
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:17,991
about Jaz's birth-parents?

484
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:22,627
Yes, the father died
in prison.

485
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:27,004
The mother lived
in Morrisville.

486
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,000
Whether she still
lives there, who knows.

487
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:34,013
Mr. Hoyt, could I have
the information

488
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,675
- about Jaz's birth-parents?
- Certainly.

489
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:37,342
Drink your juice.

490
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,544
Drink your juice.

491
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:40,814
- No.
- Drink your juice.

492
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:43,822
- No!
- Drink the goddamn juice.

493
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:45,221
No, bitch!

494
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:49,991
Get the fuck
out of my face!

495
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:55,961
Jessica, one of the hardest
things about working in Oz

496
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:58,731
is trying to separate
the man from his crime.

497
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:01,365
If you can't do that,
even with Jaz Hoyt,

498
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,170
you shouldn't be here.

499
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:05,473
No, I'm sorry.

500
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:08,571
You're right as usual.

501
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,844
Let me... let me
make it up to you.

502
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:13,249
Are you... are you free
for lunch?

503
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:14,980
No, actually.

504
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,887
I'm in the middle of trying to locate
Hoyt's birth mother.

505
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:19,948
Why?

506
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,324
I want to know
where Hoyt came from.

507
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:24,261
In order to save him?

508
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:26,856
Well, yes.

509
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,992
You are
a remarkable man, Ray.

510
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:32,594
You are a saint.

511
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:34,970
Hardly.

512
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:39,501
If you won't have lunch with me,
how about dinner?

513
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:42,810
You haven't eaten unless
you've tasted my roast chicken.

514
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,577
I won't take no
for an answer.

515
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:48,212
All right,
I'd be delighted.

516
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:49,551
Great.

517
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:51,283
7:30?

518
00:29:04,637 --> 00:29:09,165
He was only one day-old
when I gave him up for adoption.

519
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,700
My boyfriend had just
been sent to prison,

520
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:16,203
and my parents thought
that I should have a chance at life.

521
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:20,081
Buster was a real bastard.

522
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:23,350
You should excuse me,
Father,

523
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:25,721
but he was a slimeball.

524
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:28,420
My husband, John...

525
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,396
he's a sweet, sweet man.

526
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,202
I gotta tell you, I'm real nervous
about seeing my son.

527
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,899
I actually thought
to call and cancel.

528
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,307
I'll be with you
every step.

529
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:47,073
Thank you.

530
00:29:47,112 --> 00:29:49,979
Mrs. Oppenheimer,
Jaz is in an extremely

531
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:52,609
volatile mental state.

532
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:55,552
He may say terrible,
terrible things.

533
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,884
I have no expectations,
Father.

534
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:04,819
I only hope that...

535
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:10,732
I hope that my visit
can help make my son whole.

536
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:15,104
Are you ready, Jaz?

537
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,631
Uh-huh.

538
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:28,820
- Hi.
- Mama.

539
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,685
Hello.

540
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:47,667
Well, we'll see you
at 12:00 noon tomorrow then.

541
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,298
Excellent.

542
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,673
Thanks again for everything.

543
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:56,642
Okay, goodbye.

544
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:00,141
Working late?

545
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:02,517
Well, yes.

546
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:06,817
I've been trying to do
what you suggested...

547
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:09,953
to separate the man
from the crime.

548
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,964
But I don't know, I see Hoyt
every day in the hospital ward,

549
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,456
and the two seem
to be intertwined.

550
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,333
There are many, many places

551
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,133
looking for qualified nurses,
Jessica.

552
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:23,437
- I could help you...
- Then we'd never see each other.

553
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:28,778
Look, I'm certainly not your
only reason for working in Oz.

554
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,577
Not my only reason,
no...

555
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:35,379
but I have
so few close friends.

556
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:39,284
Here, let me.

557
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,533
Please, stop that.

558
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,731
Stop what?

559
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:56,764
Stop touching me.

560
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,437
Oh, I'm sorry.

561
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:03,915
No, I'm sorry that I can't
be more to you.

562
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:05,507
What do you mean?

563
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,952
I took a vow
of celibacy.

564
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,820
Cel...

565
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,688
Do you...

566
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:17,155
How dare you!

567
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:19,187
I am a good
Catholic woman.

568
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:21,563
I have been
all my life!

569
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,229
- That's not what...
- How dare you have such thoughts!

570
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,465
My son was right
about you,

571
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:32,102
you are nothing but
a fuckin' slanty-eyed mongrel!

572
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:38,945
You do something for me.

573
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:41,452
Kill Timmy Kirk.

574
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,359
Ray, Ray.

575
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:50,021
- Hey.
- Listen to this.

576
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:53,463
After his mother left,
Jaz Hoyt really opened up.

577
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:56,024
He told me it was
the Reverend Cloutier

578
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:59,560
who ordered him to kill
Timmy Kirk the first time.

579
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,505
Well, how is
that possible?

580
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,030
Cloutier was
in the burn unit.

581
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:05,305
He was barely able to make
sounds, let alone speak.

582
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:08,438
Well, he says that Cloutier
appeared to him in his cell

583
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,948
looking completely normal.

584
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,080
An apparition?

585
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,349
Afterward, when he was
sent to solitary,

586
00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:18,652
his biker buddies decided
to take revenge.

587
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:21,353
They went to the burn unit
and carried Cloutier away.

588
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:23,418
To where?

589
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,692
Well, Hoyt says
that's the one fact

590
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:27,631
he will reveal
only to you.

591
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:32,897
Where did they take
the Reverend Cloutier?

592
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:35,065
If I tell you,

593
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:37,769
the other bikers,
they'll kill us both.

594
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,371
Hoyt, I need to know.

595
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,350
Okay.

596
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,450
Here's a story
and it's true.

597
00:34:57,489 --> 00:35:01,220
A male prisoner at the Muskegon
Correctional Facility in Michigan

598
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,353
sexually assaulted
the three-year-old daughter

599
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,158
of a woman
who was visiting him.

600
00:35:05,197 --> 00:35:08,030
As a result, the state D.O.C.
Came up with the harshest,

601
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,432
most restrictive
visiting policies

602
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:12,061
of anywhere in the country,

603
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:14,163
which included the banning
of all minors,

604
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:15,867
even family members.

605
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,502
So you see,
one man's fuck up

606
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:20,842
fucked up
everybody else's happiness.

607
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:25,606
Redding, I have
to talk to you.

608
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,413
I feel guilty lying
to my brothers,

609
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:31,888
telling them
the book binding machinery

610
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:33,915
was destroyed by accident.

611
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,427
Did you get your check
from the insurance company?

612
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:42,022
So none of you all
lost any money,

613
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:45,867
which you sure as shit would
have when the company folded.

614
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:48,065
The money
is not the issue.

615
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:52,440
You committed a criminal act,
and I'm benefitting from it.

616
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,379
I have to do something.

617
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,712
Whatever you do
will destroy your reputation

618
00:35:57,749 --> 00:36:01,116
with your brothers
over there.

619
00:36:01,153 --> 00:36:03,417
Can you live with that?

620
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:33,184
You gonna tell me
what that was all about?

621
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:35,311
I was coming
to see you next,

622
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:37,254
to make
a full confession.

623
00:36:38,924 --> 00:36:41,893
I'm all ears,
as they say.

624
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:45,328
The accident which destroyed
the book-binding machinery

625
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:47,355
was not an accident.

626
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:49,924
Burr Redding
is responsible.

627
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:53,037
Why jabber now?

628
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:55,130
Because I feel guilty.

629
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:59,007
I disgraced the memory
of Kareem Said.

630
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,308
Each night when I pray,

631
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:04,804
the words become more
and more hollow.

632
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,250
My soul is in peril.

633
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:11,881
I have to punish you.

634
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:14,518
Officer.

635
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,996
Take him back
to "Em City,"

636
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,589
put him in the cage.

637
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:25,268
I don't know what you're
talking about, McManus.

638
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:28,205
I haven't been anywhere near
that book-binding machinery.

639
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,299
Arif says
you sent someone.

640
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:32,276
Arif is delusional!

641
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:33,778
What's going on?

642
00:37:33,812 --> 00:37:36,645
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to find a new foreman, Donna.

643
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:39,549
Redding's taking
an early retirement in solitary.

644
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:42,712
- You got no proof.
- Arif's word is good enough for me.

645
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:43,652
Get him out of here.

646
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:44,213
Get him out of here.

647
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,814
Uh, Tim...

648
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,587
I just signed
a new contract

649
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,355
with a major magazine
publishing house.

650
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:51,124
- I need Burr.
- I'm sorry.

651
00:37:51,163 --> 00:37:54,030
- Is there a deal we can work out?
- No, no deals!

652
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:57,194
This is not a negotiation,
this is Oz!

653
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,987
Here's a story
and it's true.

654
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:26,794
The Wisconsin D.O.C. Has banned
all sexually explicit materials

655
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:28,766
received by prisoners
through the mail.

656
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:31,861
These include the swimsuit issue
of "Sports Illustrated,"

657
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:34,805
copies of "Vanity Fair,"
"Maxim" and "Rolling Stone,"

658
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,832
as well as various motorcycle
and fitness magazines.

659
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:40,071
Also banned was
a photograph

660
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,239
of Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel.

661
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,647
The D.O.C. Felt
the nude paintings

662
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:46,207
that adorn
the Vatican's ceiling

663
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:49,516
could, quote,
"impede rehabilitation."

664
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,664
Chucky.

665
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:04,566
- Hey, hey.
- You make the call?

666
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:04,898
- Hey, hey.
- You make the call?

667
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:07,666
- Yeah, I made the call.
- And our mutual friend?

668
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:09,570
He gave the okay.

669
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:14,210
You know, Angelo and I have done
a lot of business together.

670
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:16,805
In fact, at every club
I've opened,

671
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:20,544
your nephew has been
like a silent partner.

672
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,313
I don't intend
to be so silent.

673
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:27,756
You need to mellow out,
big man.

674
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,953
You ever done "D"?

675
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:34,230
On me.

676
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:36,256
Pass it out
to your boys.

677
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:46,401
You see, Chulo,

678
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:48,241
it's as easy as
one, two, three,

679
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,270
"dial me a dago."

680
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:57,453
That's all right.

681
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,957
Where'd you get that?

682
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:09,489
From Torquemada.

683
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,198
Yo, you ever been
to one of his clubs?

684
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,070
Nope.

685
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,305
Never got past
the velvet ropes.

686
00:40:20,344 --> 00:40:22,073
Huh-uh.

687
00:40:22,113 --> 00:40:24,809
You better slow up
on those things, man.

688
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:27,909
I got into Dino's once.

689
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:30,045
The lights...

690
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,987
the sounds...

691
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:33,923
And the women.

692
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:45,329
Yo, chico,
settle down, man.

693
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,098
The guard's going
to put your ass

694
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:48,833
in the restraining chair.

695
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:51,239
Torquemada says he's going
to start giving destiny

696
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:54,005
to the fuckin' hacks,
too, man!

697
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,177
Whoo!

698
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:07,848
What's going on?

699
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:10,383
What's going on, man?

700
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:12,123
Where am I?

701
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:14,393
Oh, shit!

702
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:16,332
It's okay.

703
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,460
Don't touch me!
Don't, don't!

704
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:20,993
Don't finger me.
Don't, aah!

705
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,038
Get it off!
Get it off of me!

706
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:39,147
Yo!

707
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:45,222
All right, put him
on a pulse, stat.

708
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,702
Shake down!

709
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:23,157
You seem down.

710
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:27,056
Yeah.

711
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:31,060
A guy...

712
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,330
overdosed.

713
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,707
Close friend?

714
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:40,077
You know, in Oz,

715
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:43,811
you don't have friends.

716
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:48,584
You have people that
look the same as you.

717
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,151
Wolfgang had the Aryans...

718
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,287
and me...

719
00:42:57,331 --> 00:43:00,767
well, I've mostly
been a loner.

720
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:03,869
Me, too.

721
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:10,341
Funny, I used to dread
coming here to visit Wolfgang,

722
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,845
but I don't anymore.

723
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:30,088
Merry Christmas,
motherfucker!

724
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,798
You've had your last meeting
with Cathy Jo Cutler.

725
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,272
The girl is being
talked to right now.

726
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:41,968
If you hurt her...

727
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:45,035
What? You'll get your drugged-out
Latino pals to come at me?

728
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:48,571
No, no, no.
Just you and me, carajo.

729
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:51,584
And ruin your chances
for parole,

730
00:43:51,618 --> 00:43:53,950
all because of a cheap,
stupid cunt

731
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,820
who doesn't
know her place?

732
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:06,791
I had a little run-in
with the Aryans.

733
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:09,632
- We worked it out.
- Yeah, I can see that.

734
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,332
Listen, I know you're gonna
want to help, McManus,

735
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,206
but it'd be better for me
and for my parole

736
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:18,006
if this little incident
just disappeared.

737
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:19,876
Miguel...

738
00:44:19,913 --> 00:44:22,404
Look, the reason
why we fought

739
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:24,542
ain't gonna
come back again.

740
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:26,519
Schillinger's
gonna see to that.

741
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:30,387
Whatever you do, it's gonna
make matters worse.

742
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:32,153
Okay.

743
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:34,820
But the good news is Luis Ruiz
has agreed to see you.

744
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:36,523
How did you do that?

745
00:44:36,563 --> 00:44:40,556
Like everything else
in life, took persistence.

746
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:52,572
Ouch.

747
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:54,581
That looks painful, baby.

748
00:44:54,615 --> 00:44:56,515
It's okay.

749
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,781
I've got a new shipment
of D-tabs coming in today.

750
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,551
- So?
- So, since Guerra went whacky,

751
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,387
hacks are making it
tougher

752
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:07,894
for me to move the merchandise
through the system.

753
00:45:07,928 --> 00:45:09,327
I need your help.

754
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:10,853
Why me?

755
00:45:10,898 --> 00:45:12,889
McManus trusts you.

756
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:14,525
Listen to me.

757
00:45:14,568 --> 00:45:16,832
I don't know how many times
I'm going to have to tell you

758
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,862
until it actually penetrates that little
piata you've got for a brain.

759
00:45:19,907 --> 00:45:21,772
I don't want any part
of your bullshit.

760
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:23,071
You're so fuckin' sexy.

761
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,873
Get your hands off
of me.

762
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:26,140
I like
straight boys best.

763
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,171
You know what?

764
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:31,707
Here's one straight boy
you ain't gonna be bending over.

765
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:34,653
Leave me alone!

766
00:45:36,957 --> 00:45:39,653
Ugh, that's disgusting.

767
00:45:43,997 --> 00:45:45,828
Now remember, if you
want to get paroled,

768
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:48,664
you've got to convince Ruiz
that you're sincere.

769
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,636
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

770
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:58,173
Hello, Mr. Ruiz.

771
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:01,972
I don't have a lot
of time, Alvarez.

772
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:03,777
Say what you've
got to say.

773
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:08,013
Uh, Luis, we agreed that you two
would have a conversation,

774
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:10,021
that you would
spend a few minutes

775
00:46:10,055 --> 00:46:12,580
- getting to know each other.
- Alone.

776
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:14,182
Yeah.

777
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,217
Okay, I'll be
right outside.

778
00:46:26,538 --> 00:46:28,631
Mr. Ruiz...

779
00:46:28,674 --> 00:46:32,906
I'm sorry I hit you
at the last parole hearing.

780
00:46:32,945 --> 00:46:34,879
Why are you sorry?

781
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:36,938
I was an asshole...

782
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,850
deliberately
provoking you

783
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:42,183
to see if you could
handle yourself.

784
00:46:43,822 --> 00:46:46,017
You failed.

785
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:47,685
I know.

786
00:46:47,726 --> 00:46:50,058
- But...
- But what, Alvarez?

787
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:55,559
Sorry don't cut it.

788
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:58,161
"I've turned myself around,
I said three hail Marys."

789
00:46:58,203 --> 00:46:59,830
Bullshit!

790
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:01,998
It's not bullshit.

791
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,905
I am improving.

792
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:05,500
I know you, Alvarez.

793
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:07,535
I grew up on
the same streets.

794
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:09,308
I've seen hot-headed dicks
like you

795
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:11,714
give every Latino
a bad name.

796
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,980
Well, the final score
is this...

797
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:17,112
You aren't
getting out of Oz,

798
00:47:17,155 --> 00:47:19,919
not in three years,

799
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:22,586
not in 30...

800
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,687
not ever.

801
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,561
Oh, we'll still go
through the procedure,

802
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:28,361
so each time
your number comes up,

803
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,096
I can see how much
you've ripened.

804
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:33,468
I'm going to watch
you ripen until you rot.

805
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:35,735
That's right...

806
00:47:35,774 --> 00:47:37,469
hit me again.

807
00:47:38,644 --> 00:47:40,669
Go on.

808
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,728
Miguel?

809
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:58,423
Miguel?

810
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:16,078
Guess who's
your new roommate?

811
00:48:19,618 --> 00:48:21,779
I knew you'd
be thrilled.

812
00:48:24,456 --> 00:48:27,721
You want to help me
make my bed, sugar?

813
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:31,956
Hey.

814
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:35,395
Let me
tell you something.

815
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:38,130
You may have
wined and dined,

816
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,197
hired and fired,
bought and sold...

817
00:48:43,742 --> 00:48:46,336
and I may have never done
nothing with my life...

818
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:51,080
but there is no way.

819
00:48:51,116 --> 00:48:53,209
Hear me?

820
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:56,550
No way that I'm ever
going to be your bitch.

821
00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:01,884
Miguel...

822
00:49:03,395 --> 00:49:05,590
dumpling...

823
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,030
I don't want you
to be my bitch.

824
00:49:10,235 --> 00:49:12,499
I have
a little confession.

825
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:16,974
I'm a virgin.

826
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:20,971
That's right.

827
00:49:21,012 --> 00:49:24,948
I've never had sex
with men, women,

828
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:27,349
fish or foul.

829
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,649
Now, you're thinking,
"I've heard about the orgies."

830
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:35,683
At my clubs, yes,

831
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:38,719
my home, quite a scene...

832
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:42,131
but I myself never indulge.

833
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:46,468
I provide
a pleasurable environment...

834
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:49,030
the necessary ambrosia.

835
00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:52,904
Then I let nature
take its course.

836
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,407
And I watch.

837
00:49:56,448 --> 00:49:58,211
Lights out!

838
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:08,192
So, I don't want
to fuck you.

839
00:50:08,226 --> 00:50:11,093
That would be
too common.

840
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:15,225
No, Miguel Alvarez...

841
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:16,894
I want to be you.

842
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:22,773
You want
To be me, huh?

843
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:26,243
You know what?

844
00:50:27,245 --> 00:50:29,270
You're welcome to it.

845
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:36,886
I'm so tired.

846
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,788
I'm tired of trying.

847
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:46,757
I'm tired of the walls.

848
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:52,669
The lies.

849
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:56,102
The fear.

850
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:02,503
The death.

851
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:07,915
I'm so tired.

852
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:16,153
You got one
of those D-tabs?

853
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:41,383
Well...

854
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:45,953
you want
to party, baby?

855
00:51:45,957 --> 00:51:46,981
You want
to party, baby?

856
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:49,356
Keep them
D-tabs running.

857
00:52:02,073 --> 00:52:04,439
Here's a story
and it's true.

858
00:52:04,475 --> 00:52:07,342
The Oregon Legislature
passed a law

859
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:10,006
authorizing the State D.O.C.
To charge inmates

860
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:12,607
for costs associated
with their imprisonment.

861
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,814
We're talking such luxury items
as medical care,

862
00:52:16,854 --> 00:52:19,823
administrative expenditures,
room and board,

863
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:23,588
which they estimate
costs $65.00 a day,

864
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:27,222
Or $25,000
a year per prisoner.

865
00:52:27,264 --> 00:52:30,256
Given that Oregon pays
those incarcerated

866
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:32,565
only $10.80 a week
for work,

867
00:52:32,603 --> 00:52:36,300
you could end up
leaving prison in debt,

868
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,808
and then be forced
to commit a crime, you know,

869
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:41,311
in order to make restitution
which, of course,

870
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:45,213
could lead you back to prison
where you'd have to pay.

871
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:46,648
Huh?

872
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:50,313
I guess you'd call
that a vicious circle.

873
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:52,880
Give it up, boys.

874
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,352
Sister Pete,
this is Noel Behn

875
00:52:57,395 --> 00:52:59,226
from the Society
For Prisoners' Rights.

876
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,093
- Oh, hello.
- Good to meet you, Sister.

877
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:02,826
Come on in.

878
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:06,666
I asked Noel here to talk over
the Lemuel Idzik case.

879
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:08,365
What's to talk about?

880
00:53:08,405 --> 00:53:10,032
He confessed to the murder
of Omar White,

881
00:53:10,074 --> 00:53:11,336
and was sentenced to death.

882
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:13,366
The case should be reviewed
by the Appeals Court.

883
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,900
Why?

884
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:18,210
Idzik's lawyer slept through most of
the trial and the judge said nothing.

885
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:20,113
Justice by assembly line.

886
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,550
And Idzik made no protest?

887
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:24,713
The man's indifference
to his own fate suggests

888
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:26,518
some sort of
mental instability.

889
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:29,822
We'd like you
to determine the extent.

890
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,623
Well, you know me,

891
00:53:31,662 --> 00:53:34,426
if there's a way to get somebody
out of death row, I will find it.

892
00:53:34,465 --> 00:53:38,458
I wanted Omar White
to exterminate me.

893
00:53:38,502 --> 00:53:40,732
When he refused,
I killed him,

894
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:42,466
knowing
I'd be sent here,

895
00:53:42,506 --> 00:53:45,566
that the State would
do what Omar wouldn't.

896
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:49,568
So, all of this is an elaborate way
to commit suicide?

897
00:53:49,613 --> 00:53:52,013
You could say that.

898
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:56,281
Is that why you
killed Kareem Said?

899
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,447
No.

900
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:00,548
That was revenge.

901
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:03,549
Revenge?

902
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:06,392
What did Kareem Said
do to you?

903
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:15,299
Lemuel, clearly you have
made a choice to die.

904
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:20,470
Don't go to your grave without
anyone understanding the reason.

905
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:23,446
What did Kareem do to you

906
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,381
that was so terrible?

907
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,078
He bought me
a cup of coffee...

908
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,878
at an outdoor cafe
in Istanbul.

909
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:35,585
That was before
he'd converted to Islam.

910
00:54:35,626 --> 00:54:39,585
He was young,
arrogant, brilliant.

911
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:44,258
We had
a casual conversation,

912
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:47,998
during which he told me
about "Star-doom,"

913
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:50,006
about...

914
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,133
"Nightfall,"

915
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:54,041
you know, about how
the universe would end.

916
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:57,979
He was laughing
about it.

917
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:02,849
But his words...

918
00:55:04,354 --> 00:55:07,653
cut into my heart.

919
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:09,750
His words...

920
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:12,591
ravaged my soul!

921
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:16,029
His words...

922
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,293
killed me!

923
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:24,968
And you killed him.

924
00:55:25,008 --> 00:55:26,999
A little bizarre,
isn't it,

925
00:55:27,044 --> 00:55:28,875
how one man's
chatty conversation,

926
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:32,473
how one man's laughter
can level someone else?

927
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:35,777
When he walked away
from that table,

928
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:38,413
he probably forgot
about what we discussed.

929
00:55:38,455 --> 00:55:40,650
He certainly
forgot who I was.

930
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:44,354
It was a moment, you know,
one of many for him.

931
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:49,664
But for me it was the most
significant moment of my life.

932
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:58,239
And I can't help think
that by shooting Kareem Said,

933
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:01,904
I kept myself from doing
something far worse.

934
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,078
The death sentence
of Lemuel Idzik,

935
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,913
convicted of killing
a fellow inmate

936
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:10,784
at the Oswald Correctional Facility,
was overturned today.

937
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:13,119
What?
Motherfucker!

938
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:33,173
Come in.

939
00:56:35,779 --> 00:56:37,440
Come in.

940
00:56:42,953 --> 00:56:45,251
Listen...

941
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:47,189
I know you want to die.

942
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:52,388
The irony is, in Em City
you probably will...

943
00:56:52,429 --> 00:56:55,023
shanked, suffocated...

944
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:57,894
OD'd.

945
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:04,472
You know,
I was remembering

946
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:08,308
at Leo Glynn's funeral

947
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:11,974
why I built this place,

948
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:16,418
why I wanted to create
a better life for these guys.

949
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,490
It's because most likely

950
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:24,119
they'll never have
any other kind of life.

951
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:32,192
I've heard all about
your doomsday scenarios.

952
00:57:34,104 --> 00:57:36,937
The sun will cool,
the planets will darken,

953
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:38,965
man will become extinct.

954
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:43,145
Well, I say,
okay, so what?

955
00:57:44,781 --> 00:57:48,148
That won't happen for another
10 billion years or so.

956
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:50,016
We're alive now.

957
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:53,216
I mean,
we live in the now.

958
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:56,419
We have to grab the now
with both hands.

959
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,985
We have to move
through the light,

960
00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:01,930
be warmed by the sun...

961
00:58:02,032 --> 00:58:03,431
while we can.

962
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:05,832
And what about
the darkness?

963
00:58:08,671 --> 00:58:10,730
Shit, I don't know.

964
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:16,775
I mean,
someone or something

965
00:58:16,813 --> 00:58:18,610
set this whole thing
spinning.

966
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:22,345
I've got to believe that there's
a reason that we live...

967
00:58:22,385 --> 00:58:24,478
and a reason
that we leave.

968
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:31,459
To believe is to live,
Mr. McManus.

969
00:58:33,363 --> 00:58:36,264
Consider yourself lucky.

970
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:43,000
Some days I do.

971
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,012
Yo.

972
00:58:55,051 --> 00:58:57,417
Dad's coming to visit?

973
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,319
Well, not visit...

974
00:58:59,355 --> 00:59:01,289
exactly.

975
00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:08,088
Hey, yo, Dad,
check it out.

976
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,758
Look at that, huh?

977
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:12,393
Look at me
and my new best friend.

978
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:14,665
Don't use me
to taunt your father.

979
00:59:14,704 --> 00:59:16,433
Why not, man?
You hate him as much as I do.

980
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:17,963
No, I never
knew the man.

981
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:19,975
I just heard the stories
from your mom.

982
00:59:20,009 --> 00:59:21,806
Well, she's just got
the abridged version.

983
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:24,006
I've got 35 years
of gory details.

984
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:27,241
You fuckin' asshole!

985
00:59:27,283 --> 00:59:30,218
What's that word called
for when a son kills his father?

986
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:32,016
Patricide.

987
00:59:32,055 --> 00:59:33,989
Yeah, patricide.

988
00:59:34,023 --> 00:59:36,014
I like
the sound of that.

989
00:59:46,035 --> 00:59:49,436
You always did
look good in gray.

990
00:59:49,472 --> 00:59:51,497
What do you want,
slut?

991
00:59:53,743 --> 00:59:58,077
I assume you've heard that Cyril's
latest appeal was denied.

992
00:59:58,114 --> 01:00:01,550
Yeah, he fries on Sunday.

993
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:04,519
Sheamus, I want you
to visit him.

994
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:07,182
I want you to tell Cyril
how much you loved him.

995
01:00:07,223 --> 01:00:09,214
You mean lie?

996
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:12,092
That's something you've
always been good at.

997
01:00:12,128 --> 01:00:13,993
What do I get
in return?

998
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:18,592
The piece of mind
that your son

999
01:00:18,635 --> 01:00:20,967
went to his death
with a little comfort.

1000
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:23,802
I'll leave
the hand-holding to you.

1001
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,671
He'll get
no comfort from me.

1002
01:00:27,777 --> 01:00:30,337
Forget the beatings.

1003
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,406
Forget the verbal abuse
growing up.

1004
01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:36,509
Let's just focus on
the electroshock therapy, shall we?

1005
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,384
Putting Cyril
through all that torment.

1006
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:40,048
They said it was
the best treatment.

1007
01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:42,785
- I'm sure that was your concern!
- Fuck you!

1008
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:44,588
You know, the saddest thing,
Sheamus,

1009
01:00:44,627 --> 01:00:46,595
is that you had
two wonderful sons

1010
01:00:46,629 --> 01:00:48,529
and you destroyed
them both.

1011
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:52,524
When you die, when you're
looking for a little comfort,

1012
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:56,096
there will be no one
there who gives a shit!

1013
01:01:02,345 --> 01:01:05,678
Why don't you go suck off
your nigger boyfriend?

1014
01:01:20,396 --> 01:01:23,422
- Hey, "Skillinger."
- Schillinger.

1015
01:01:23,466 --> 01:01:24,956
Sorry.

1016
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:27,697
I got a job that
needs to be done,

1017
01:01:27,737 --> 01:01:29,568
and I got the cash
to pay for it.

1018
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:31,039
Yeah, what job?

1019
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:33,099
Kill Jahfree Neema.

1020
01:01:33,142 --> 01:01:34,632
No thanks.

1021
01:01:34,677 --> 01:01:37,805
I said I can pay.

1022
01:01:37,847 --> 01:01:38,973
Yeah.

1023
01:01:39,015 --> 01:01:40,846
And I said, no.

1024
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:43,511
Why don't you get your boy
Ryan to do the deed?

1025
01:01:43,553 --> 01:01:45,817
- Come on, "Skillinger."
- It's Schillinger!

1026
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,880
Just move the fuck on!

1027
01:01:52,562 --> 01:01:54,223
Seven-card bill.

1028
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:04,599
Hello there,
"brother man."

1029
01:02:06,009 --> 01:02:08,807
O'Reily, I got no quarrel
with you.

1030
01:02:08,845 --> 01:02:11,507
Oh, yes, you do!

1031
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,247
Hey!
Get off, get off!

1032
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:21,382
Get off, get off!

1033
01:02:21,424 --> 01:02:23,324
Fuck, Jesus Christ!

1034
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,658
We're almost finished.

1035
01:02:31,434 --> 01:02:33,493
There we go.

1036
01:02:33,536 --> 01:02:35,595
Okay.

1037
01:02:35,638 --> 01:02:38,630
Still, I'm keeping you
in until we take the stitches out.

1038
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:58,792
Guess you're not as quick
as you used to be, huh, Dad?

1039
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:01,126
Get the fuck
away from me.

1040
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:04,793
Hey, pal, I got no interest
in changing your bed pan.

1041
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:06,392
I just thought
you should know

1042
01:03:06,436 --> 01:03:08,233
that tomorrow's
Cyril's execution,

1043
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:10,739
and so far the courts
refuse to step in.

1044
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:14,777
Mm-hmm.

1045
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:18,409
You really don't
give a shit, do you?

1046
01:03:18,448 --> 01:03:22,179
I don't give a shit about
anything I can't control.

1047
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:23,685
Then you must not
care about anything.

1048
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,211
Will you get
the fuck away from me?

1049
01:03:26,255 --> 01:03:28,485
- Ryan!
- Yo.

1050
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:30,515
Come here, please.

1051
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:39,099
You tell me you want to be
an orderly to help people?

1052
01:03:39,135 --> 01:03:40,500
Not him.

1053
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:44,233
Hey, tomorrow Cyril's
going to die, all right?

1054
01:03:44,273 --> 01:03:46,537
You can trace back
all the shit that's come down,

1055
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:49,306
and dear ole fuckin' Dad
is at the center!

1056
01:03:49,345 --> 01:03:52,974
Maybe so, but that still doesn't
justify what you're plotting,

1057
01:03:53,015 --> 01:03:57,281
Ryan, no more than it did when
you had Cyril kill my husband!

1058
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:02,789
I watch you care
for your brother...

1059
01:04:04,227 --> 01:04:08,323
and you're so warm
and so sweet with him.

1060
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:12,862
And then you get this
look in your eye...

1061
01:04:12,902 --> 01:04:15,029
this dangerous,
terrifying look.

1062
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:21,608
There are moments
when I forgive you

1063
01:04:21,644 --> 01:04:23,908
for what you've done,

1064
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:26,141
and others when I can't.

1065
01:04:26,182 --> 01:04:29,743
And I want
to forgive you, Ryan.

1066
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,845
Help me to do that.

1067
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:37,318
How?

1068
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:41,023
Promise me that no harm
will come to your father.

1069
01:04:41,063 --> 01:04:42,792
Please.

1070
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:49,798
Let's just both put
the past in the past.

1071
01:05:08,157 --> 01:05:10,853
Here's a story and...

1072
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:12,554
it's true.

1073
01:05:12,595 --> 01:05:17,294
Last year, the United States Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia

1074
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:20,962
criticized the Catholic Church's
opposition to the death penalty.

1075
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:22,732
He believes Catholic judges

1076
01:05:22,772 --> 01:05:26,606
who don't support capital
punishment should resign.

1077
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:29,941
A devout Catholic himself,
Scalia has not demanded

1078
01:05:29,979 --> 01:05:32,379
judges who support
the Church's stand

1079
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,077
on abortion should resign.

1080
01:05:42,592 --> 01:05:45,993
Lopresti told me
Dad got stabbed.

1081
01:05:46,028 --> 01:05:48,019
Don't worry about Dad.

1082
01:05:49,832 --> 01:05:52,232
Is he gonna be okay?

1083
01:05:52,268 --> 01:05:53,997
Dr. Nathan's taking
good care of him.

1084
01:05:55,505 --> 01:05:58,167
I like Dr. Nathan.

1085
01:05:58,207 --> 01:05:59,799
Me, too.

1086
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:01,104
Me, too.

1087
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:07,982
That man's
taking notes again.

1088
01:06:08,017 --> 01:06:10,952
I told you, that's because
this time you're gonna...

1089
01:06:10,987 --> 01:06:13,455
get that special
E.C.T. Treatment.

1090
01:06:13,489 --> 01:06:15,616
Right.

1091
01:06:15,658 --> 01:06:17,717
Finally.

1092
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,421
Show time!

1093
01:06:21,163 --> 01:06:24,189
Any word
from the lawyer?

1094
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:25,564
Oh.

1095
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:42,714
See ya, Ryan.

1096
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:49,753
Yeah, I'll see ya.

1097
01:06:59,936 --> 01:07:02,666
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley

1098
01:07:02,705 --> 01:07:05,139
of the shadow of death,
I will fear now evil,

1099
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:06,903
for thou art with me.

1100
01:07:06,943 --> 01:07:09,810
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1101
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:12,473
Thou preparest
a table before me

1102
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:13,982
in the presence
of mine enemies.

1103
01:07:14,016 --> 01:07:16,382
Thou anointest
my head with oil."

1104
01:07:29,665 --> 01:07:33,294
"...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

1105
01:09:00,523 --> 01:09:02,423
Mom?

1106
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:04,119
Mom?

1107
01:09:06,028 --> 01:09:09,088
Mom, what's happening?

1108
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:11,497
Mom, what's...

1109
01:09:11,534 --> 01:09:13,764
What are they doing?

1110
01:09:13,803 --> 01:09:14,997
Ryan!

1111
01:09:22,478 --> 01:09:25,470
Ryan! Ryan!

1112
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:07,749
Ryan.

1113
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,417
Ryan.

1114
01:10:13,395 --> 01:10:16,364
I want to see Cyril.

1115
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:20,228
You're too late.

1116
01:10:29,612 --> 01:10:33,673
I did the best
I could for him...

1117
01:10:33,716 --> 01:10:36,651
and you, growing up.

1118
01:10:36,685 --> 01:10:38,585
I tried!

1119
01:10:39,822 --> 01:10:42,120
But I never caught
a break.

1120
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,151
Nothing ever went my way,
not one single time.

1121
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:51,964
And the day that...

1122
01:10:52,968 --> 01:10:54,959
your sister...

1123
01:10:55,004 --> 01:10:57,472
died...

1124
01:10:58,741 --> 01:11:02,802
was the day I found out
that Tessie had cancer.

1125
01:11:05,881 --> 01:11:08,076
I was scared.

1126
01:11:12,154 --> 01:11:14,122
You were afraid?

1127
01:11:14,156 --> 01:11:16,215
Yeah.

1128
01:11:16,258 --> 01:11:17,987
I don't want to die.

1129
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:24,294
Don't leave me, Ryan.

1130
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,994
Please, son.

1131
01:11:28,938 --> 01:11:31,406
I don't want to die alone.

1132
01:11:33,876 --> 01:11:35,673
Please.

1133
01:11:53,095 --> 01:11:55,154
No worry,

1134
01:11:55,197 --> 01:11:58,030
I won't let
that happen.

1135
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:00,399
I'm not going
anywhere, Dad.

1136
01:12:11,313 --> 01:12:13,508
Uh, is everybody ready?

1137
01:12:16,518 --> 01:12:18,543
James would, uh...

1138
01:12:18,587 --> 01:12:21,920
like to address
everybody.

1139
01:12:26,395 --> 01:12:28,192
Well...

1140
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:33,833
what I have
to say is goodbye.

1141
01:12:33,869 --> 01:12:38,306
As of today, I'll be
transferring to Unit F.

1142
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,537
You see,
I'm H.I.V. Positive.

1143
01:12:44,013 --> 01:12:46,379
Initially I blamed Cutler...

1144
01:12:46,415 --> 01:12:48,576
the guy who raped me.

1145
01:12:49,852 --> 01:12:51,479
But the truth is,

1146
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,750
this is my fault...

1147
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:59,489
because all the times
I had unprotected sex...

1148
01:12:59,528 --> 01:13:02,656
thinking I'd
never be the one

1149
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:04,689
to catch my dick
in the zipper.

1150
01:13:07,303 --> 01:13:10,932
And even though I know
I'm going to live a long time...

1151
01:13:12,508 --> 01:13:17,036
I also know this didn't
have to happen.

1152
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:24,017
Anyway...

1153
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:27,420
I'm glad I got to spend
some time with you guys...

1154
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:30,892
to see through
the window both ways.

1155
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:43,463
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1156
01:13:43,505 --> 01:13:47,805
Believe me, Vern, I wouldn't have
come unless I absolutely had to.

1157
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:49,902
How's the kike?

1158
01:13:49,945 --> 01:13:52,914
Irv's fine,
sends his love.

1159
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:57,418
Dad's dying...

1160
01:13:57,453 --> 01:13:59,444
lung cancer.

1161
01:13:59,488 --> 01:14:03,117
All those Chesterfields
finally caught up with him.

1162
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,721
He goes in and out
of consciousness,

1163
01:14:06,762 --> 01:14:08,389
but when he's awake,
he asks for you.

1164
01:14:09,698 --> 01:14:12,724
Horse shit.

1165
01:14:14,503 --> 01:14:17,768
You and I haven't been
in the same room for 20-odd years,

1166
01:14:17,806 --> 01:14:21,242
but I felt I should come, see
if you had a message for the old man.

1167
01:14:21,276 --> 01:14:22,937
A message?

1168
01:14:27,016 --> 01:14:29,917
I've hated him
all my life.

1169
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:34,589
Well...

1170
01:14:35,824 --> 01:14:37,792
no reason
to stop now.

1171
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:43,930
I have been corresponding
with Carrie's folks in Montana,

1172
01:14:43,966 --> 01:14:46,230
sending money for the baby.

1173
01:14:46,268 --> 01:14:48,862
They mailed me pictures
of Jewel's first birthday.

1174
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:50,462
I thought you might like them.

1175
01:14:52,408 --> 01:14:54,638
Greta...

1176
01:14:56,145 --> 01:14:58,841
what I did,

1177
01:14:58,881 --> 01:15:01,145
shutting you out
after your wedding,

1178
01:15:01,183 --> 01:15:03,014
I had to.

1179
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,880
And I despised you
for decades.

1180
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:13,225
But now all
I can say is shalom.

1181
01:15:14,596 --> 01:15:16,587
Shalom, Vern.

1182
01:15:30,245 --> 01:15:31,769
Agent Taylor.

1183
01:15:31,814 --> 01:15:35,181
Mr. Beecher,
please sit down.

1184
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:42,455
How's it going?

1185
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:44,186
Fine.

1186
01:15:46,562 --> 01:15:49,497
How's your daughter
Holly?

1187
01:15:49,531 --> 01:15:51,590
You know,
the reason I ask is

1188
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:54,397
one of the few joys
of this job

1189
01:15:54,436 --> 01:15:58,338
is reuniting kidnapped children
with their parents.

1190
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:03,305
She's adjusting,
all things considered.

1191
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,012
It must be tough on her,
though,

1192
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:11,509
I mean, you out of prison one day,
back inside the next.

1193
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:14,078
How would you like another
chance at being paroled?

1194
01:16:14,123 --> 01:16:17,024
I can make it happen.

1195
01:16:17,059 --> 01:16:18,390
How?

1196
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:21,191
If you cooperate with us,
we'll see to it

1197
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:23,323
that this latest charge
against you evaporates.

1198
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:25,697
If this is about Keller
murdering Brice Tibbetts...

1199
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:26,996
That's a dead issue!

1200
01:16:27,035 --> 01:16:29,401
But Keller did kill
two other men...

1201
01:16:29,438 --> 01:16:31,303
Byam Lewis and Mark Carocci.

1202
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,671
And Keller's got an ego.

1203
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,734
And I'm sure that in some point
in your time together,

1204
01:16:35,777 --> 01:16:37,335
he must have mentioned
something.

1205
01:16:37,379 --> 01:16:39,540
You mean come out
and admit his guilt?

1206
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:42,573
No, he's too sly
for that.

1207
01:16:42,618 --> 01:16:44,950
But he suggested
his complicity.

1208
01:16:48,423 --> 01:16:49,913
Yes.

1209
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,153
You see,
that could be enough...

1210
01:16:52,194 --> 01:16:55,322
if you and I figure out
how to phrase it correctly.

1211
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:57,832
Like you did
with Jerry Heeken?

1212
01:16:57,866 --> 01:16:59,561
Heeken's a punk.

1213
01:16:59,601 --> 01:17:02,536
But you're a former lawyer
with children.

1214
01:17:02,571 --> 01:17:04,732
That Keller
fucked up the ass.

1215
01:17:04,773 --> 01:17:06,934
You're back in Oz
because of him.

1216
01:17:06,975 --> 01:17:09,409
You testify,
you go free.

1217
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:10,934
He dies.

1218
01:17:12,014 --> 01:17:13,982
What is it about Keller,

1219
01:17:14,016 --> 01:17:16,109
Agent Taylor,
that obsesses you?

1220
01:17:17,419 --> 01:17:19,887
I want justice
for those murdered men.

1221
01:17:21,456 --> 01:17:24,254
Look, I may have
been disbarred,

1222
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:26,124
but there's still enough
lawyer in me to know

1223
01:17:26,161 --> 01:17:27,992
that justice doesn't
come through deceit

1224
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:29,691
by my rephrasing
what Keller said.

1225
01:17:29,731 --> 01:17:31,858
- He's guilty!
- I know.

1226
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,800
Freedom, Beecher.

1227
01:17:33,835 --> 01:17:37,271
Tucking your little girl
Holly in at night.

1228
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:42,707
- Oh, that's a nice touch.
- What's that?

1229
01:17:42,744 --> 01:17:45,042
Making sure he saw us
talking together.

1230
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,105
Will you cooperate?

1231
01:17:54,923 --> 01:17:56,550
I have to
think about it.

1232
01:17:56,592 --> 01:17:58,253
Well, don't
take too long.

1233
01:17:58,293 --> 01:18:00,124
Now, that he's seen us
chatting together,

1234
01:18:00,162 --> 01:18:01,652
he'll start to sweat,

1235
01:18:01,697 --> 01:18:03,892
wondering whether you're
going to give him up or not.

1236
01:18:03,966 --> 01:18:08,266
To guarantee your silence,
he might do something nasty.

1237
01:18:08,303 --> 01:18:11,932
So, the little stroll wasn't
to scare him, it was to scare me.

1238
01:18:11,974 --> 01:18:15,501
Jesus, you cover
every angle, don't you?

1239
01:18:17,012 --> 01:18:18,946
I try.

1240
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:28,580
Now, look, tonight's
your big premiere...

1241
01:18:30,325 --> 01:18:33,419
and Beecher's big finale.

1242
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:36,294
I've got a little opening night
present for you.

1243
01:18:36,331 --> 01:18:38,799
Right before
your fight scene,

1244
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:42,030
instead of handing
you the prop knife...

1245
01:18:43,972 --> 01:18:46,270
I'm gonna give you
a real one.

1246
01:18:46,308 --> 01:18:48,606
You get to stab
that sucker right there

1247
01:18:48,643 --> 01:18:50,508
on the stage in front
of everybody.

1248
01:18:52,013 --> 01:18:56,279
And all we say is, like,
"It was an accident."

1249
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,188
So, if I tell Taylor
what he wants to hear,

1250
01:19:01,222 --> 01:19:03,713
I'll be home
in a matter of weeks,

1251
01:19:03,758 --> 01:19:06,852
while Keller heads back
to death row,

1252
01:19:06,895 --> 01:19:09,159
marking off the calendar.

1253
01:19:09,197 --> 01:19:12,496
And all you have to do
is subvert the truth.

1254
01:19:12,534 --> 01:19:14,627
The question is...

1255
01:19:14,669 --> 01:19:16,967
can you live the rest
of your life knowing

1256
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:19,303
it was built on a lie?

1257
01:19:19,341 --> 01:19:22,799
But it's not
a lie exactly.

1258
01:19:22,844 --> 01:19:24,937
I mean,
Keller is guilty.

1259
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,710
Yes, but it hasn't
been proven.

1260
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:29,683
Your saying that
he said something

1261
01:19:29,718 --> 01:19:31,015
he didn't say
is not proof.

1262
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:34,180
Tobias, we live
in a nation of laws,

1263
01:19:34,222 --> 01:19:35,689
some of which are
inspired

1264
01:19:35,724 --> 01:19:37,351
and some of which are
just lousy.

1265
01:19:37,392 --> 01:19:40,828
But we can't abandon
our moral code

1266
01:19:40,862 --> 01:19:42,659
whenever it's convenient.

1267
01:19:42,697 --> 01:19:46,098
Then we might as well
just open all the gates

1268
01:19:46,134 --> 01:19:47,795
of all the prisons.

1269
01:19:51,106 --> 01:19:53,870
I want to be
with my children.

1270
01:19:56,444 --> 01:19:59,436
My dear Tobias...

1271
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:02,746
in all my years
sitting across that desk,

1272
01:20:02,784 --> 01:20:05,150
I have learned one thing...

1273
01:20:05,186 --> 01:20:08,019
Most people who come
to me with a problem

1274
01:20:08,056 --> 01:20:11,492
have already made up their minds
how they'll proceed.

1275
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:14,154
They're just here hoping
I'll agree with them,

1276
01:20:14,195 --> 01:20:16,857
hoping I'll make them
feel better.

1277
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:19,128
I can't do that
with you.

1278
01:20:24,272 --> 01:20:25,296
I gotta go.

1279
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,035
Tonight's opening night
of "Macbeth."

1280
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:29,236
I have to get ready.

1281
01:20:45,693 --> 01:20:47,957
- Miguel, are you okay?
- Hmm?

1282
01:20:47,996 --> 01:20:50,931
Just a little
opening night jitters,

1283
01:20:50,965 --> 01:20:53,695
A little
cotton-cotton mouth.

1284
01:20:53,735 --> 01:20:55,430
Okay. You set?

1285
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,631
- Let's make theatrical history.
- All right!

1286
01:20:57,672 --> 01:20:59,503
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

1287
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:01,634
I'm so excited
I'm gonna bust my buttons.

1288
01:21:01,676 --> 01:21:03,041
Don't do that,
it's a rental.

1289
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:04,943
All right, everybody,
we worked hard,

1290
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:06,776
so now's the time
to have fun.

1291
01:21:06,815 --> 01:21:08,612
So, if you flub a line,
just keep going.

1292
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:11,346
If you miss a cue,
don't panic.

1293
01:21:11,386 --> 01:21:13,547
I'm very proud
of all of you.

1294
01:21:13,588 --> 01:21:15,647
Break a leg.

1295
01:21:18,393 --> 01:21:21,021
Have a good show,
Beecher.

1296
01:21:27,202 --> 01:21:29,762
- Miguel, dim the house lights.
- Hmm?

1297
01:21:43,751 --> 01:21:46,914
Good evening, and welcome
to the premiere production

1298
01:21:46,955 --> 01:21:48,923
of the Oswald Players.

1299
01:21:48,957 --> 01:21:51,687
Before we begin, there are
a few changes in the program.

1300
01:21:51,726 --> 01:21:55,594
The second "weird sister"
will be played by Reggie Rawls

1301
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:57,291
instead of Chico Guerra.

1302
01:21:57,332 --> 01:21:59,823
Banquo will be played
by Tom Smeeding

1303
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:02,063
instead of
Agamemnon Busmalis.

1304
01:22:02,103 --> 01:22:04,298
And Norman Duttweiler
will play King Duncan

1305
01:22:04,339 --> 01:22:06,273
instead of Burr Redding.

1306
01:22:06,307 --> 01:22:09,276
I would also like to say
that warden Leo Glynn

1307
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:12,108
was a great supporter
of bringing the arts to Oz.

1308
01:22:12,147 --> 01:22:16,641
So we dedicate tonight's
performance in his memory

1309
01:22:16,684 --> 01:22:20,950
and also to the memory
of Cyril O'Reily.

1310
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:22,752
Thank you.

1311
01:22:30,865 --> 01:22:33,197
They spent some money
on this shit.

1312
01:22:36,704 --> 01:22:39,434
When shall we three
meet again?

1313
01:22:39,474 --> 01:22:42,136
In thunder,
lightning or in rain?

1314
01:22:42,177 --> 01:22:44,611
When the hurlyburly's done,

1315
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:47,843
when the battle's lost
and won.

1316
01:22:47,882 --> 01:22:51,010
That will be
the set of sun.

1317
01:22:51,052 --> 01:22:53,850
- Where the place?
- Upon the heath.

1318
01:22:53,888 --> 01:22:56,721
There to meet
with Macbeth.

1319
01:23:00,728 --> 01:23:02,889
...everlasting bonfire.

1320
01:23:02,931 --> 01:23:07,027
Anon, anon!

1321
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:10,231
I pray you,
remember the porter.

1322
01:23:14,108 --> 01:23:16,133
Hie thee hither,

1323
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:19,840
that I may pour
my spirits in thine ear

1324
01:23:19,881 --> 01:23:23,214
and chastise with the valor
of my tongue

1325
01:23:23,251 --> 01:23:26,049
all that impedes thee
from the golden round

1326
01:23:26,087 --> 01:23:29,056
which fate
and metaphysical aid

1327
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:31,923
doth seem to have
thee crowned withal.

1328
01:23:37,699 --> 01:23:39,690
What is thy name?

1329
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:43,533
Thou'lt be afraid
to hear it.

1330
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:46,039
No, though thy callest
thyself a hotter name,

1331
01:23:46,074 --> 01:23:48,008
than any is in hell.

1332
01:23:51,779 --> 01:23:53,508
My name's Macbeth.

1333
01:24:10,665 --> 01:24:14,328
Toby, I've got a plan
on a way to get Schillinger

1334
01:24:14,369 --> 01:24:15,631
out of your life forever.

1335
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:19,470
I don't want to hear it.
Just give me my prop!

1336
01:24:37,325 --> 01:24:40,783
Thou was born of women,
but swords I smile at.

1337
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:42,659
Weapons laugh to scorn,

1338
01:24:42,697 --> 01:24:46,133
brandished by man
that's of a woman born.

1339
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:47,725
Turn!

1340
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:49,930
Hell-hound, turn!

1341
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:55,065
Of all men else
I have avoided thee.

1342
01:24:56,444 --> 01:24:58,605
But get thee back.

1343
01:24:58,646 --> 01:25:01,979
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

1344
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:06,112
I have no words!
My voice is in my sword,

1345
01:25:06,154 --> 01:25:09,055
thou bloodier villain than terms
can give thee out.

1346
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:11,354
Stick him, stick him!

1347
01:25:17,432 --> 01:25:19,093
You're a dead man,
sweetpea.

1348
01:25:25,807 --> 01:25:27,798
That cocksucker.

1349
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:42,021
- Dr. Nathan!
- That motherfucker's dead!

1350
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:56,395
As you know, we're investigating
what happened on the stage,

1351
01:25:56,437 --> 01:25:59,372
trying to determine
whether Schillinger's death

1352
01:25:59,407 --> 01:26:01,500
was accidental
or intentional.

1353
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:03,635
Chris Keller says
he handed you the knife

1354
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:05,509
just before your entrance.

1355
01:26:05,546 --> 01:26:07,878
How did a real knife
get on the prop table?

1356
01:26:07,915 --> 01:26:09,348
I don't know.

1357
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:11,944
Suzanne Fitzgerald says
there were no problems

1358
01:26:11,986 --> 01:26:13,283
during the rehearsals.

1359
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:15,653
Schillinger and Keller
seemed very friendly.

1360
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,954
They were horsing around
and stuff.

1361
01:26:17,992 --> 01:26:19,619
What about Beecher?

1362
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,287
He-he seemed fine.

1363
01:26:21,329 --> 01:26:25,732
Distant, but not in the least bit
confrontational.

1364
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:27,792
All of which jibes
with the statement you made

1365
01:26:27,835 --> 01:26:30,201
immediately after
you stabbed Schillinger.

1366
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,230
Do you have anything
to add at this time?

1367
01:26:33,274 --> 01:26:35,401
No, sir.

1368
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:37,001
Okay.

1369
01:26:37,044 --> 01:26:42,346
We've decided to rule that
Schillinger's death was accidental.

1370
01:26:42,383 --> 01:26:44,715
You're coming back
to Em City.

1371
01:26:46,687 --> 01:26:48,314
Thank you.

1372
01:26:49,323 --> 01:26:51,188
Thank you, all.

1373
01:27:07,975 --> 01:27:09,704
What are you
doing here?

1374
01:27:09,744 --> 01:27:12,304
I asked Querns
to transfer me back.

1375
01:27:12,346 --> 01:27:14,007
I guess he
convinced McManus.

1376
01:27:14,048 --> 01:27:17,211
Even made us roomies.

1377
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:19,719
- No.
- Yeah.

1378
01:27:19,754 --> 01:27:22,314
Nothing has changed,
Chris.

1379
01:27:22,356 --> 01:27:25,792
I know, you've got the top bunk
just like before.

1380
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:28,819
I mean my feelings
haven't changed.

1381
01:27:29,831 --> 01:27:31,196
I'm gonna
go to McManus,

1382
01:27:31,232 --> 01:27:32,699
ask him to move me
to another pod,

1383
01:27:32,733 --> 01:27:34,291
Probably move me
to a jammed pod.

1384
01:27:34,335 --> 01:27:35,768
Toby, goddamn it.

1385
01:27:35,803 --> 01:27:37,464
Look, will you get it
through your head,

1386
01:27:37,505 --> 01:27:39,632
I don't want you
in my life.

1387
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:43,942
After everything
I've done for you.

1388
01:27:43,978 --> 01:27:47,038
Yeah, like almost getting me
sent to death row.

1389
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:49,811
If it weren't for me, you'd be in
the morgue, instead of Schillinger.

1390
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:52,376
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

1391
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:54,251
But if you think I got
any satisfaction

1392
01:27:54,288 --> 01:27:56,483
out of killing him,
you're wrong.

1393
01:27:56,524 --> 01:27:58,492
You don't know me
at all.

1394
01:27:58,526 --> 01:28:00,926
I don't know you?

1395
01:28:00,962 --> 01:28:03,055
I know you're free
of that Nazi fuck!

1396
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:08,062
No, I'm not.

1397
01:28:09,637 --> 01:28:12,071
No more free than
I am of his two sons,

1398
01:28:12,106 --> 01:28:14,233
or Metzger...

1399
01:28:14,275 --> 01:28:16,266
or Cathy Rockwell.

1400
01:28:23,184 --> 01:28:26,347
Chris, after six years
in this place...

1401
01:28:27,788 --> 01:28:29,949
I'm not sure about
anything anymore.

1402
01:28:31,192 --> 01:28:33,456
Heaven, justice,

1403
01:28:34,529 --> 01:28:37,589
truth.

1404
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:42,035
The only thing
I believe in is life.

1405
01:28:43,037 --> 01:28:45,028
Every life is precious.

1406
01:28:45,072 --> 01:28:46,767
Not just yours or mine,

1407
01:28:46,807 --> 01:28:49,503
but every single person
on the planet who's breathing,

1408
01:28:49,544 --> 01:28:51,671
their lives are precious.

1409
01:28:53,414 --> 01:28:55,712
And the loss
of a single life,

1410
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,981
even in Oz,
is my loss, too.

1411
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:03,184
Well, that's bullshit.

1412
01:29:03,224 --> 01:29:06,216
The only thing
that matters is you and me.

1413
01:29:07,595 --> 01:29:09,961
I don't expect you
to understand.

1414
01:29:09,997 --> 01:29:12,488
You kill for sport.

1415
01:29:12,533 --> 01:29:14,763
I don't understand?

1416
01:29:14,802 --> 01:29:18,761
I'm not the one
who got here by accident, pal.

1417
01:29:18,806 --> 01:29:21,400
I kill because I have to.

1418
01:29:21,442 --> 01:29:23,137
I kill what stands
in my way...

1419
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:26,977
like the Aryans.

1420
01:29:27,014 --> 01:29:29,312
What?

1421
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:31,113
What about the Aryans?

1422
01:29:31,152 --> 01:29:32,915
That they're no threat
to us anymore.

1423
01:29:32,954 --> 01:29:34,615
I took care of that.

1424
01:29:34,655 --> 01:29:36,623
How? How'd you
take care of it?

1425
01:29:36,657 --> 01:29:38,750
- Never mind, kiss me.
- Wait.

1426
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:46,523
- Answer me this first, okay?
- Hmm?

1427
01:29:47,969 --> 01:29:50,164
I want you
to be honest, okay?

1428
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:57,241
Did you purposely
fuck up my parole?

1429
01:30:12,259 --> 01:30:14,784
Toby, I couldn't face
the rest of my life

1430
01:30:14,829 --> 01:30:16,820
living in here
without you.

1431
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,533
Don't you see?
I did what I did out of love.

1432
01:30:24,038 --> 01:30:27,337
If you really love me,

1433
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:30,105
then leave me alone.

1434
01:30:35,549 --> 01:30:37,244
I can't.

1435
01:30:37,284 --> 01:30:39,684
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1436
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,153
I loved alcohol.

1437
01:30:41,188 --> 01:30:43,383
I loved heroin.

1438
01:30:43,424 --> 01:30:47,485
I had to put them behind me
because they were poison.

1439
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:49,519
Death.

1440
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:55,961
You are death.

1441
01:30:57,405 --> 01:30:59,134
Let me live.

1442
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,347
I can't.

1443
01:31:14,388 --> 01:31:16,356
Motherfucker!

1444
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:19,052
Toby, I love you.

1445
01:31:19,093 --> 01:31:21,288
Beecher, don't!

1446
01:31:21,328 --> 01:31:24,161
No! No!

1447
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:25,722
No!

1448
01:31:46,654 --> 01:31:49,953
God is a funny fellow,
Sister.

1449
01:31:51,826 --> 01:31:56,092
See, I decided this morning
to cooperate with the F.B.I.

1450
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:58,928
- To help them convict Keller.
- Oh?

1451
01:31:58,966 --> 01:32:03,130
And now,
with Keller dead...

1452
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:06,139
that opportunity
is gone.

1453
01:32:06,173 --> 01:32:09,631
And with it
my chance for freedom.

1454
01:32:09,677 --> 01:32:14,740
In fact, I may be facing
the death penalty

1455
01:32:14,782 --> 01:32:16,443
for Keller's murder.

1456
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:18,918
You didn't push him,
did you?

1457
01:32:18,953 --> 01:32:20,750
No.

1458
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:26,726
Well, let's hope this time
the truth works for you.

1459
01:32:26,761 --> 01:32:31,255
You know, he said he did
what he did out of love.

1460
01:32:31,298 --> 01:32:33,493
Oh, love is used

1461
01:32:33,534 --> 01:32:36,628
as an excuse
for so many things.

1462
01:32:38,539 --> 01:32:40,268
No.

1463
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:44,576
He really did
love me, Sister.

1464
01:32:44,612 --> 01:32:46,409
Yes.

1465
01:32:47,782 --> 01:32:50,080
And I loved him.

1466
01:32:52,753 --> 01:32:56,985
When God was designing
the universe...

1467
01:32:57,024 --> 01:32:59,686
why did he make something
so wonderful

1468
01:32:59,727 --> 01:33:03,629
so fucking painful?

1469
01:33:03,664 --> 01:33:06,656
I think he thought
we could handle it.

1470
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,292
Beecher!

1471
01:33:08,335 --> 01:33:11,202
I'm going to move you
back to Unit J.

1472
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:12,796
I'm concerned
about the Aryans

1473
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,831
taking revenge on you
for Schillinger.

1474
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:17,469
I said the same thing
to Keller, and he said,

1475
01:33:17,511 --> 01:33:20,071
"Don't worry,
I've handled the Aryans."

1476
01:33:20,114 --> 01:33:22,514
What did he mean
by that?

1477
01:33:34,695 --> 01:33:36,595
Hey, Andenaur.

1478
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,097
Check it out.
You've got a package.

1479
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:43,236
Hmm, no name...

1480
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,397
no return address.

1481
01:33:50,711 --> 01:33:52,338
What the fuck
is this?

1482
01:33:52,379 --> 01:33:54,040
I don't know.

1483
01:34:07,027 --> 01:34:10,929
- They're all dead?
- Yes, plus two C.O.'s.

1484
01:34:10,965 --> 01:34:12,455
- From what?
- I'm not sure.

1485
01:34:12,499 --> 01:34:14,865
But it could be any number
of toxins or chemicals.

1486
01:34:14,902 --> 01:34:16,995
I cordoned off the area.
I've got to tell you,

1487
01:34:17,037 --> 01:34:19,403
- this is way beyond my expertise.
- What do we do?

1488
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,998
Call the state
bio-terrorism unit

1489
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:24,101
and clear out
the entire complex fast!

1490
01:34:24,144 --> 01:34:26,669
Proceed immediately
to Level One.

1491
01:34:26,714 --> 01:34:28,648
Emergency evacuation.

1492
01:34:28,682 --> 01:34:30,240
Where are we going
to take them?

1493
01:34:30,284 --> 01:34:31,751
Beats the shit
out of me.

1494
01:34:31,785 --> 01:34:34,720
All I've been told is
the move is temporary.

1495
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:36,416
We'll be back someday.

1496
01:34:36,457 --> 01:34:37,947
Emergency evacuation.

1497
01:34:37,992 --> 01:34:40,187
Proceed immediately
to Level One.

1498
01:34:56,977 --> 01:34:59,207
Come on, move it!

1499
01:35:02,216 --> 01:35:04,616
Come on, ladies,
let's move!

1500
01:35:14,728 --> 01:35:17,219
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!

1501
01:35:20,301 --> 01:35:23,168
Move to the back
of the bus first.

1502
01:35:23,203 --> 01:35:25,034
Move to the back
of the bus.

1503
01:36:18,859 --> 01:36:20,793
Count!

1504
01:36:20,828 --> 01:36:23,456
A lot of people thought we'd
never re-open "Emerald City."

1505
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,491
- I killed a man.
- I know.

1506
01:36:28,535 --> 01:36:31,095
- Fuck you.
- Help!

1507
01:36:31,138 --> 01:36:32,935
Lights out,
O'Riely.

1508
01:36:32,973 --> 01:36:34,873
Settle down!

1509
01:36:34,908 --> 01:36:36,341
Officer!

1510
01:36:44,585 --> 01:36:46,485
You are to follow routine.

1511
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,580
We tell you when to sleep,

1512
01:36:49,623 --> 01:36:51,147
when to eat,

1513
01:36:51,191 --> 01:36:53,421
when to piss.

1514
01:37:22,589 --> 01:37:25,490
So, what have we learned?

1515
01:37:25,526 --> 01:37:27,494
What's the lesson for today,

1516
01:37:27,528 --> 01:37:31,760
for all the never-ending days
and restless nights in Oz?

1517
01:37:31,799 --> 01:37:34,700
That morality is transient?

1518
01:37:34,735 --> 01:37:39,331
That virtue cannot exist
without violence?

1519
01:37:39,373 --> 01:37:43,605
That to be honest
is to be flawed?

1520
01:37:43,644 --> 01:37:45,908
That the giving
and taking of love

1521
01:37:45,946 --> 01:37:48,938
both debases
and elevates us?

1522
01:37:48,982 --> 01:37:51,951
That God or Allah or Yahweh

1523
01:37:51,985 --> 01:37:57,685
has answers to questions
we dare not even ask?

1524
01:37:57,724 --> 01:37:59,316
The story is simple.

1525
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,125
A man lives in prison
and dies.

1526
01:38:03,163 --> 01:38:06,690
How he dies...
that's easy.

1527
01:38:06,733 --> 01:38:11,136
The who and the why
is the complex part...

1528
01:38:12,139 --> 01:38:14,801
the human part...

1529
01:38:15,809 --> 01:38:21,111
the only part
worth knowing.

1530
01:38:24,852 --> 01:38:26,513
Peace.
