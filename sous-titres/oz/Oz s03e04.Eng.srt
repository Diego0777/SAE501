1
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:39,973
Then the Lord said:

2
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:43,015
"I have seen the affliction of my people
who are in Egypt...

3
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:46,314
"and have heard their cries
because of their taskmasters.

4
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:49,549
"I know their suffering
and have come down...

5
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,749
"to deliver them out of the hands
of the Egyptians...

6
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:57,388
"and to bring them up out of that land
to a good and broad land.

7
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:00,926
"A land flowing with milk and honey."

8
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,827
Yeah.

9
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:07,337
God sends Moses to be the deliverer,
then throws a curveball.

10
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:11,938
God hardens Pharaoh's heart,
so Pharaoh won't let the Israelites go.

11
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:16,304
"Moses, set my people free.
Pharaoh, keep them captive."

12
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,249
Hey, God, whose side are you on?

13
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:24,256
Schillinger, congratulations.

14
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,047
For what?

15
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:29,493
It's a boy. A bouncing baby boy.

16
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:32,456
Your son arrived yesterday.

17
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:33,760
Which unit's he in?

18
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,098
Your favorite. Emerald City.

19
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,538
I got to see Glynn. Now.

20
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:43,235
Beecher, Keller, and O'Reily have been
waiting at the gate to fuck with me.

21
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,507
Now McManus gives them my boy
on a silver platter.

22
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:51,116
Your daughter was attacked, right?
She was beaten, raped.

23
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:55,377
You know what it is
to wanna protect your own.

24
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,291
And you're asking me to...

25
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,088
Put Andy in unit B with me.

26
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:05,996
You must really love your son, Schillinger,
to come in here and ask me for a favor.

27
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,736
It must be chewing up your insides
to have to stand here in my office...

28
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,765
begging me for your son's life.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,707
'Cause this is what you're doing,
right? Begging?

30
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,134
Yes.

31
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,805
Think of all the times
I needed something from you...

32
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:25,375
and you just sit here with that stupid-ass
grin on your face singing "doodah."

33
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:27,179
This is my son, God damn it.

34
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,217
- I thought you had two sons.
- Yeah, I do.

35
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:35,488
Maybe you'll be luckier with the second.
Take him away.

36
00:03:55,815 --> 00:04:00,514
Why would McManus put
Schillinger's kid here knowing the history?

37
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,019
- You think he's trying to set us up?
- No.

38
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,193
McManus hates that Nazi fuck
more than we do.

39
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,192
Maybe he's looking for us
to come up with the right move.

40
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,290
Right move, what's that?
You think he wants us to whack the kid?

41
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,359
No. Schillinger hates
that his son uses drugs.

42
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,401
Andy boy's been here a few days...

43
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:22,407
and he's already bought
a shitload of tits off of me.

44
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,842
So what do you say
we let Andy boy suck on that tit till he ODs?

45
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:27,072
Or...

46
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,711
Or what?

47
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:36,054
O'Reily, I need some more of that good shit.

48
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,217
Coming right up, buddy boy.

49
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,698
Yo, Vern! Nice fucking kid.

50
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:56,103
Andrew!

51
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,281
Hey, Dad.

52
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,815
You piece of shit.

53
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,085
- Hey, Lopresti.
- Yeah?

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,427
Does this fucking prison
still have a no-drug policy?

55
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:17,588
Yeah.

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,667
Come with me.

57
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,392
Fuck you, Dad!

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,354
I want my son in your rehab group.

59
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,190
That's fine, Vern.

60
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:49,388
But an addict will only quit doing drugs
when he decides it's time.

61
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,763
You ought to get curtains.

62
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,998
- Poor Vern. I heard about his son.
- Listen, Tobias...

63
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:08,370
I'm gonna bring Andrew into the group.
I hope that won't be a problem for you.

64
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:11,508
Not at all. I'll look forward to it.

65
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,380
Yeah, good.
Everybody, let's welcome Andrew.

66
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,692
So, Andrew...

67
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,294
the idea here
is for us to talk about ourselves...

68
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:29,401
our feelings, our addictions...

69
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,665
in the hope that we can find the cause.

70
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,266
So why don't you tell us
what you're addicted to.

71
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:37,843
Go fuck yourself.

72
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:41,039
Scumbag! This is a nun.
You don't talk to her that way.

73
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,638
Yeah? Fuck you, too.

74
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:43,978
Fuck me? Fuck you.

75
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,813
- Wait a minute!
- Back off.

76
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,054
Jesus fucking Christ! What is this bullshit?

77
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,783
Come on, you fuck.

78
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,957
Hey, you were supposed to punch me
in the stomach.

79
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,758
Had to look legit.
Like Mark Mack's nose, right?

80
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,565
- Where's the kid?
- He's there.

81
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:12,209
- What do you mean, no more tits?
- I got a lot of customers.

82
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:15,179
You're burning through my inventory
like a motherfucker.

83
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:18,376
So until a new shipment comes in,
you're cut off.

84
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,612
Fuck you. You ain't the only one dealing...

85
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:25,587
Hey, there's me, and there's them.

86
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:31,255
I know, based on your beliefs, you ain't
trafficking with anyone who ain't your color.

87
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,101
Hey, you okay?

88
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,303
Can you get me some tits, man?

89
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:46,638
Sorry.

90
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,648
You must think I'm an idiot.

91
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:54,551
You want me to move Keller out of your pod
and move Andrew Schillinger in?

92
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:58,148
You're wondering what I'll do to
the son of the guy who double-fucked me.

93
00:07:58,224 --> 00:07:59,384
It crossed my mind.

94
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,121
McManus, the kid's been here
how many days?

95
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:04,663
I haven't hurt him,
though I've had opportunities.

96
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:08,394
The truth is, after seeing him in group,
my heart goes out to Andrew.

97
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,402
With a fuck like Schillinger for a father...

98
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,665
you can understand
why a kid would turn to drugs.

99
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,764
God knows I've been there.

100
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,443
I think I can help him.

101
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,509
I want to help him.

102
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,376
Look, Beecher...

103
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,584
Sister Pete says you stood up for him.

104
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:37,956
Andrew's sharing a pod with another Aryan.
Schillinger's told his pals to ignore him...

105
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:42,363
so the kid's becoming more and
more isolated, and you don't want that.

106
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,900
Not that I would pretend to know
what you do want...

107
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,532
or why you brought him to Em City
in the first place.

108
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,473
You must've been a pretty good lawyer.

109
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,068
You can be fairly persuasive
when you want to be.

110
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:54,976
When it's important.

111
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,018
He gets hurt, it's your ass.

112
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,786
Little Andrew is gonna be as safe
as if he was in his mother's arms.

113
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:25,135
Hey. By the way, thanks for hitting that guy.

114
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,706
You know, standing up for me.

115
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:29,776
It's okay.

116
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,544
I know what it's like to be
on the bottom bunk.

117
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,784
You got any tattoos?

118
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,815
Yeah, a couple.

119
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,530
- Very nice.
- How about you?

120
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,172
I got one.

121
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,137
Yeah, let me see.

122
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,478
Someday. We don't know
each other that well yet.

123
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,253
Plague.

124
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:19,054
God plagues the mighty Pharaoh
for not letting the Israelites go.

125
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,599
God smites Pharaoh
with the first of 10 disasters.

126
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:28,806
One morning, old boy Pharaoh
strolls down to the beach for a swim...

127
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,606
for a tan, something.

128
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,412
He goes down, checks it.

129
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:43,318
And all the water in the Nile
has turned to blood.

130
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:50,721
McManus, be in my office at noon.

131
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:51,986
What for?

132
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,432
To meet the president of the officers' union
and the state's attorney.

133
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,594
- Might wanna have your lawyer present.
- Why?

134
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,434
Claire Howell is suing you
for sexual harassment.

135
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,530
What?

136
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:05,703
Should've told me when you asked me
to fire her that you'd been fucking her.

137
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:17,386
As head of the officers' union, I want
assurances that such things don't happen.

138
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:21,223
All staff members are gonna have
to undergo intense sensitivity training.

139
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:24,525
And I want Officer Claire Howell
immediately reinstated in her job.

140
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,896
Wait a minute, Mr. Strauch,
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves.

141
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,697
My client did not harass Officer Howell.

142
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,068
There are inmates who will testify...

143
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,199
to having seen Mr. McManus
force himself on her in his office.

144
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,709
If anyone was the aggressor here,
it was Claire.

145
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,939
She came into my office, she asked me out.

146
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,642
- Dinner is not an invitation to sex.
- I agree.

147
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:48,654
We ate, we went to the parking lot
to get our cars. We started kissing.

148
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,086
Next thing, we were back at my place naked.

149
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,221
- The sex was consensual?
- Yes!

150
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,094
Two or three nights later,
we sleep together again.

151
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:01,463
She assumed that the relationship
was a lot farther along than I did.

152
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,263
I told her I wanted it to stop.

153
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,567
She got pissed, threatening.
That's what the inmates saw.

154
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,539
Then you had her fired.

155
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,401
She was fired
because she was incompetent...

156
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,469
not because
I didn't want to fuck her anymore!

157
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,174
Mr. Strauch...

158
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:25,017
inform Officer Howell
that the state will settle this out of court.

159
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,393
She can return to work as soon as she likes.

160
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:41,035
You say one word to me and I'll scream.

161
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,779
I must go. I have a visitor.

162
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,519
It's my sister.

163
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:12,802
Goodson...

164
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,377
I asked to see you because I received
a rather troubling visit from a young woman.

165
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,078
- Tricia Ross.
- Yes.

166
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,145
Then you do know her?

167
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,715
Yes, she's a plaintiff in the lawsuit
we're bringing against the state.

168
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:32,152
- Her brother was murdered during the riot.
- I see.

169
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,117
Why did she come to see you?

170
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:39,494
She said she's been trying to reach you,
that you've been ignoring her.

171
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,760
- Yes, I have.
- Why?

172
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,372
Thought so.

173
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,503
She's in love with you.
And you're in love with her.

174
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,341
We've only seen each other twice.

175
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,608
Since when does it take more than that?

176
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:00,118
Goodson, when you turned your back
on our faith, became a Muslim...

177
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:02,086
I took it very personally.

178
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,749
Like you had
somehow rejected me and Daddy.

179
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:06,985
I know you did, but it wasn't about that.

180
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,527
The worst thing you've ever done
was before that...

181
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,790
when you were gonna marry
Marilyn Crenshaw.

182
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:15,129
I could never understand
how you fell in love with that woman.

183
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,533
Why don't you say what you mean?

184
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:21,268
- That white woman!
- Yes!

185
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:25,038
That white woman. And here you go again.

186
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,238
For all your talk, for all your fervor...

187
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:30,771
there's still a part of you
that wants to be something you are not.

188
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,785
How many people will you hurt
before you accept the fact...

189
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,684
that you are exactly what you are!

190
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:39,782
And what is that?
I am Black, I am a Muslim, and I am a man.

191
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:43,556
And sometimes those three things,
they war with each other.

192
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:47,861
I'm not proud of my feelings for Tricia Ross,
but I am not ashamed of them either.

193
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:52,764
Because, sweet, sweet sister,
when I stop my feelings...

194
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,336
when I shut down my emotions,
then this prison...

195
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,538
it has truly won.

196
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,016
Yo, Said, man.

197
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:19,855
That thing you did with the hunger strike,
how you beat the hacks at their own game...

198
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,024
Yeah.

199
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,265
Man, I know I let you down.

200
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,500
I know you worked hard
to get me published, to get me free.

201
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:29,666
And I fucked up.

202
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:33,573
But I'm saying, man,
I ain't even been writing...

203
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:38,142
because I wanted to punish myself
but I miss it, minister.

204
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,747
Without poetry, man, I'm half of myself.

205
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:47,451
You're asking my permission to write?

206
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,729
Then write, my brother.

207
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,596
You know what? I will.

208
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:00,070
And the very first poem that I write
is gonna be dedicated to you...

209
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,004
and how you inspire all of us.

210
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,871
No, don't write that.

211
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,702
If you're gonna write, you write for yourself.

212
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,543
For your own soul, not because of me.

213
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:16,987
I'm no better than you, you know.

214
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,483
I'm just a punk like all the rest.

215
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,631
I was glad you called...

216
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:05,060
Let's not talk.

217
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,073
I am done with talking.

218
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:39,465
So, you've confessed
to breaking Beecher's arms and legs.

219
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,507
I broke his arms. Schillinger broke his legs.

220
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,633
Oh, yeah, that's right.

221
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,202
Then you feel less guilty, right?
'Cause you only broke his arms.

222
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,938
- Nun first or shrink first?
- Shrink.

223
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,248
What made you want to crawl inside
other people's heads?

224
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,151
I thought I could help them.

225
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:05,159
- And you do.
- Sometimes.

226
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:10,262
Sometimes I can get a fellow to see life
from a slightly different angle...

227
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:14,363
and then maybe he can cope a little better.

228
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,271
Slightly? A little?

229
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,807
You measure everything
in all these small steps.

230
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:27,544
Well, you have to.
There's rarely any dramatic breakthroughs.

231
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,522
Everything is stops and starts
and stutter steps.

232
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:35,053
And that frustrates you? It hurts you.

233
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,151
Hurts me?

234
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:40,528
No, I was trained
not to take any of that personally.

235
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,692
- That's a tough lesson to learn.
- Yeah.

236
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:44,167
- Especially here.
- Yeah.

237
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:48,195
I mean, it's not your fault
that your patients don't get better.

238
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:52,534
Still, you worry. You wonder...

239
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,312
if you're just not good enough.

240
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:06,251
Time's up. Visiting hours.
One of my ex-wives is coming to visit me.

241
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:12,762
- Goddamn! Did you see Keller's ex?
- What?

242
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:43,694
Pete, I heard Leo agreed to let Alvarez
participate in the victim-offender program?

243
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,356
Yeah. I'm on my way
to talk to Alvarez right now.

244
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,093
Great. I'll come along.

245
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,693
Ray, I don't think that would be a good idea.

246
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,429
I know you were there for Alvarez
since he came to Oz...

247
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:59,774
but in order for this to work,
I need to establish a rapport with him.

248
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,810
You know, separate from you.

249
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:06,142
- Well, I want to be involved.
- Yeah, I know you do. But you can't.

250
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,548
From now on
this is between Alvarez and Rivera and me.

251
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:31,065
Miguel, I want to talk to you
about Officer Rivera.

252
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:35,977
Would you be willing to meet with him
face to face?

253
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:38,144
- With Rivera?
- Yeah.

254
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:39,912
- Me?
- Yeah.

255
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,282
For what?

256
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:45,684
Well, so he can ask questions,
express his feelings...

257
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:49,160
and to give you the opportunity...

258
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,958
to take responsibility for blinding him.

259
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:56,296
What do you call this?
I take responsibility every fucking day.

260
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,963
No. Miguel, this is not remorse.

261
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,007
This is only punishment.

262
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,040
Rivera wants to see me?

263
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:09,706
I can't speak to him
until I know you're willing to cooperate.

264
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,748
Will you?

265
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,851
- Yeah.
- That's great. Good.

266
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,230
The warden has agreed
to release you from solitary...

267
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,765
while you're participating in the program.

268
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,360
What's the deal? I know
Glynn's not gonna let me out for free.

269
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,070
What does he want?

270
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,869
At some point you're gonna have to tell him
who raped his daughter, Ardith.

271
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,171
Or what?

272
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:43,614
Or you come back here.

273
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,179
It's up to you.

274
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,431
This isn't a way out.

275
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:08,899
It's a way in. Understand?

276
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:33,463
Hello, is Eugene there? Tina, hi.

277
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:37,327
This is Sister Peter Marie Reimondo
calling from Oswald.

278
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:43,172
<i>I was wondering... Could I come over there</i>
<i>to see you and Eugene?</i>

279
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:46,134
<i>Or you could come here, if you like.</i>

280
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:50,847
Shit. Am I seeing things, or is that Alvarez?
What's up, Miguelito?

281
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,316
You look really well rested, man.

282
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:57,816
You want us to forgive Alvarez?

283
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,450
There is no expectation of forgiveness.

284
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:04,053
Come on, Sister. We're Catholic, too.
We know what you're after.

285
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,155
I'm not here as a nun,
not even as a psychologist.

286
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:11,862
I'm here simply to encourage discussion,
to listen, to help clarify your feelings.

287
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:15,930
"Clarify"? What the fuck does that mean?
Clarify what?

288
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,999
- Tina!
- No, Eugene.

289
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:23,205
What do you need to clarify to that
piece of shit? He gouged your eyes out.

290
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,772
Blind forever.

291
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:29,585
Forget solitary. Alvarez should be
on death row, end of story.

292
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,795
Why do you want to go through
with this crap?

293
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:41,094
Baby, you don't have to be here, but I do.

294
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:45,196
And I need you to understand that.

295
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:53,170
Who says Alvarez is gonna give Eugene
what he wants?

296
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:55,712
If I sense a dead end, it's over.

297
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:59,012
And either party can call it quits at any time.

298
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:02,542
You know what I want?
To look at him in the eye...

299
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:06,623
just for a second, to have him see me...

300
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,192
what he did, and to find out why.

301
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,326
Why?

302
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:25,404
Why? That's what Pharaoh's asking himself.

303
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,836
Why is there blood in the Nile?

304
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:33,681
He asks his priests and his soothsayers,
but before they can figure it out...

305
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,653
swarms of frogs hop out of the water
and into the Egyptians' homes.

306
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,782
Into their beds and bathtubs
and mixing bowls.

307
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:44,360
Pharaoh says, "Enough, the Israelites
can get the fuck out."

308
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,624
"Yippee!" says Moses.

309
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:50,099
And then,
God hardens Pharaoh's heart again.

310
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:53,929
At the last minute,
Pharaoh decides the Israelites can't leave.

311
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:57,635
Suddenly, the dust of Egypt
turns to gnats and flies.

312
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:02,544
Imagine: Your house, your office,
your whole city filled with flies.

313
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:05,479
Imagine the noise,
all the buzzing in your head...

314
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:08,543
and bug spray won't be invented
for 4,000 years yet.

315
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,828
Get the fuck out of here, man.

316
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:22,124
What, man, somebody cut off your tongue
like your old man?

317
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:24,765
What's up, Miguel?

318
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:28,273
Suddenly you're back in Em City,
and you ain't got nothing to say?

319
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,037
I did what you asked me.
You ain't got nothing to say to me?

320
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,237
You wanna talk, we can talk.

321
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:37,312
You can start by telling me
what you're doing out of solitary.

322
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:38,679
You suck the warden's dick...

323
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:45,213
Reimondo's got me on some new program.

324
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,690
Bullshit. You gave us up.

325
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:49,583
I gave you up.

326
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,524
Blood in, blood out, Alvarez.
You made a pledge.

327
00:25:56,902 --> 00:26:00,338
I'm in, El Cid. I'm in.

328
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:04,768
Good.

329
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:08,169
Listen, man, Carlo Ricardo,
he was boxing for us.

330
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,238
He fucked up, he's in the hole.

331
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:13,042
- I hear you used to box.
- Yeah.

332
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,243
All you gotta do is beat some fag.

333
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,983
They got me on some of these drugs
to stop me from going crazy.

334
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:21,958
Crazy is good, bro. Crazy wins fights.

335
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,995
Stop taking that shit, man.
It's no good for you.

336
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,772
Cyril, let's go.

337
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:21,082
Come on. Get up.

338
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:26,751
First we gotta go work the kitchen,
then we gotta go box.

339
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,127
I don't wanna box today.

340
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,558
Relax, Cyril, your next fight's
not for two weeks.

341
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,835
I don't wanna box anymore.

342
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:42,897
Cyril, I'm getting sick and tired
of your fucking whining.

343
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:44,943
Get your ass out of bed.

344
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,649
O'Reily, your brother looked good
in the ring the other day.

345
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,883
What can I say? He gives good hooks.
Alvarez, you got your first fight today?

346
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,651
Yeah, I fight Jason Cramer.

347
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:01,989
The faggot? My money's on you, cuz.

348
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,996
Speaking of money, you bet me
that Cyril would lose to Robson, so pay up.

349
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,064
I still can't figure out what happened.

350
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:13,070
Robson lost, period.
Cyril won, exclamation point.

351
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,796
There's no way Robson got beat fair.

352
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,172
You accusing me of cheating, Guerra?

353
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:21,779
You wanna back off, O'Reily?
Nobody's accusing nobody.

354
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,642
Better luck later.

355
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:50,371
Prisoner number 98C931, Jason Cramer.

356
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:54,143
Convicted September 6, '98.

357
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:58,975
Murder in the first degree, kidnapping,
assault with a dangerous instrument.

358
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:02,684
Life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.

359
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:13,923
- Hi, O'Reily.
- Hey, Cramer.

360
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,794
You all ready for your big fight?

361
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,363
- Feeling good.
- Looking good.

362
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:23,836
Of course, so is Miguel Alvarez.

363
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,712
I got to tell you, Jason,
you going in the ring against Alvarez...

364
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:31,541
- you got balls.
- I didn't think you noticed.

365
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,080
Of course you're going to need them.

366
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:35,551
What do you mean?

367
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:40,187
I overheard Hernandez
talking to the other spics.

368
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:44,024
They say if you lose,
they're going to gang bang Anthony.

369
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:46,064
- My Anthony?
- That's what they said.

370
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:48,497
They'd better not put their paws
on my Anthony.

371
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,058
Odds are 50-to-1 in Miguel's favor.

372
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:52,361
Oh, sure.

373
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:55,873
Nobody thinks a fag can defend himself.
Let me tell you something.

374
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:59,900
There's only two things I know how to do:
Fight and suck.

375
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,605
Next!

376
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,780
Nice roll, O'Reily. You know the rule.
All betting goes through me.

377
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:11,149
Yeah, sure.

378
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,989
You ain't by any chance
doing some side action?

379
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:17,324
No, this is just some extra green
I've been saving up, you know.

380
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:21,354
As a sign of good faith,
maybe you ought to give me a little slice.

381
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,865
- How little?
- 25%.

382
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:35,640
- You got Alvarez for the fight today, right?
- I'm betting on the faggot.

383
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:38,482
That's crazy.

384
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:41,082
That's me.

385
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,600
- You got it?
- I got it.

386
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,431
Cool, let me see it.

387
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:01,795
I know it's none of my business,
but this is the second time...

388
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:04,842
you've asked me to take chloral hydrate
from the hospital ward.

389
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,073
- What are you doing with this stuff?
- You're right.

390
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,239
It's none of your business.

391
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,383
Get up!

392
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,457
Three, four...

393
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:07,833
five, six, seven. Come to me.

394
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:20,276
- Go fight. Fight!
- All right. Come on!

395
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,521
Five.

396
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:28,549
What's wrong with you?

397
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,386
You're getting your ass kicked
by a fucking faggot. Now come on, man.

398
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:39,027
Come on, man.
You're getting your ass kicked.

399
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:15,690
Yes!

400
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:43,789
<i>Darkness.</i>

401
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:48,021
For three days straight, only darkness.
Think of it.

402
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:51,993
Sitting in your house for three days.
No lights, no TVs...

403
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,300
not even the flashlight
you keep for blackouts.

404
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,732
Pharaoh, just sitting there on his throne,
in the dark...

405
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,344
wondering when it's all going to end.

406
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:04,448
All because of God.
Doesn't make sense, does it?

407
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:08,111
Pharaoh taking the blame
for what God was going to do anyway.

408
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:10,477
Fuck, yeah, it makes sense.

409
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:13,490
Pharaohs brought it on themselves
and their people.

410
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,584
Four hundred and thirty years,
the Israelites were slaves...

411
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:18,686
one Pharaoh after another.

412
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:21,726
No one gets away with that...

413
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:23,356
dead or alive.

414
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:27,268
Fuck me, girl!

415
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,802
Oh, man!

416
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,842
Nooter and Pecky are funny.

417
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:37,439
Who?

418
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,316
The puppets.

419
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:42,983
Oh, yeah, the puppets.

420
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:47,286
I had a dream last night
that I came between Miss Sally's breasts.

421
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:52,093
You shouldn't talk like that
about Miss Sally. She's a goddess.

422
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,131
Goddess? She a ho.

423
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,265
What the fuck is this?

424
00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:00,793
Not the fucking God squad again!
Sit the fuck down!

425
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,603
We know why you watch this show.

426
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:04,972
Sit down, man!

427
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,876
- It's not for its educational value.
- Shut the fuck up!

428
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,176
- But out of lust.
- Man, get away.

429
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:13,581
- Sermon's over, Cudney. Move away.
- No.

430
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,116
Lockdown!

431
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,426
Hey, champ.

432
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:33,869
Don't distract me.
I'm beating the shit out of Kareem Said.

433
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:40,209
Jason Cramer beat Miguel Alvarez.

434
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:46,611
Tim, how's Officer Hughes making out?

435
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:48,981
- You want the truth?
- Yeah.

436
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,950
He's just hanging on.

437
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:55,250
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, Leo.

438
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,994
I just don't think he has what it takes.

439
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,261
- Why?
- I was just curious.

440
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:07,634
You asked me to bring him into Em City.
That's a lot more than curious.

441
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:10,401
Clayton's dad and I were COs back when.

442
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,969
We were like brothers,
looking out for each other...

443
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:16,172
scheduling our shifts together.

444
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,107
Sam died 17 years ago.

445
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,447
- Killed in Oz.
- No shit.

446
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:26,483
Clayton is his only son.

447
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,961
Yo, Alvarez, great fight, man.

448
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,501
What're you talking about? I fucking lost.

449
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:41,196
Yeah, but I won.

450
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:45,932
How come everybody you bet on wins?

451
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,001
What can I say? I got a gift.

452
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,480
Miguel, how's it feel
to get your ass whooped by a faggot?

453
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,674
You better watch your fucking mouth.

454
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,345
What'll you do,
hit me with your purse, motherfucker?

455
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,321
That's enough, you two!

456
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:00,619
You made us look bad, Alvarez.

457
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:04,156
You made us look like
a bunch of <i>mariconas</i>.

458
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:05,490
Fuck you!

459
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,029
Get off him!

460
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,960
He zapped him with a stun gun!

461
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:15,201
How did a goddamn stun gun
make it through security?

462
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,901
Probably the same way
the drugs get through.

463
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:21,207
- I'll find out who had his eyes closed.
- Wait a minute.

464
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:24,146
What about Hughes?
The guy who used the stun gun?

465
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,446
He's tangled with the Latinos,
he smuggles in an illegal weapon...

466
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:31,079
he zaps Hernandez for a minor infraction.
The guy's out of control.

467
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,749
- You don't know what it's like being a CO.
- Come on.

468
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:35,656
You never have and you never will.

469
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:38,218
Look, Hughes fucked up
and I will deal with it.

470
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,695
Case closed.

471
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:44,495
Come in.

472
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,472
- Leo, I'm sorry I...
- Come here.

473
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,100
Get over here.

474
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:59,072
- Look at that.
- What?

475
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,377
Closer.

476
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:06,150
- Fuck!
- That's how fast it was for your father to die.

477
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:09,224
You think you're invincible?
Making your own set of rules?

478
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:12,729
- I needed an extra advantage to get respect.
- Respect?

479
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:16,161
I said I'm sorry! It won't happen again.

480
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,394
No, it won't happen again.

481
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,736
Are you going to fire me?

482
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:25,275
I'm transferring you
to the library. Permanently.

483
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:27,140
The library? Leo, I can't work...

484
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:31,341
Go! I got work to do,
like explain this wrist slap to my staff.

485
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:02,203
Morning.

486
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,805
Getting ready to go to the city
for your appeal?

487
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,446
I don't know. Woke up today...

488
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:11,512
got a good feeling.

489
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:15,515
Well, I hope the judge
overturns your verdict.

490
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,296
Of course, if he does,
I'll never see you again.

491
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,228
I'll miss you, Richie.

492
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:27,162
Yeah, but if they don't overturn the verdict...

493
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:33,474
I decided I'm going to do
what you suggested.

494
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:37,981
I'm going to tell the cops that Schillinger
and I killed Alexander Vogel together.

495
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,586
At least if I have to die, he'll die, too.

496
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,687
Get some justice.

497
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,052
Good boy.

498
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:51,727
I'm almost done with your sweater.

499
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:55,055
Okay, let's go.

500
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,637
Au revoir, Shirley.

501
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:08,569
No.

502
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,044
Goodbye, my darling.

503
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,422
"Thieves' law."

504
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:25,095
We would dress up as police officers...

505
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:27,924
and rob the homes of wealthy Russians.

506
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,258
But I got caught, sent to Tulun.

507
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:36,166
But fortunately I was able to bribe
a magistrate and was released early...

508
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:39,475
so I came to America to find a better life.

509
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:42,878
How did the INS let you in
with a criminal record?

510
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,341
They didn't. I lied on the application.

511
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:49,109
But the Ministry of Internal Affairs
in Moscow...

512
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,520
informed the FBI. Followed me, wiretaps.

513
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:55,358
So here I am.

514
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:59,190
Big news, boys. Richie Hanlon's
murder conviction got overturned.

515
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:02,556
Some loophole in the law.
He squeezed through.

516
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:05,459
Hanlon killed Alexander Vogel.

517
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:07,766
Yeah, you said you knew Vogel.

518
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,331
He was my enemy.

519
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:12,566
They're setting Hanlon free?

520
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:16,101
No, he's still got to serve time
for the original drug arrest.

521
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,648
You think they'll bring Hanlon
back to Em City?

522
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:20,684
He's on his way back now.

523
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,820
Well, this is cause to celebrate.

524
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:28,024
I have in my cell some vodka.

525
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,492
You do? Wow, real Russian vodka?

526
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,487
How did you get it in?

527
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,640
"When life is good,
it's better not to question why."

528
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:03,618
Jesus, I never thought I'd be thrilled
coming back to Em City.

529
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,758
Man, I feel great.

530
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:11,259
You know, you sit up there on death row,
counting down the days...

531
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:15,394
knowing all you got in your future
is the sharp end of a lethal needle.

532
00:43:15,673 --> 00:43:19,905
I'm telling you, my heart is pumping so fast
I think it'll explode out of my chest.

533
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:22,411
I am so fucking happy to be alive.

534
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,985
I'm sorry, am I talking too much?

535
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:35,584
What?

536
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:43,623
It's been a while since I did this.

537
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,540
I lied.

538
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:59,111
Alexander Vogel was my friend.

539
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:12,791
The last plague is the worst one.

540
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,263
That's the one that messes up
our ideas about a loving God.

541
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,199
All the firstborn in the land of Egypt killed
on one night when everyone's asleep.

542
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:25,909
You the oldest child in the family?
Would have been you. No questions asked.

543
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,478
Pharaoh's son dies, too.

544
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:31,713
His heir...

545
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:35,775
his pride and joy...

546
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,519
his sweet...

547
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:40,317
innocent little boy.

548
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,293
<i>Lights out, Shirley.</i>

549
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:00,737
You're HIV positive.

550
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:03,712
- That is not possible.
- I'll schedule you for counseling.

551
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:06,249
- And make arrangements for your transfer...
- Transfer?

552
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:09,912
All inmates who test positive for HIV
are to be isolated in one place.

553
00:45:09,987 --> 00:45:11,386
This isn't happening to me.

554
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:18,320
Can I offer you something to drink,
Father? Cappuccino?

555
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:20,089
You have a cappuccino machine?

556
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:23,190
I'm trying to make
the best of a worst-case situation.

557
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:25,627
The only upside to being in this unit...

558
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:30,140
is the hacks think we're already dead,
so they pretty much let us do as we please.

559
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,004
I'll have a cappuccino, sure.

560
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:33,407
Okay, sit.

561
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,776
You know, Father, I've always considered
you nothing but a hack in black.

562
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:44,685
I know that a lot of inmates don't trust me,
but I'm trying to demonstrate...

563
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,985
that I'm more than just a stoolie
for the warden.

564
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:48,753
For me it goes deeper than that.

565
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:52,990
In my neighborhood, growing up,
a boy became one of four things:

566
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:57,160
A doctor, a lawyer, a priest,
or a businessman.

567
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,236
I understand.

568
00:46:00,304 --> 00:46:04,400
And in order to become a businessman,
you had to burn a saint.

569
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:07,372
- You know about burning a saint?
- Yeah.

570
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:12,314
That's when you burn a picture of a saint
to renounce your obligation to the church...

571
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:16,183
in order to prove your loyalty
to the other businessmen.

572
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:18,048
- Right.
- Thank you.

573
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:31,300
I thought it was a mistake,
the test saying I was HIV positive...

574
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:34,667
so I had my own doctor check the results,
and it's true.

575
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,907
You know, being HIV today does not
necessarily mean a death sentence.

576
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,000
Many people live...

577
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:43,137
I've heard all the speeches,
so save your breath.

578
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:45,580
In my business, you're always ready to die...

579
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:49,016
ready for the quick shot
in the back of the head, but...

580
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,449
it's the slow dying that's different.

581
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,884
It gives you time to think.

582
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:59,028
Time to reflect on your life.

583
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:03,459
I want to make a confession.

584
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:07,999
A confession?

585
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:11,974
I want to confess to everything
I've done in the course of my life.

586
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:14,611
Everything...

587
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:17,980
and make a good act of contrition.

588
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,415
All right.

589
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:32,560
It's been a while. Can you get me started?

590
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:35,723
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned...

591
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,994
Right, it's like riding a bicycle.

592
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:40,727
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

593
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:43,969
My last confession was...

594
00:47:49,113 --> 00:47:51,206
Boss, you have two seconds?

595
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:53,907
Yeah, sit down.

596
00:47:56,687 --> 00:48:00,453
Years ago, Nino Schibetta taught me
how to play this game.

597
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:02,189
Pinocchio.

598
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,090
Pinocchio. It's pinochle, you dumb fuck.

599
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:10,031
We were good friends. Good buddies.

600
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:14,469
He said I was more Italian
than any nigger in this place.

601
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:17,267
Adebisi, you want to
waltz down memory lane?

602
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,643
Go dance somewhere else.

603
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,804
You and I could be partners.

604
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,641
- I already got a partner. Wangler.
- But you hate Wangler.

605
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,147
I hate you, too, so what does that mean?

606
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,916
I still remember
when you split my head open.

607
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,957
You were trying to kill me...

608
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:36,318
because I was a strong enemy.

609
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:38,985
I could be a strong ally.

610
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:47,193
I'm listening.

611
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,362
If something were to happen to Wangler...

612
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,338
we could be partners.

613
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:56,501
Sure.

614
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:00,305
Good.

615
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:15,526
Did you see that? We got to whack Adebisi.

616
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:19,202
- Nappa said to chill on that.
- Fuck Nappa. Nappa's gone.

617
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:21,902
Yeah. Word.

618
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:30,504
I know you're having trouble
with Wangler and his crew.

619
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,573
- Yeah, those bitches.
- You want to let the man talk?

620
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:37,382
This is simple.
You help me get rid of the niggers...

621
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:40,616
- we take over the drug trade.
- Simple.

622
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:43,052
What about the white guys?

623
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:47,120
They don't care who they work with
as long as the job gets done.

624
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:51,631
You're asking us to help you
get rid of your people?

625
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,269
They are not my people.

626
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:57,899
I am an African.

627
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:03,671
Okay.

628
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,105
Deal.

629
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:10,516
Gentlemen, this room here
is the computer room.

630
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:14,122
Call me crazy, but I think
when I see people in this room...

631
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:17,649
they should be using computers.
But you three aren't...

632
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:22,462
which leads me to guess,
'cause I'm such a bright fellow...

633
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:26,299
that you're here for a different reason.
Forgive me for being distrustful...

634
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,463
that probably means you're up to no good.

635
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:32,168
That's right, come on, take a hike.
Let's go. You, too, Simon.

636
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:34,511
I am using the computer.

637
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:39,476
Can I give you one little small suggestion?

638
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:41,449
Turn it on.

639
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:49,887
<i>You reap what you sow.</i>

640
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:52,195
<i>Pharaoh got what he deserved.</i>

641
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:56,657
<i>But what about Abdul the farmer</i>
<i>who woke up with frogs on his face...</i>

642
00:50:56,734 --> 00:51:00,363
<i>his cattle dead from anthrax,</i>
<i>his wife fucked up with lesions...</i>

643
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:04,669
<i>his only child dead, all because of</i>
<i>a leader he didn't even get to vote for?</i>

644
00:51:04,742 --> 00:51:07,677
<i>What about all the people</i>
<i>who reap what they don't sow?</i>

645
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:12,546
<i>Babies born addicted to crack,</i>
<i>4- year-olds molested, ethnic cleansing?</i>

646
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:14,340
<i>What about you?</i>

647
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:17,914
<i>Is there a law in the universe or something...</i>

648
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:20,286
<i>a law about needless suffering?</i>

649
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,925
<i>A law that even God can't break?</i>

650
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:48,515
That's it?

651
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:51,378
- You sure?
- Yeah.

652
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:56,392
- Check again.
- That's all there is. Get the fuck out of here.

653
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,063
What did you get?

654
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:07,000
Birthday card from my mom.

655
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,834
- It's your birthday?
- Today.

656
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,108
How old are you, nigger?

657
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,009
Eighteen up in this motherfucker.

658
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:16,807
Eight-fucking-teen!

659
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:19,709
Guess that makes you a motherfucking man.

660
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:22,877
Get out of here. I've been a man
a long time. Don't play me out.

661
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:25,786
Son, let's go lick these titties like men.

662
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:29,121
That sounds cool to me. Bricks, you down?

663
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:32,757
I'll check you later.
I got to make a phone call.

664
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,129
- I'm going to catch up to y'all. Peace out.
- All right.

665
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:42,703
Laurie, how you doing?
Yeah? How's the baby?

666
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,869
That's good.

667
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:48,874
Didn't you forget something? My birthday.

668
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,211
It's okay.

669
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:56,509
But I wrote you asking for some boots
'cause these shits just kind of hurt.

670
00:52:57,588 --> 00:53:01,046
I know money's tight,
so just do whatever you got to do, okay?

671
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:04,350
All right, look, I got to go, okay?

672
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:08,825
I love you, too. All right, bye.

673
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:13,095
- Ma, have you seen Laurie?
- Not lately.

674
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:16,201
She brought the baby
around about three weeks ago.

675
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:18,434
Left him with me for the weekend.

676
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,167
- Where she been going?
- I don't know.

677
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:25,481
- You don't ask?
- I asked. She said to visit a sick friend.

678
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:29,751
Honey, I could tell by the way she said it,
there was no sick friend.

679
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:32,587
- You never liked her anyway.
- This is why.

680
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:36,524
She is a mother. She should be home
with her child, not off gallivanting.

681
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:38,618
Who she gallivanting with?

682
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:41,696
I've got my suspicions.

683
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:43,689
Like who, Ma?

684
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:47,166
Ronnie Smith.

685
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:50,701
What the fuck?
She knows I don't like that motherfucker!

686
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,744
- And I got other suspicions.
- Like?

687
00:53:57,748 --> 00:53:59,079
What, Ma?

688
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:02,547
I know that face. Don't hold back on me.

689
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:04,849
I think he's hurting the baby.

690
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:09,286
Little Jordan's got black-and-blue marks.
She said he fell.

691
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,419
Babies fall, but not that much.

692
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:20,833
Fuck! Fucking motherfucker!
You get my son!

693
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:25,370
I'm getting the fuck out of here,
and I'm getting that motherfucker!

694
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:26,704
I don't give a fuck!

695
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,703
I said it once before, and I'll say it again.

696
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:32,745
All women is bitches!

697
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:41,422
The nigger she's fucking
is hurting my son...

698
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:44,359
my seed, my prince. What the fuck?

699
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:47,286
Come on, what kind of shit is that?

700
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:51,627
What the fuck am I going to do in here?
How can I help him in here?

701
00:54:56,506 --> 00:55:00,875
You and me both,
we know people that can make this right.

702
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:03,570
I use my people...

703
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,844
there's no way
the cops will be able to trace it back to you.

704
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:14,682
Make the call. Any price, I don't give a fuck.

705
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:18,420
I want Ronnie Smith dead.
Dead, motherfucker.

706
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:28,866
Pierce...

707
00:55:31,308 --> 00:55:32,605
my wife, too.

708
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:03,964
Ma? Yeah, it's me. Look,
I want you to go over to Laurie's tonight...

709
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,306
and get the baby out of the house.
Never mind why.

710
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:11,336
Just go over there and get the baby
out the house tonight. You hear me?

711
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:14,475
Get him out the house, Ma. All right.

712
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,151
Moses finally got the chosen people
to the Promised Land.

713
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:26,595
Things didn't really get any better.

714
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:28,528
They were constantly at war...

715
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:31,761
with the Canaanites, the Hittites,
the Jebusites.

716
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:35,927
Eventually the Israelites were
completely crushed by the Romans.

717
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:39,768
The suffering continues,
which leads me to wonder...

718
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:43,272
is there too much suffering in the world?

719
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:45,712
Fuck the world. Here in Oz...

720
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:49,913
there's too much suffering
even for a guilty man to endure.

721
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:52,786
Bricks, you coming?

722
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:56,758
No, I'm going to catch up to y'all
in a minute, though.

723
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:10,468
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

724
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:14,637
<i>Happy motherfucking birthday to me</i>

725
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,541
<i>Happy birthday</i>

726
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:21,778
<i>To Kenny</i>

727
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:26,047
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
