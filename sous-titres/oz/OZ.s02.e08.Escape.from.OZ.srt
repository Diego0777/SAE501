1
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,798
Escape.

2
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:46,198
What a word. What a concept.

3
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:51,805
The dictionary says ''escape'' means
''to break loose, to bust free. ''

4
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,760
Yeah.

5
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,361
There are all kind of ways
to get the fuck out of Oz.

6
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:05,236
For example,
you can dig your way out.

7
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:09,164
Hurry up, l'll put the tiles back.

8
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:31,523
Okay, everybody, listen up.

9
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:32,676
As you probably know,

10
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,003
Officer Wittlesey has transferred
to Unit B.

11
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:38,445
Replacing her as Em City supervisor
is Karl Metzger.

12
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:39,801
Officer Metzger.

13
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,002
- Oh, no.
- This guy?

14
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,635
Some of you know me from ad seg.

15
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:46,799
My rep is that l'm tough, but l'm fair.

16
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:52,526
l won't take any shit from anybody,
but l don't intend to give any either.

17
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:54,643
All right, that's all.

18
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,638
Count.

19
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,476
lt's gotta be in here somewhere.

20
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,840
What's going on?

21
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,759
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

22
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,316
Hey, don't play games with me,
asshole. Where's the tunnel?

23
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,239
What tunnel?

24
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:22,125
- We been watching you.
- Leave him alone.

25
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,437
Here it is.

26
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,800
Holy shit.

27
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:36,915
How far along are you?

28
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,920
We figure by tomorrow, we're on
the other side of the prison wall.

29
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,203
When you go, we're going with you.

30
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:46,360
How? We're gonna leave at night.
You'll be locked into your own pod.

31
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,836
- Then we'll switch pods.
- What?

32
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:50,759
You two will switch pods with us.

33
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,758
Otherwise, we tell the hacks
about what's going on.

34
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,121
All right.

35
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,164
lf you can arrange the exchange,
the tunnel's yours.

36
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:59,399
- Rebadow.
- Shut up, Busmalis.

37
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,606
Yeah, shut up, bushman.

38
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:10,157
l can't let the Nazis go through Lizzie.
lt would be like they were raping her.

39
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,561
ln my years at Oz,
l've learned one rule:

40
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:16,560
Accept the hand you're dealt.
We'll lose the tunnel either way.

41
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:20,606
Better to let it go and start a new one
in the next pod.

42
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:26,840
Oh, fuck.

43
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:30,167
- Metzger?
- Yes?

44
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:33,796
l need an ask.

45
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:40,402
Hey, Tim.

46
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,238
l wanna move Rebadow and Busmalis
out of their pod.

47
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:47,956
- Fine.
- Don't you wanna know why?

48
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,799
l trust you.

49
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,364
- Take care of her.
- Fuck you.

50
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,682
Stupid fucks.

51
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,519
There they go.

52
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:33,560
- How can you be so calm?
- What would you have me do?

53
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,520
All right.

54
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:55,882
Let's go, pussy.

55
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,841
- They should almost be there.
- Yes.

56
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:03,316
We should have told them.

57
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,602
- No.
- Yes.

58
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,282
We should've warned them that
we weakened all the support beams.

59
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:14,442
We should've warned them that
the tunnel will collapse on top of them.

60
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,803
Oh, shit.

61
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,678
Oh, shit.

62
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,718
- You all right?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:48,124
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Prisoner number 96M542.

64
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:51,643
Mark Mack.
Convicted June 1 st, '96.

65
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:55,482
Murder in the second degree,
vandalism, hate crimes.

66
00:06:55,647 --> 00:07:00,926
Sentence: 70 years.
Up for parole in 40.

67
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,965
Yo, back up. Back up, man.
Back up.

68
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,561
Back up, it's falling down.
lt's collapsing, man.

69
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,481
Shit, man, back up. Go, man, go.

70
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:26,483
l've been here five minutes,
l got two bodies on my floor.

71
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,480
This is not the way
shit's gonna happen with me here.

72
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,320
We find one more hole,
who's going in it?

73
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,284
l'm putting one of you
goddamn cocksuckers

74
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,039
in the next fucking hole we find.

75
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,643
Who wants a shovel?
Dig me the goddamn hole.

76
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,002
You gonna dig me a hole?
Go ahead.

77
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,283
Goddamn it.

78
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,041
The tunnel was found
in what used to be your pod.

79
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,516
Yes, he dug it.

80
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:54,997
- Rebadow.
- Under orders from Mark Mack.

81
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,725
Mack forced you to dig?

82
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,845
He threatened to kill Busmalis,
didn't he?

83
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,645
Yes. The Nazi bastard.

84
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:07,561
lf that's true,
you should've come to us.

85
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:11,720
That's easy to say.
The poor man was terrified.

86
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:12,922
Terrified.

87
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:17,799
Busmalis warned him of the dangers,
but they were so anxious to go.

88
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,800
They wouldn't listen to a word.

89
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,437
Even so,
these two should be punished.

90
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, neither one
is much of a discipline problem.

91
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:30,725
You can go.

92
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,325
Poet, what's up?

93
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:16,962
lt's my new work assignment,

94
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,163
here in the morgue.

95
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:23,675
McManus' revenge on me
for screwing up outside, man.

96
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,917
Yeah, what happened, man?
You was free.

97
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,920
Yeah, and still a fiend.

98
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,524
l spent all the money
l got for that book on crack.

99
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:34,836
And when the cash ran out,

100
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,077
them fucking dealers
came after me, man.

101
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,159
l was defending myself.

102
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:42,845
You shot a guy six times.

103
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,444
l had to make sure
the nigga was dead.

104
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:46,722
True that.

105
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,321
So, what do we do here?

106
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,603
You know, wait for the mortician
to get back from lunch.

107
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,485
Undertaker school in town
sends a student up

108
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,763
to work on our corpses
for the practise.

109
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:57,876
And we help them out?

110
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:02,359
Yeah, you know, hand them shit.
Embalming fluid, cosmetics.

111
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:03,960
Cosmetics?

112
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:06,038
You mean like lipstick and shit?

113
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,846
Sure, you gotta look pretty
before they plant you.

114
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,084
Shit, l ain't no girl.

115
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,636
They ain't putting
none of that shit on my face, yo.

116
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,685
When you're dead,
you don't have much of a choice.

117
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:21,645
Death is a lot like life in Oz, man.

118
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,520
- lt'll work. l'm telling you, it'll work.
- Yo, Po.

119
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
- What you talking about? What'll work?
- Yo, check this out.

120
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:32,046
Money got a plan
to escape out of Oz, yo.

121
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,437
What's up? What's up?

122
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:37,557
- Yo, we working stiff patrol, right?
- Right.

123
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:40,685
So just now, we loaded those
two Aryan fucks into boxes, right,

124
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,917
which get sent to funeral home
for burial.

125
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:46,284
So my idea is,
next time somebody dies,

126
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,597
l get in the box instead.

127
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,519
Hill, coffins are airtight.

128
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,757
- You'd die of asphyxiation.
- Thank you.

129
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,646
Not if l drill some subtle little holes
in the right places.

130
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,957
But the casket's gonna be sealed.
You'll be trapped inside.

131
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,595
Not if l get a couple of friends of mine
to come to the funeral home

132
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,756
and break me out.

133
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,487
Yeah, but what you gonna do
with the real motherfuckers that died?

134
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,080
How hard is it to hide
a couple of bodies up in Oz, son?

135
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,317
Temporarily, at least.

136
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:13,123
- lt's a good plan.
- Shit might work.

137
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:14,356
That's what l'm saying.

138
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,757
That's better than having
a motherfucker mail you out.

139
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,997
- l wouldn't be telling everybody.
- l was bullshitting.

140
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,398
l know-- But l was bullshitting.
You thought l wanted to--?

141
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,565
Express mail, all right?

142
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:28,966
Every inmate wants out of prison,
by hook or by crook.

143
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,641
Of course, there are some who find
that once they're free,

144
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,401
life on the other side
ain't all it's cracked up to be.

145
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,839
l'm here to see Sister Peter Marie.

146
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
Robert Sippel's out front
asking for you.

147
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:53,204
So, Father,
meet any cute boys on the outside?

148
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,164
Any boys with the first name Dick?

149
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,402
You look exhausted.

150
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,286
Well, the last few days
have been very difficult.

151
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,725
Registering as a convicted pervert
was more difficult than l thought.

152
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,118
l had to go down to the courthouse
and stand in line with ordinary people

153
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,878
wanting fishing licences
and learner's permits.

154
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,276
l stepped up to the counter
and softly explained to the clerk

155
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:23,482
why l was there.

156
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:26,719
She boomed,
''Perverts fill out these.''

157
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,003
Oh, boy.

158
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:33,683
So how's the job search going?

159
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,315
Seek and ye shall find, right?

160
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,645
Hard enough getting employment
as an ex-con,

161
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:42,846
but once they discover
that l've fondled a young boy...

162
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,804
Well, have you found a place
to live?

163
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,083
After ten years of imprisonment,

164
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,842
my first two nights of freedom
were spent sleeping on the subway.

165
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:55,245
Well, you know
l'll do anything l can to help.

166
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,604
Well, that's why l'm here.

167
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,997
Would you please speak
with Warden Glynn?

168
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,522
About what?

169
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:05,076
Letting me sleep here in Oz.

170
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,442
You want me to let Robert Sippel
move into a cell?

171
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:10,519
Just until he finds a landlord
who will rent him a room.

172
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,359
l need to see the shift log.

173
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,358
He'll have to stay in Gen Pop.

174
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,087
- He'll be at risk.
- Yeah, he's aware of that.

175
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,124
He's not gonna get
an apartment unless he has a job.

176
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,402
Well, that's my next mission.

177
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,035
l gotta find somebody
who will hire a defrocked priest.

178
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,926
- l will.
- You?

179
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:28,839
Yeah, as my assistant.

180
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:32,124
l've got a discretionary fund
from the diocese.

181
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,518
Guess it's time
l used my discretion.

182
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,402
Well, there's not
much room here, but...

183
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:43,925
- l appreciate this, Father.
- Oh, yeah, well, l needed a...

184
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:45,884
As you can see,
l'm not very organized.

185
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,558
You're still uncomfortable
around me.

186
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,564
Chaplain's office.

187
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,605
Yes.

188
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:01,282
Okay. Okay, l'll tell him.

189
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,966
A patient in the hospital is dying.
He's asked for the anointing.

190
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:13,555
lf l'm really here to help you, Father,

191
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,955
then let me help you.

192
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:25,245
He pardons all your inequities,
he heals all your ills.

193
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,477
He redeems your life
from destruction.

194
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,559
He crowns you
with his kindness and compassion.

195
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,402
Father in heaven,
through this holy anointing,

196
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,876
grant Joseph comfort
in his suffering.

197
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:39,323
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

198
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,157
Mr. Hanssel?
Hi, l'm Father Mukada.

199
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,238
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Sure.

200
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,716
This past few weeks, there's been
plenty of stuff in the press.

201
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:53,277
What with the legislature passing that
law requiring sex offenders to register,

202
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,560
and with Father Sippel getting out.

203
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,197
lt stirred up a lot of things in me,
feelings l thought l'd put down.

204
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,366
l told him that you were coming.

205
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:05,560
ls he willing to talk with me?

206
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,160
Yes.

207
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,641
He feels that he owes you that much,
at least.

208
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,560
l've never been
in a prison before.

209
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:14,716
Don't worry.

210
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,242
There'll be a correctional officer
with you the whole time.

211
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,525
Yeah, to protect me or him?

212
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:27,405
l'm sorry, Father. Look, l have
no intention of harming the man.

213
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:31,276
l don't really know
what my intentions are except...

214
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,801
l haven't seen him since that day.

215
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,645
Ten years is a long time
to carry this shit inside.

216
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,638
Sorry to say ''shit''
in front of a priest.

217
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,916
Sometimes ''shit'' is the only word
that fits.

218
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,320
Yes?

219
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,646
- How do you live with yourself?
- How do you?

220
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:35,159
Whatever l've done,
l've done for righteous reasons.

221
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:40,916
Any laws l've broken
don't deserve to be laws.

222
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,076
But you...

223
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,885
You, you fucking baby raper.

224
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,077
- You should be dead.
- Back in your cage, Schillinger.

225
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,720
Don't make me use this.

226
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,276
You wouldn't want me to enjoy myself,
now, would you?

227
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,166
Way to go, Vern.

228
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:07,802
Thank you, officer.

229
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,117
l'm just doing my job, pal.

230
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:13,165
For once,
l agree with that Nazi fuck.

231
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,238
What do you need?

232
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:28,604
- Some rec time.
- With who?

233
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,679
Sippel.

234
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,957
No! No!

235
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:40,278
No! No!

236
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,285
- No!
- Keep moving.

237
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,480
No! No!

238
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,716
No!

239
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,520
No!

240
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,316
Don't be nervous.

241
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:33,638
- l'm not nervous.
- Well, you seem nervous.

242
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:35,202
Which l can understand,

243
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:38,677
you and me being locked
in this cell together.

244
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,246
Breathe.

245
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,962
You don't touch many women,
do you?

246
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,358
- Nope.
- l can tell.

247
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,640
You're twisting and turning my body
like l'm a man.

248
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,162
l'm treating you like a patient,
any patient.

249
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,557
That's right.

250
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,287
Doctors can't feel emotion
toward their caseload.

251
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,564
That's not true.
We're compassionate. Look up.

252
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,957
Yeah, compassion.

253
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,482
That marvellous thing
which allows you to be human

254
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,276
and still be above the rest of us.

255
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,836
You're fine. We're done.

256
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,115
Am l well enough to die?

257
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,357
Healthy enough to execute?

258
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:27,159
Look, if l'm nervous it's because
l don't understand how a woman,

259
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:29,079
a mother,
could do that to her own child.

260
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:33,081
- Her own flesh and blood.
- lt was an accident.

261
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,319
Officer.

262
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:40,279
The next time l see you, Shirley,

263
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:44,281
l'll be standing over a gurney about
to poke you with a lethal injection.

264
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,727
Thank you, darling.

265
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,124
What's the opposite of ''escape''?

266
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,437
l don't mean ''arriving. ''
l mean, being in a place

267
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,916
and getting sucked deeper
and deeper inside.

268
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,557
So far down that you almost
burst through to another side.

269
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,958
Please, more Quaaludes
from the hospital.

270
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,516
Hey, Hernandez,
get your feet off the table.

271
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,279
Do you hear me,
or do l gotta have to translate?

272
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,238
What's the problem?

273
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
Hernandez here,
he's got attitude.

274
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:13,565
Raoul,

275
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,124
l'm gonna ask you nicely, once.

276
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:19,923
Will you please take your feet
off the table?

277
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:22,920
Will you do that for me, huh?

278
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,760
Thank you. Let's go, Eugene.

279
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,683
Let's go, let's go.

280
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:52,762
Alvarez, Rivera's still got his eyes.

281
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:56,040
You gonna do the job, man?
Or are you a fag?

282
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,962
l'm just waiting for the right moment.

283
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:10,396
Will you shut the fuck up?
l'll take your fucking eyes.

284
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,877
- Come and try.
- Yo, drop it now, all right?

285
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:19,325
Today, white boy.
Do it today, Michael.

286
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,403
- l got tickets to the Knights game.
- Who they playing?

287
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:29,556
Chicago. Wanna go?

288
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,843
- l can't. l got a date.
- Ray?

289
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,396
l gotta go see Sippel
at Benchley Memorial.

290
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,717
At least now,
he's got a place to sleep, right?

291
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:37,922
Tim.

292
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,442
Leo, do you have any idea
who crucified Sippel?

293
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:44,156
- No, not yet.
- l bet a CO was involved.

294
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:48,440
What is that?

295
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,564
Oh, my God.

296
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,685
My eyes!

297
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:03,442
My eyes!

298
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,076
- l need a CO in here!
- Get some help!

299
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:22,685
Lockdown. Lockdown!

300
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,959
He's not in Emerald City.

301
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,721
Search the whole prison.
Search every fucking inch.

302
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,127
Lockdown. Lockdown.

303
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,363
Let's go, man.

304
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:08,966
- How's he doing?
- He's sedated,

305
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:10,560
but, Leo, his eyes are gone.

306
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,797
He's lost a lot of blood.
He's gonna need a transfusion.

307
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,400
- Then do it.
- He's AB negative.

308
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,966
l called the blood bank. They're out.

309
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,924
Then find somebody in Oz
with that blood type.

310
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,237
We're cross-checking
staff medical records right now

311
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:22,637
but it's gonna take some time.

312
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:25,684
Christ.

313
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,118
Shut up. You shut the fuck up.

314
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,561
Miguel.

315
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,845
Miguel.

316
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,206
All right.

317
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,957
SORT team's going through every unit
cell by cell.

318
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:47,845
- So far, no sign of Alvarez.
- Shit.

319
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:49,406
- Oh, God.
- What?

320
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:50,841
No one on the staff
was AB negative

321
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,679
so l started checking
the inmates' records.

322
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,405
l found a prisoner
with the same blood type.

323
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,285
- So let's get him down here.
- Who is it?

324
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,160
Ryan O'Reily.

325
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:02,803
- Fuck you.
- A man's life is in danger.

326
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,003
A hack's life. Fuck you.

327
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,840
Goddamn it, O'Reily.

328
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,158
l'm sick of your fucking bullshit.
Now, you need to do this now!

329
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:13,887
There's only one of two ways
you're gonna get my blood out of me.

330
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:15,719
You either tie me down
and you take it...

331
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:16,922
Or?

332
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:18,645
Or you let my brother Cyril
out of the hole

333
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:20,479
and you put him
in Em City with me.

334
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:24,965
Miguel, you gotta think this through.

335
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:28,563
- l'm trying, l'm trying.
- There's no way out.

336
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,365
Eventually, the SORT team
is gonna find us here

337
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,836
and then what you gonna do?
How are you gonna fight them off?

338
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:34,679
They got rifles.
You got shot during the riot.

339
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:35,996
You wanna get shot again?

340
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,886
lf they fucking catch me, they're gonna
fucking beat the shit out of me.

341
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:40,526
Miguel, l promise you,
l won't let them.

342
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:43,599
That's fucking bullshit, man.
What the fuck are you gonna do?

343
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,600
You gonna fucking hold up
a crucifix?

344
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,798
Lie down.

345
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,804
l remember stories
about my grandfather.

346
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:34,121
How he killed the guy
who cut out my father's tongue.

347
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:37,085
Ended up in solitary, right?

348
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,999
- You know what he was like.
- Yeah.

349
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:43,475
He spent 20 years,
20 years in solitary.

350
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:47,242
Then he goes fucking crazy
because of the Alzheimer's, right?

351
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,439
The thought of that, man,
the thought of that,

352
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:55,364
of spending the rest of my fucking life
in a little fucking room.

353
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:59,486
No-fucking-one around
except a few fucking hacks.

354
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,037
Fuck.

355
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,078
Fuck.

356
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:11,358
l tell you, man, l couldn't handle that.
l couldn't handle that.

357
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:14,236
No, no way.

358
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:19,565
l mean, l got a problem as it is
being in small places.

359
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,326
But to be in a little fucking room...

360
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,925
l'll fucking go bugs in a day.

361
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,519
No, no, no.

362
00:27:39,127 --> 00:27:42,881
They put me in solitary,
they might as well beat me to death.

363
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,480
Miguel.

364
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,645
We've been through a lot together,
you and me.

365
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,525
And you gotta believe me
when l tell you,

366
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,205
there's no alternative.

367
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,885
Yeah, there is.

368
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:05,642
You see that?

369
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:10,879
When l did that, l was fucking nuts.

370
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,517
See, l know that now.

371
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,646
You know
what l should've done instead?

372
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:20,838
l should've cut my fucking throat.

373
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:21,996
Miguel, no.

374
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:24,596
You don't know what you're
talking about. Just look at me.

375
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:28,157
- Say a prayer for me, Father.
- Miguel, please don't. Miguel.

376
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:29,555
Miguel, no!

377
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:33,725
- Get the fuck back.
- No!

378
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,843
- Don't hurt him. Don't hurt him.
- No!

379
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,520
- No, please stop.
- Don't hurt him.

380
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:40,326
No, don't hurt him.
l promised him you wouldn't.

381
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,239
- No!
- Don't.

382
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:45,558
No! No!

383
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:48,926
No. Fuck.

384
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:51,759
- Get him moving.
- Get the fuck off me.

385
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:55,044
- Get the fuck off me. Get off me.
- Get in there.

386
00:28:57,407 --> 00:29:01,082
Don't leave me here, please.

387
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,645
No.

388
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:14,319
Let me out. Let me out.

389
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,682
Let me out!

390
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:23,801
Help!

391
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,561
Somebody.

392
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,606
Let me out!

393
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,117
- End of lockdown.
- They must've found Alvarez.

394
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,800
Yeah.

395
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:39,080
They'll charge him,
attempted murder.

396
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:42,683
- Let his ass die in solitary.
- Yeah.

397
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,315
l feel bad, man, you know?

398
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:49,196
l was wrong about him, you know?
He did have balls.

399
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:07,916
Hey, Gloria, l have to talk to you.

400
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,246
What?

401
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,726
What would you possibly
have to say to me?

402
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:14,922
l'm sorry?

403
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:21,562
- How's Rivera?
- We'll know more in a few hours.

404
00:30:22,007 --> 00:30:25,283
All right,
Cyril's been moved to Em City.

405
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:30,079
McManus.

406
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:35,323
l fucked up a lot of people's lives.

407
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:36,966
Yeah.

408
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:42,639
My brother Cyril got slow
because of me.

409
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,277
We were at this funeral.

410
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:48,278
And there was this chick there
that l used to date.

411
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:02,203
She was there with her new boyfriend,
some wiseguy.

412
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,518
But she and me,
we were still hot for each other.

413
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,558
You fuck. Get off her.

414
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:27,766
Get the fuck out of here.

415
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:43,121
Cyril.

416
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:46,085
Cyril got brain-damaged
defending me.

417
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,963
When the doctors told me

418
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,482
that Cyril
would never be the same again,

419
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:53,285
that he would have the mind
of a 5-year-old--

420
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:54,641
Fuck.

421
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:56,604
--it crushed me.

422
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,644
So l got wasted.

423
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:00,406
l lost control.

424
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,398
Yes!

425
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,563
Everything l have done
since l've gotten here

426
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:17,118
was to protect my ass
so that l could make parole.

427
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,120
But...

428
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,316
What l feel for Gloria...

429
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:26,205
lt blinded me.

430
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,476
So l lost control again.

431
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,125
And now Cyril's in Oz

432
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,484
and he's gonna be here
for the next 60 years.

433
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:39,322
And he got raped by Schillinger

434
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,443
and he's afraid.

435
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,286
So...

436
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,115
l gotta stay here with Cyril.

437
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,482
l gotta protect my brother.

438
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:53,286
l mean, for once in my fucking life,

439
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,483
l'm gonna be his big brother.

440
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:58,445
You had Cyril kill Gloria's husband.

441
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:00,326
Yes.

442
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:03,516
You'll be brought up on charges.

443
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,839
lt's what l deserve.

444
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,163
Hey, fuck off.

445
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:32,204
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey.

446
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,116
Hey.

447
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:42,876
- Hey.
- How are you?

448
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:49,396
This morning
l cleaned out Preston's closet.

449
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:53,243
Boxed up his things
from his chest of drawers.

450
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:57,599
The man had seven
mismatched cuff links.

451
00:33:58,127 --> 00:33:59,162
Who saves one cuff link?

452
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:02,160
You lose one,
you throw the other one away.

453
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:05,400
Who even wears cuff links
these days?

454
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,762
Preston had style.

455
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,160
Yeah.

456
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:15,280
You hungry? You wanna
have dinner or something?

457
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:18,958
- No, thanks.
- Not like a date or anything.

458
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:21,806
No.

459
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,676
l gotta ask you something.

460
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,524
About O'Reily.

461
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,560
Do you think he really loves you?

462
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:41,360
Yeah.

463
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,517
No one will ever love me
as much as Ryan O'Reily.

464
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:52,597
And l have to live with that fact
every day for the rest of my life.

465
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:04,444
You can escape from Oz
in subtle ways.

466
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:07,485
Heroin, alcohol.

467
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,717
You shellac your brain
with chemicals

468
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:12,276
and it's almost as good
as being free.

469
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,039
Problem is, you do too many drugs

470
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:17,279
and you become a prisoner
of a different sort.

471
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:22,077
And it's even harder to escape
the emptiness that follows.

472
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,563
l love you.

473
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,122
l love you, Toby.

474
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,842
Chris, at last.

475
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,963
Give me a kiss.

476
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:57,245
- You're drunk.
- You bet your ass l am.

477
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,686
Did you miss me?

478
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:02,839
Christ, l missed you.
Come on, let's fuck.

479
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:05,926
l don't wanna fuck you, Beecher.

480
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,918
l don't wanna be
in the same room with you.

481
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:12,046
- Where you going? Chris.
- Hey, don't fucking touch me.

482
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:13,401
- Chris.
- Go away.

483
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:16,286
Are you mad at me
about something?

484
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:17,436
- Forget it.
- No, if--

485
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:18,801
l said, forget it.

486
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,923
No, if l did something, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to--

487
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,839
Why don't you keep
your voice down, huh?

488
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:24,520
Look.

489
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:27,320
l had a lot of time to think
in the hole.

490
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,557
One of the things l've decided
is you and me are through.

491
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:32,765
Jesus, what did l do?

492
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,565
Look, we'll talk about this
when you're sober.

493
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:37,082
Chris, what did l do?

494
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:40,356
Leave me alone.

495
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:45,362
lf it's the drinking, l can stop.
l can stop the drinking. l can.

496
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,721
Don't fucking touch me.

497
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,967
Hey, looks like a little quarrel there.

498
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:55,958
Chris.

499
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:57,956
Chris.

500
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:02,964
Lick your shoes for him.

501
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,718
Pussy.

502
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:01,479
So?

503
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:04,881
l've been out of the hole two days,

504
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:07,925
l haven't spoken
more than ten words to Beecher.

505
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,645
Yeah, l seen him.

506
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:12,116
He's a fucking mess.

507
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:15,996
- He's on the ledge.
- Yeah.

508
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:20,159
l say it's about time
we pushed him off.

509
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,005
You look like warmed-over shit,
Beecher.

510
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,442
lt's been a rough couple days.

511
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,357
Workout will do you good.

512
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,639
Hey, Beech.

513
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,361
No! You--

514
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,486
All right.

515
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:47,442
You fucking--

516
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:49,325
Behave.

517
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,000
- You and him?
- Say what?

518
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,237
Oh, yeah.
We've known each other a long time.

519
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:58,885
l've known Vern since
we were both doing time up in Lardner.

520
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,242
l was 1 7 and...

521
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:05,320
Well, he saved my life
from some big, dumb nigger

522
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:09,878
who wanted me to be his prag.
No, l don't think so.

523
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,876
l've owed him ever since.

524
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,683
l don't love you.

525
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:21,281
l've never loved you,
not for a second.

526
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:23,641
- Let him go.
- No, Chris.

527
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:25,525
No, let him go.

528
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:31,239
Let's see what you got there, Toby.
This time, for real.

529
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,166
My turn now.

530
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:15,764
Sieg heil, baby. Sieg-fucking-heil.

531
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,120
They broke both his arms
and his legs?

532
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:20,278
Hey, what's he do if he gets an itch?

533
00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:22,119
He looked like a fucking pretzel.

534
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,243
That's because
he was in love with Keller.

535
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:25,556
Love hurts.

536
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:28,958
- Schillinger did this.
- Fucking Schillinger did this, man.

537
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,846
- Yo, son, l wanna move in here.
- Why?

538
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,645
lt's a better view.

539
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,765
How'd this happen?
Who took Beecher to the gym?

540
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:40,476
l don't know, but l'll find out.

541
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:15,598
Hey, Leo, what do you know
about Karl Metzger?

542
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,405
l only know what's in the file. Why?

543
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:20,559
l don't know.
l just got a bad feeling about this guy.

544
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:35,197
Yeah, there are all kind of ways
to escape from Oz.

545
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:41,283
You can dig a tunnel, you can die,
or you can exit through your soul.

546
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:49,558
Nappa got a hold of our tits.
That bitch stole them from us.

547
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:53,878
- He got my tits.
- Yeah, look.

548
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:56,003
l don't know how,
but he got the package before we did.

549
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,725
And l don't know
how the fuck he found out,

550
00:41:57,887 --> 00:41:58,922
but we're fucked.

551
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,446
- Okay.
- We got to burn that wop, Adebisi.

552
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,280
- We will.
- When, man? Damn.

553
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:08,166
All you been doing is laying
in the bed these past couple of days.

554
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:09,999
And we've been covering for you
in the kitchen.

555
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:12,283
And frankly,
we getting tired of this shit.

556
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:18,518
Are you giving me orders, Kenny?

557
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,798
l know why you have come.

558
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:40,086
You are a fetisher.

559
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,238
You can see the future
in those shells.

560
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:45,126
They've already told me
we will meet.

561
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:52,882
Well, if you're so smart,

562
00:42:53,687 --> 00:42:55,200
what are you doing in prison?

563
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:31,803
Prisoner number 98J604,
Kipkemei Jara.

564
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,358
Convicted August 1 st, '98,
criminally negligent homicide.

565
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:39,041
Sentence: 20 years.

566
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:41,243
Up for parole in eight.

567
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:45,159
l believe l was sent here for you.

568
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:48,922
lf you don't change your ways,

569
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:52,921
stop the drugs, the violence,

570
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:54,520
you will die.

571
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:57,201
Everyone will die.
That's everybody's future.

572
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,756
How long have you been
in America?

573
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,599
Fifteen years.

574
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,485
You see?

575
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:05,524
You have lost the sense of:

576
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:11,000
- Home?
- Yes, home.

577
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:13,123
Where you come from.

578
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,642
You've been here for too long.

579
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:17,798
You don't know who you are.

580
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:22,358
You disgrace our people.

581
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,404
Our people?

582
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:28,196
Our people who have let oyinbo
come in and use us?

583
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:31,325
Our people who don't protect
what we have got?

584
00:44:31,487 --> 00:44:33,478
Even so,

585
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:36,437
when we die,

586
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,998
our souls return to the place of birth.

587
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,479
You have abandoned yours.

588
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,757
You must embrace it

589
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:51,157
if you want peace.

590
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,796
Well, Simon,
your urine test came in negative.

591
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:34,962
- You see? l'm drug-free.
- Yeah, that's great.

592
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:37,402
So how are you feeling physically,
detox?

593
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:41,560
l have the heart of a lion, Sister.

594
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:46,799
Well, l'll be. You actually look happy.

595
00:45:46,967 --> 00:45:48,764
You were right.

596
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:53,277
ln snorting all that shit,
l was avoiding something.

597
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:54,516
Myself.

598
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,079
But you know,

599
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:03,559
since the first time l came to Oz,

600
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:07,037
l found:

601
00:46:10,447 --> 00:46:12,085
Family.

602
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:16,402
Nappa's saying
he's the man in charge now.

603
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:19,400
He's got the tits
and he's got Adebisi by the balls.

604
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:22,206
Let him talk all the shit
he wants, okay? Fuck Nappa.

605
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:24,801
Yeah, well, l don't know
how you can trust Adebisi now.

606
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:28,437
l mean, just fucking look at the guy.

607
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,763
l remember the peace.

608
00:46:32,927 --> 00:46:34,679
l remember.

609
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:39,437
You see what l'm saying?

610
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:49,326
That was bad, what you said.

611
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:53,116
Yeah, well, in Oz, bad is good.

612
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:57,639
Adebisi and his crew,
they're starting to crack.

613
00:46:57,807 --> 00:47:00,037
l'd give it a couple of days
before approaching them.

614
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:01,481
Good.

615
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:03,922
l need you to find out
something else for me.

616
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,157
Yeah? What's that?

617
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:08,365
Adebisi isn't just detoxing.

618
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:11,519
Something or someone
is screwing with his head.

619
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:13,484
You mean that guy Jara?

620
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:16,957
Man, they got some strange shit
going on.

621
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:29,124
O'Reily, you a user?

622
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:30,720
Not anymore.

623
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:32,878
Tits are purely for profit.

624
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:37,120
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- Likewise.

625
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:41,116
- That old man Jara.
- Yeah?

626
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:43,357
l want him dead.

627
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:56,804
- Anybody smell garlic?
- Hey, fuck you.

628
00:47:56,967 --> 00:48:00,198
Easy, everybody.
We didn't come here to fight.

629
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:04,524
Your man, Adebisi,
he's lost his edge.

630
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,121
No, he just a little sick, that's all.
He'll be all right.

631
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,801
Really?
l got control of all the tits in Oz.

632
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,036
You guys got shit.

633
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:14,119
Now, rather than us taking shots
at each other,

634
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,881
l say we call a truce
and work together.

635
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:19,083
We have our own operation.
We don't need you.

636
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:20,646
Think about that for a moment.

637
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:24,038
Who's gonna get every pair of tits
that comes in this place, huh?

638
00:48:24,207 --> 00:48:26,960
Make the smart decision here.

639
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:37,036
We ain't gonna be your bitches.

640
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:40,324
Hey, we work together, we share.

641
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:43,678
We in business?

642
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:53,677
Now, as a sign of good faith,
there's a little job l need done.

643
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:02,960
Adebisi.

644
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:05,800
Why you letting that old motherfucker
work in the kitchen with us, huh?

645
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:08,037
He's slowing us down.

646
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:10,243
Shut up, Kenny.

647
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,724
l need more corn.

648
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,167
Die, old man.

649
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,526
Jara.

650
00:49:57,927 --> 00:49:59,360
Jara.

651
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:01,436
What happened? What happened?

652
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:03,325
No, don't speak. Don't speak.
Don't speak.

653
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:06,843
- l can't breathe.
- Don't talk, l'll get some help.

654
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,679
Get me some help!

655
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:11,520
Help me. Don't talk.

656
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:14,838
l'm going home.

657
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:17,965
- No, don't leave me.
- l'm going home.

658
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,197
Jara, Jara, don't. Jara.

659
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:23,518
See you, brother.

660
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,564
See you.

661
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:27,479
Jara?

662
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:29,239
Don't leave me.

663
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:49,556
Can you hear the drums?
Can you hear them?

664
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:56,439
Okay, Adebisi, settle down.

665
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:59,440
lt's okay, settle down.
Johnson, grab him.

666
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:04,164
Okay. We're just gonna
bring you somewhere

667
00:52:04,327 --> 00:52:06,079
where they talk to you
and write everything down.

668
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:07,646
Back to your cells, come on.

669
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,604
You were there. How can you
not know what happened?

670
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:11,280
l don't know what happened.

671
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:15,645
Adebisi's been going through detox
and acting all crazy lately.

672
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:18,685
And then he goes and stabs
that sweet old man.

673
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:20,915
l don't know.

674
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:22,759
l just don't know.

675
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:08,203
There are legal ways
to escape from Oz.

676
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:12,121
Parole hearings, court appeals,
and then there's clemency.

677
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:13,276
Clemency.

678
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:18,999
lt sounds so benign, doesn't it?
So purifying.

679
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,443
The phone's ready for you.

680
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,643
Thank you, my brother.

681
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:40,121
His radio show
has thousands of listeners.

682
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,596
lf we don't ask, we'll never know.

683
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:54,596
Yes, this is Kareem Said.

684
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:57,440
l have an interview scheduled
for 1 0:30.

685
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:00,479
Yes.

686
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:05,481
Alaikum salaam, my brother.

687
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:08,115
Oh, yes, l am he.

688
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,481
Let me first say,

689
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,923
l'm really sorry, l didn't know much
about your radio show.

690
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:17,117
lnside Oswald, we are restricted
in what we see,

691
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:19,755
hear, and are exposed to.

692
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:24,205
That is another reason
why l wrote my new book.

693
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,200
- l say we institute a ''no swearing'' rule.
- Fuck you.

694
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:28,595
Suck my dick.

695
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,246
- Asswipe.
- Cocksucker.

696
00:54:30,407 --> 00:54:32,762
- You stupid cunt.
- Putz.

697
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:35,157
lf nobody has anything
more intelligent to say,

698
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:36,919
this meeting is adjourned.

699
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:45,245
- Said.
- Yes?

700
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,840
l'll take him back to Em City.

701
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:48,760
lt's about Poet.

702
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:50,519
l've tried talking to him
several times,

703
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,917
but he's completely closed himself
off to me.

704
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:54,918
Have you talked to him?

705
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,156
What's the point?

706
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:58,363
Well, to try to reach him.

707
00:54:58,527 --> 00:55:00,404
To start over.

708
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,396
l've done everything l could
to help that boy.

709
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,364
So have you.

710
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:08,358
l'm done with him.

711
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:11,166
Hey, wait a second. What's this?

712
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:15,115
Where's your every-soul-is-redeemable,
never-give-up attitude?

713
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:18,006
Yeah, where is it, McManus?

714
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:20,997
You know, when l was arrested,

715
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:25,604
l thought to myself,
''Hey, this is the will of Allah.

716
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:28,281
l can go to Oz
and l can help my brothers.''

717
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:30,597
And you haven't.

718
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:32,917
l feel the same way sometimes.

719
00:55:33,087 --> 00:55:36,762
l know you do, McManus.
l see you.

720
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:40,399
The difference is,
you can go home every night.

721
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:43,479
You're free to quit,
get yourself another job.

722
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:48,238
l'm gonna be here
for another 1 7 years.

723
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,276
l've been thinking a lot

724
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,756
about what else
l could have done with that time.

725
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:54,758
You mean like have a family?

726
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:57,122
Oh, yes.

727
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,359
You still can when you get out.
You're not too old.

728
00:56:00,887 --> 00:56:02,559
After two decades
in maximum security,

729
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,400
what the hell would l have
to offer a wife?

730
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:08,079
What could l offer a child?

731
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,199
Your faith.

732
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:13,401
l thought your faith sustained you.

733
00:56:15,487 --> 00:56:17,364
lt does.

734
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:21,398
Most of the time.

735
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:26,515
Attention.

736
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:29,918
The following prisoners
are to report to the warden's office:

737
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:33,397
97F444, Kareem Said.

738
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:36,957
97 A622, Zahir Arif.

739
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,437
89B267, Nasim Bismilla.

740
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:44,759
85A245, Sanjay Afsana.

741
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:47,160
Said.

742
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,320
Have a seat.

743
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:57,165
Said, every year,
the governor grants clemency

744
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:58,362
for a number of prisoners.

745
00:56:58,527 --> 00:56:59,801
Just around Christmastime.

746
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:02,276
This year, he's decided to do
two special releases:

747
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:05,723
- One for Passover, one for Ramadan.
- l know all about this.

748
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:07,479
l've been working
with other lslamic leaders

749
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:09,444
trying to get the government
to initiate it.

750
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:12,041
Right. Devlin's asked us
to go over the case files

751
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:15,085
of our Muslim prisoners
and recommend a candidate.

752
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:17,715
But he specifically wanted us
to consider you.

753
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:23,078
This is a trick, right?

754
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:25,879
There has to be strings attached.

755
00:57:27,607 --> 00:57:29,882
Exactly what do l have to give up
to gain my freedom?

756
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,480
Nothing.

757
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,958
The big question is:

758
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:37,915
lf the governor offers clemency,
will you take it?

759
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,240
Yes.

760
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,723
l tell you this. We must be happy
for whichever one of us is chosen.

761
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:54,447
Yeah, especially if it's you.

762
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:58,885
- Arif?
- l'm sorry.

763
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,924
lt's just that l have children.

764
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:04,841
l know they're being cared for,
but it's not the same thing.

765
00:58:05,007 --> 00:58:06,998
They miss me.

766
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:08,680
l miss them.

767
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:10,439
l know.

768
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:12,680
Do you?

769
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:41,043
- lt's all about Said.
- lt's the will of Allah.

770
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:42,606
Come on, now--

771
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,202
Stop it.

772
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:48,916
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
Step away.

773
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:51,519
Madness.

774
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:55,361
Come on. Come here.

775
00:58:59,527 --> 00:59:01,404
You're the one.

776
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:03,683
The one Devlin's chosen.

777
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:15,680
Ramadan starts Thursday.

778
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:19,201
He's doing a press conference.

779
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:21,719
l...

780
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,043
l feel like
l should congratulate you, but...

781
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:26,686
But what?

782
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,405
Don't tell me you're gonna miss me.

783
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:30,683
No, not at all.

784
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:32,840
lt's just...

785
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:36,122
None of this sits right with me.

786
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:52,205
The celebration of Ramadan
is at the centre of lslamic worship.

787
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:57,395
Therefore, l'm pleased,
in the grand tradition of this holy time,

788
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,321
to bestow clemency on a prisoner.

789
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:05,446
Kareem Said
has been an outspoken critic

790
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:07,882
of our administration,
but political differences aside,

791
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:11,801
he has been an outstanding member
of the prison population.

792
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,844
Even after suffering
a heart attack last year,

793
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:16,567
he's continued to work with prisoners
of every race and colour,

794
01:00:16,727 --> 01:00:21,960
especially the young, to instruct them,
and guide them to better lives.

795
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:27,201
So l hereby grant Kareem Said

796
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:29,483
a full pardon

797
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:33,563
and l wish him well in his new life.

798
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:36,922
Congratulations, Said.

799
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:44,680
Finally, we meet, face to face.

800
01:00:44,847 --> 01:00:46,803
Mr. Said, how do you feel?

801
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,964
How do l feel?

802
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:54,637
l feel joyless.

803
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:57,921
My brothers remain behind.

804
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,601
lmprisoned, suppressed.

805
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:03,963
l don't just mean
my Muslim brothers, l mean

806
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,846
every single man
that will sleep in here tonight,

807
01:01:07,007 --> 01:01:09,521
that was cut off
from everything that he loves.

808
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:12,802
Cut off from his own self.

809
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:15,921
You know,
as the word went around

810
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:19,124
that the governor was gonna give
somebody clemency,

811
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:23,000
l saw a rift develop

812
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:26,523
as each inmate wished himself
to be the chosen one.

813
01:01:28,327 --> 01:01:32,240
The longing to be free became
as palpable as the food that we eat.

814
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:38,925
But it is a meal
that l am being served right now.

815
01:01:40,287 --> 01:01:42,482
And l am Muslim.

816
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:47,482
And Allah does not allow me
to swallow certain things.

817
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,285
Allah does not allow me
to take scraps

818
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:52,996
from the hands of a man
such as this.

819
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,202
A man who is corrupt

820
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:56,919
and immoral.

821
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:58,918
A man who denigrates
the gift of clemency

822
01:01:59,087 --> 01:02:01,237
just as he violates
the principles of justice.

823
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:06,561
A man that gave the order
that caused the death of eight people.

824
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:09,036
And so, Governor Devlin,

825
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:12,119
because even the cost of freedom
can be too high,

826
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:14,917
l refuse your pardon.

827
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:23,039
Officer, take him back inside.

828
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:24,956
Cocksucker.

829
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:37,523
- Take him back inside.
- Stupid.

830
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:45,045
How do you respond to this,
governor?

831
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:55,719
Said.

832
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:59,120
Said, Said, Said...

833
01:03:26,327 --> 01:03:27,965
Yeah.

834
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:32,120
Everybody wants to escape
from Oz.

835
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:35,882
Of course, the truth is,
there is no escape.

836
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:38,800
l mean, let's say
you manage to sneak out.

837
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:42,676
Then you gotta run
and keep running.

838
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,725
And a life of running away
ain't no life at all.

839
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:48,082
Better to stay put, face reality,

840
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:50,807
deal with what you got
and make the best of it.

841
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:52,446
Yeah.

842
01:03:52,847 --> 01:03:56,760
The measure of a man
is not where he lives, but how.

843
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,883
How he makes the best of it.

844
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:01,356
Make the best of it.

845
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:05,158
Later.
