1
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,374
"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
nor gloom of night...

2
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:45,942
"stays these couriers from the swift
completion of their appointed rounds."

3
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:51,213
So says the United States Postal Service
in their sunshine motto...

4
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,226
adapted from the Ancient Greek
historian Herodotus.

5
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:57,354
Back then, "swift" could have meant
a year and a day.

6
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:00,366
Now it's 10:00 a.m.
The next morning anywhere...

7
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,231
from here to Cochabamba.

8
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,567
People all over the globe
every afternoon stand at their mailboxes...

9
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:09,473
wondering what might be inside.
You never know what to expect.

10
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:11,738
And in Oz, most times...

11
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,079
the best part is the expectation.

12
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>Prisoner number 99C124, William Cudney.</i>

13
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,276
<i>Convicted February 10, '99.</i>
<i>Murder in the first degree.</i>

14
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:48,676
Sentence: Life without the possibility
of parole.

15
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:53,378
She got an abortion behind your back,
without telling you.

16
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,979
I forget what abortion is.

17
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,959
It's when the baby goes to Heaven
without ever getting born.

18
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,687
Let me get this straight.

19
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:05,288
You aim for the doctor,
but you got the son instead.

20
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:09,301
- No, I aimed for the son.
- You took out the kid on purpose?

21
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,235
Yeah. Now that doctor knows how I feel.

22
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:15,534
He killed my baby, I killed his.

23
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:26,777
What are you gonna say to him
when you see him?

24
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:27,911
Who?

25
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,152
The doctor's son up in Heaven.

26
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,690
I already know what I'm gonna say
to Dr. Nathan's husband...

27
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,559
if they let me in.

28
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:50,102
Where the fuck have you been?

29
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:53,009
Come on. We don't got a lot of time left.
Put these on.

30
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,242
- No.
- Cyril, don't start with me.

31
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,476
- I don't wanna box. I don't have to box.
- Yeah, you do.

32
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:03,421
No, Mr. Cudney said I don't have to.

33
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:05,981
- Cudney?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,590
God doesn't want me to box.

35
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,031
Okay, no boxing today.

36
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,897
- You're not mad?
- No.

37
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:23,734
As a matter of fact, I think
you should listen to what Mr. Cudney says.

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,211
It's okay.

39
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,285
O'Reily. You come to join
our prayer meeting?

40
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:38,816
Yeah.

41
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,690
"Woe is me.
This is a sickness and I must bear it."

42
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:48,625
First you go tell my brother it's okay to box.

43
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:52,634
Then you promise me
you'll never talk to him again.

44
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,970
Got that?

45
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,714
I never had much use for the Bible before.
Mind if I keep this?

46
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,111
- No.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

47
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,953
Gloria.

48
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,416
- Watch yourself, O'Reily.
- Cocksucker.

49
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,359
- Yo, Bricks.
- O'Reily.

50
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,560
You're the only one that get that shit right.

51
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,036
You're checkin' out the competition?

52
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,802
Man, they better pray.

53
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,866
My man Bricks
about to wipe the canvas with them.

54
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,903
I don't know, man. I saw Khan
working out in the gym. He's peak.

55
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,045
- So is my nigger here.
- Let's go get high.

56
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:39,142
Hold on.

57
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,517
You think you ought to get high
on your first fight?

58
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:46,558
Shit, yeah. I'm Mike Tyson, man.
I party, then I fight, then I party some more.

59
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,453
See you.

60
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:55,226
Pancamo.
Put me down for five Grovers on Khan.

61
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,134
- It's a big bet.
- I got money to burn, man.

62
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,237
Hamid?

63
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,302
Yes?

64
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:07,244
You should know that Wangler's
been talking trash about you and Said.

65
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:09,838
It's time you taught that heathen homeboy
a lesson.

66
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:14,080
Don't worry, I intend to win.
In the name of Allah.

67
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,151
Yeah, whatever. Just kick his ass.

68
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,043
Yeah, right.

69
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,042
Kenny "Bricks" Wangler!

70
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,968
And in this corner, Hamid Khan!

71
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,477
Listen to me at all times.
Touch gloves and go to your corners.

72
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,543
Ready! Ring the bell!

73
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,226
Stick a punch, Khan!

74
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:30,652
Bricks, nice one, man.
You're like Tyson, all right. Cecily Tyson!

75
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,063
A package arrives unexpected. You open it.

76
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,263
Sometimes, it's a gift...

77
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:45,304
bottle of vintage wine,
let's say, from a relative.

78
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,635
Sometimes, it's from the Unabomber.

79
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:50,870
An innocent-looking box that goes boom.

80
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,543
Yo, those Muslims fuck with us,
now it's our turn to fuck with them.

81
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:09,122
I got a poem. I got a poem, man.

82
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:14,858
Ever since I got back in Oz,
I ain't been writing no poetry.

83
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:19,168
But I got inspired by something I saw
the other day.

84
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,542
So, this poem right here
is dedicated to Minister Kareem Said.

85
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,443
"That's it

86
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,213
"I figured you easy

87
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,788
"All you wanna do is get your palm greasy

88
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,392
"Capitalize

89
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,951
"See, fucking America been in your eyes

90
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,896
"For more than 450 years

91
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,267
"And now you wanna hide your tears

92
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:54,034
"In your so-called Allah-given mission
to help your brothers

93
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:58,541
"Well, Allah gave me a vision
and I'm gonna tell all the others

94
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:02,411
"Talking about revolution
What I saw, that was revelation

95
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:06,045
"You frolicking with the Devil's maiden

96
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:13,990
"Now you happy
'cause now you can manipulate her think

97
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,429
"Well, I'm gonna put you on to something
while we locked up here in this clink

98
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:21,126
"While you trying to get us all
into the Heaven above

99
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,761
"When she forget
about your contradictorial ass

100
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,100
"Make sure you hide them bloody gloves"

101
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:03,208
This has gone from a private humiliation
to a public one.

102
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:07,269
- You disgrace us all.
- You have a choice, Said.

103
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,742
Her or us.

104
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:14,117
You either promise
to never see that woman again...

105
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:15,950
or you are finished.

106
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,090
Finished?

107
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,963
We'll choose someone else to lead.

108
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,548
Tell me what's wrong.

109
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,084
I've been getting these phone calls...

110
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:57,026
threatening phone calls,
demanding that I stay away from you.

111
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,192
Stay away from me?

112
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,536
I saved the tape from the machine.
I thought maybe...

113
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,406
you might want it,
or the lawyer or somebody.

114
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:21,075
- Did you change your telephone number?
- Yeah.

115
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,087
But I can't just move.

116
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,452
What if they find out where I live?

117
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,034
I just don't understand.

118
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,628
Why are they telling me
to stay away from you?

119
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:41,798
Don't you worry about that.

120
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:46,139
I'll speak with Zelman.
He'll know best how to handle this.

121
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:50,514
- How to protect you.
- I don't want to stay away from you.

122
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:59,013
Fuck them. Oh, God, sorry.

123
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,393
No, you're right.

124
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:05,327
Fuck them.

125
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:30,120
Tell me neither of you know anything
about threatening calls to Tricia Ross.

126
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:31,782
Tell me.

127
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:41,465
Because whoever it was will pay.

128
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:44,499
In this life or the next.

129
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:10,286
When I got married,
I got my wife's name tattooed on my arm.

130
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,194
Pretty stupid, huh?

131
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,136
Like a marriage is ever gonna last
as long as a fucking tattoo.

132
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:24,806
I told Shannon that I wanted a divorce...

133
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,111
'cause of what I feel for Gloria.

134
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,716
I still love Gloria,
and I try to fight it but I can't.

135
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,714
She's under my skin, man.

136
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,988
She's under my fucking skin.

137
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,334
Come on, man,
I'll kick the shit out of that motherfucker.

138
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,737
- All right? One love!
- You'll have fun getting your ass whipped.

139
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:58,470
You ask us to help you take out
Wangler, Pierce, Poet...

140
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,205
then you say wait.

141
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,971
I don't want to kill them...

142
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:05,415
or there will be a war between us
and the other homeboys.

143
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:08,146
- Just want to slow them down.
- He's right.

144
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:11,213
We got to make the deed
look like an accident.

145
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,922
Poet and Pierce first.

146
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:17,289
I have my own plans for Wangler.

147
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:26,366
Bricks! Damn. Bricks, man!

148
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,207
- I need to talk to you.
- What?

149
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,334
It's bad news.

150
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,641
- Your wife's dead.
- What?

151
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,618
She was shot, execution style.

152
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,352
- Oh, shit.
- That's too bad, yo.

153
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,324
Real sorrowful, Kenny. Real sorrowful.

154
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,158
- There's more.
- What?

155
00:15:55,601 --> 00:16:00,004
She was found in the apartment
with another man. A Ronnie Smith.

156
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:03,269
Oh, damn. Ronnie. That was my boy.

157
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,141
They were found in bed together.

158
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:13,475
I've scheduled some time for you
to see Sister Peter Marie.

159
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,047
My baby. How's my son?

160
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:19,888
He's fine.
He was at your mother's at the time.

161
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:21,315
Amen.

162
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:24,795
- Anything I can do?
- No.

163
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,429
Do the cops know who did this shit?

164
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,833
They think it was drug related.

165
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,269
Can I go to the funeral?

166
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:38,142
I'll see what I can do.

167
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,565
I thought I was gonna die
to keep from laughing.

168
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:05,226
Hold on, wait.
What about when I gave him this face?

169
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,170
No, don't.

170
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:13,245
Yo, Kenny, you wanted that bitch dead
and Ronnie dead...

171
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:16,804
now they dead. Who loves you, baby?

172
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,282
- Y'all do, yo.
- Handle it, right?

173
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,876
Let's go get high.

174
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:27,114
Of course, any kind of letter from
the outside is a potential bomb...

175
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:30,060
blowing up in your face with memories
of what life was like...

176
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,359
before the gates slammed shut.

177
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:35,901
Before someone,
definitely not your momma...

178
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,899
screamed, "Lights out!"

179
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:45,166
<i>Sometimes the sweeter the letter,</i>
<i>the more bitter the aftertaste.</i>

180
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:49,007
<i>"My dear son...</i>

181
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:53,313
<i>"I woke up today dreaming of</i>
<i>what life would be like when you are free.</i>

182
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,253
<i>"Telling myself that every day</i>
<i>is one day closer to you coming home.</i>

183
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,761
<i>"One day closer to us being together again.</i>

184
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,560
<i>"Everything here is the same.</i>

185
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,634
<i>"The neighborhood is the same.</i>

186
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:23,643
<i>"Even the faces, everyone looks the same.</i>

187
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,779
<i>"Is everything there okay?</i>

188
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:36,153
<i>"Is there anything we can do?</i>

189
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,633
<i>"We miss you.</i>

190
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,162
<i>"We love you."</i>

191
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,852
I can't stand the pain.

192
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:12,290
- I didn't see a thing.
- What about you?

193
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,896
Lockdown!

194
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,100
Junior, what up?

195
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:02,038
Junior, why we in lockdown?

196
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,220
Welcome back, Kenny.

197
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,995
Pity what happened to Poet and Pierce.

198
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,802
- They gonna live?
- For now.

199
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:32,074
- But you know life is fragile, man.
- What about me?

200
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:42,684
How you doing with that program, man?
You meet with Rivera yet, face to face?

201
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:47,587
No. Just, you know,
mostly talking to Sister Peter Marie.

202
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,659
- About?
- This and that.

203
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:55,125
As long as "this" doesn't connect to "that"...

204
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,998
you're safe with me.

205
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,403
I want to warn you, Miguel,
there's no way to predict...

206
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:07,878
the outcome emotionally
of facing Officer Rivera or his wife.

207
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,809
When you blinded him, you hurt them both.

208
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,614
And they may have no sympathy...

209
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:19,215
for any pain or guilt you're feeling.

210
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:24,018
So why don't you tell me what you did
to Eugene Rivera?

211
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,461
You know what I did.

212
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:28,261
I don't see why we gotta
waste time rehashing it.

213
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,529
We have all the time we need.

214
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:34,494
It's very important to articulate
what you've done.

215
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:37,303
So, when was it?

216
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,444
Last summer.

217
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:45,444
- Why did you do it?
- I don't know.

218
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:48,514
You know, I was all fucked up and shit.

219
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:53,452
Some stuff going on, and I got tense.

220
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,429
I don't know, you know. It just happened.

221
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,130
What just happened?

222
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:07,595
- What did you, Miguel Alvarez, do?
- Shit!

223
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,115
- I cut his eyes really bad.
- How bad?

224
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:24,845
I stabbed them. You know, I stabbed them.

225
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,387
His eyes, you know.

226
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,152
<i>The scalpel...</i>

227
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,567
I dropped it.

228
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,066
When it hit the floor...

229
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:45,535
it made this ringing sound.

230
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:50,542
Okay.

231
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,249
Would you like to sit down?

232
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:05,028
Why did you do it?

233
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,760
I already told you.

234
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:11,600
- It's 'cause of tension and shit.
- No, Miguel.

235
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:18,709
Why you did this. Something so deliberate.

236
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:23,379
You're gonna have to tell Eugene why,
and he's going to ask.

237
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,544
I will.

238
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:28,981
Why can't you tell me?

239
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:31,552
Because I don't owe it to you.

240
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,724
This is who I want to sit down with.

241
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,629
Face to face and ask why.

242
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,269
- He's here now, Eugene.
- Really?

243
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:56,078
So what's his answer?
I don't hear his voice.

244
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:59,381
All I hear is voices that sound like my own...

245
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,284
but they don't say why Alvarez did this.

246
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:05,213
They don't tell me why I deserve it.

247
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,284
What happened was not your fault.

248
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:14,424
And God is not going to answer
your questions...

249
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,400
in a big booming voice.

250
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,467
He's going to answer you
through talking to Alvarez.

251
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,408
So why don't you tell me
what you want to say to him.

252
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,276
I keep thinking
someone is gonna open a door...

253
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,748
and let me out of this dark room.

254
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:33,582
What else?

255
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:37,115
- What else do you wanna say?
- I can't. Not in front of you.

256
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:41,785
Come on, I'm a big girl.
Go ahead, whatever it is. Say it.

257
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,264
I hate you, Alvarez...

258
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,927
you fucking motherfucker.

259
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:55,169
'Cause of you I gotta carry around
all this shit in the dark.

260
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,437
If it wasn't for Tina,
I would have killed myself already.

261
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,343
Sometimes I think I should kill myself
for her sake...

262
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:04,211
so she could start a new life without me.

263
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,809
Some days, Alvarez, I wish you would have
killed me instead of doing this.

264
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:16,584
I can't cry anymore. Did you know that?

265
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:19,557
You made it so I can't cry.

266
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:35,570
Junk mail.

267
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:39,083
Selling you this, promising you that.
Publishers Clearing House...

268
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:41,085
you got
your American Family Sweepstakes...

269
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:43,621
You got Ed McMahon warning you
to open that envelope...

270
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,520
because you could be a millionaire.

271
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,991
And you know you can never win...

272
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,485
so you toss it.

273
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,892
But what if you made the wrong choice?

274
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:59,200
What if this was
the one-in-a-trillion time you win?

275
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:04,006
Man, this sexual harassment thing
is eating away at me.

276
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:08,504
State settles out of court,
reinstates Howell to her job...

277
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,708
which implies my guilt.
But I'm not fucking guilty.

278
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,978
You're a victim of the times, my friend.

279
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:16,646
Years ago, a woman complained
of workplace harassment...

280
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:19,418
no one believed her. No one even cared.

281
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:24,319
Today, it's assumed that every guy
in every office is an ass-grabbing pig.

282
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,494
- Which, of course, we are.
- No, I'm not!

283
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:31,593
Come on. You said you fucked every woman
that worked in this place...

284
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,638
except for Sister Peter Marie.

285
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:35,400
So I slept around.

286
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,831
It's always been mutual.

287
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:42,473
I would never force my way on a woman,
use my position to get laid.

288
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,338
- Prove it.
- How?

289
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,752
Don't let the state settle. Take her to court.

290
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,152
Get Nathan, and Wittlesey,
and Sister Peter Marie...

291
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:53,020
to testify on your behalf.

292
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:56,288
- You know, fight Howell.
- The odds are against me.

293
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:59,395
When are they ever in your favor?

294
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,665
For the media,
this is like a seven-course meal.

295
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:11,204
Meaning, if I wanna take this any further,
I better be prepared to see my face on TV...

296
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:12,971
- and in the headlines.
- Yes.

297
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:17,448
And if the public only half listens,
only retains half of what they read...

298
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,814
the story will burn hot for a few days...

299
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:22,877
you'll look guilty at first,
regardless of the facts...

300
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,855
then the story will cool.

301
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,255
By the time we win, no one will know.

302
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:30,659
But you'll have to carry the stigma
of those first few days with you...

303
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,754
for the rest of your life.

304
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:39,234
Gloria, what have you heard
about this harassment case against Tim?

305
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:43,833
Claire Howell in solitary
says that Tim had her fired...

306
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:46,639
because she stopped having sex with him.

307
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,377
I don't believe it, do you?

308
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:51,573
No.

309
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,143
But?

310
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,411
I dated Tim.
You know, when I was separated.

311
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:01,890
When it comes
to sex and relationships he's...

312
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:06,963
I don't know. Today, anything's possible.

313
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,168
Pete, Gloria, I'm glad you're both here.

314
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,536
I'm putting together my case...

315
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:16,301
and I'd like you both
to be character witnesses.

316
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,206
- Sure.
- Thanks.

317
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:21,571
- Gloria?
- Yeah, I'll let you know.

318
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:24,814
What? You don't believe Claire Howell,
do you?

319
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:28,819
No, I just want to talk to her, hear her side.

320
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,249
Her side?

321
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,857
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

322
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,688
That you think
what she's saying might be true?

323
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:39,561
Which means I'm lying, which means
you think I'm capable of abusing women.

324
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:40,620
No, I didn't mean...

325
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:43,463
Thanks a lot. Thanks for the vote
of fucking confidence.

326
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,025
Tim, wait a...

327
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:11,427
How's Dee Dee?

328
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:15,229
She misses her grandma. So do I.

329
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,070
We got all manner of men in here.

330
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,076
Men who've raped women, beaten them,
murdered them.

331
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:30,514
Ryan O'Reily had Gloria's husband killed
because Ryan loved her so much.

332
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:33,509
I remember thinking at the time:

333
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:35,486
"Such passion...

334
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,620
"Could I ever feel such passion?"

335
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:45,526
You know,
I was gonna fight this harassment charge.

336
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:49,129
I was gonna ask you and Gloria
to testify on my behalf...

337
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:53,604
build a case because Howell is lying.
I didn't force her to do anything.

338
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:57,739
- Then why not fight it?
- Because I am guilty.

339
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:01,304
Of using her, her body.

340
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:05,909
Of not giving a shit about her...

341
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:10,249
about her feelings for me,
about her feelings for herself.

342
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:15,154
Now I know I did the same thing
to my ex-wife.

343
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,661
To Gloria.

344
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,859
To you.

345
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:34,376
Diane, if I asked you to testify on my behalf,
would you have done it?

346
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,376
Sure.

347
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:42,644
'Cause what we had was real...

348
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,989
if only for a moment.

349
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:22,017
<i>Prisoner number 99K8</i>7 <i>1, Yuri Kosygin.</i>

350
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,058
<i>Convicted March 23, '99.</i>

351
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,066
Eight counts murder in the first degree,
four counts attempted murder...

352
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:31,227
illegal possession of a firearm.

353
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:35,433
Sentence: Life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.

354
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,732
Nikolai Stanislofsky, Yuri Kosygin.

355
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:19,741
Are you here to kill me?

356
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,091
Okay...

357
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:33,492
according to your work assignment...

358
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:36,591
you're to be here in the library
from noon till 3:00...

359
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:39,193
helping out the librarian, you know...

360
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,872
Rearranging books on the shelf.

361
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:48,538
You're also to take the book cart
to the hospital ward...

362
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,478
and to the AIDS ward, and Unit E.

363
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:59,715
- You understanding any of this?
- Yes.

364
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:03,860
Breathe or something every once in a while.

365
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,466
Sit over there till Mrs. Hubble comes back.

366
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:20,939
You're Kosygin, right? I heard of you.

367
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:25,381
The most brutal hitter in Little Odessa.
Antonio Nappa.

368
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,579
I'm extending my hand to you in friendship.

369
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,581
I don't need your friendship.

370
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:33,415
Fine.

371
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,323
Let me tell you something.

372
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:39,563
My boys control everything that goes
in and out of this joint.

373
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,496
Drugs, cigarettes, gambling.

374
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:45,764
You decide to start your bullshit here,
you won't live till morning.

375
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,768
You Italians.

376
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:50,969
So melodramatic.

377
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:56,906
Yes?

378
00:33:57,215 --> 00:34:00,616
Got word from Mr. Nappa.
Your pal, what's-his-name...

379
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:02,479
needs to learn a little respect.

380
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:04,921
Kosygin is no pal of mine.

381
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,448
I'm a Jew. He's Cossack.

382
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:10,961
In my community,
he's feared for his savagery.

383
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:16,124
You Sicilians think you're so tough.

384
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:19,932
He would cut out your heart,
eat it, and not think twice.

385
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:26,300
Yeah, well, you better talk to him.

386
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:28,477
Before I do.

387
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:45,588
- So what do you think?
- About what?

388
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:48,028
The new guy, Kosygin.

389
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,296
I tried to chat with him during dinner.
He sat there frozen like the tundra.

390
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:57,703
- He scares the living shit out of me.
- Me, too.

391
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:03,445
Lights out.

392
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:24,596
- What you got there, Busmalis?
- I wrote Miss Sally a fan letter.

393
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,762
Oh, my God! Look.

394
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,740
- Fucking thing's autographed.
- They're fake.

395
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,501
- What?
- They're fake, the autographs.

396
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:35,740
- They're done by a machine.
- How do you know that?

397
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:41,112
All right, Miss Sally's may be real,
but not the puppets'. Especially not Nooter.

398
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,553
- Why not?
- He's got no hands. How's he gonna write?

399
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:46,188
With his mouth.

400
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:49,385
If he can swing a mallet with it,
he can certainly write with it.

401
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:50,860
There's a letter.

402
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:55,492
"Dear Agamemnon, thank you for writing.
Nooter, Pecky, and I are happy...

403
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,934
"that you like our show.
Keep watching, Miss Sally."

404
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,536
Form letter.

405
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,734
You're a cynical bastard.

406
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:06,470
Do you think Miss Sally sits and reads
every piece of mail she gets?

407
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,604
With a rack like that,
she'll be getting a million letters a day.

408
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:13,276
- They got a secretary to send that shit out.
- No. Really?

409
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:17,047
Live in your fantasy world.
What the hell do I care?

410
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:18,946
I got an idea.

411
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:23,160
We should write Miss Sally
and ask her to come visit.

412
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:26,356
- Visit?
- Sorry, bro. Miss Sally ain't coming to Oz.

413
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:30,094
She might. Who knows? I'll write her. Now.

414
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:34,166
Man, I'd still like to fuck her.

415
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,367
I wouldn't mind a four-way
with Nooter and Pecky.

416
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,636
What?

417
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:41,469
Visiting hours.

418
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,381
- Now I'll go see my family.
- Man, your people don't quit.

419
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,279
That's okay, bro.
Long as they keep bringing them goodies.

420
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:50,480
- No shit.
- One of these days...

421
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:54,548
I'm gonna have to tag along
just to thank your mom myself, okay?

422
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,823
Where's <i>Papi</i>?

423
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,862
What happened?

424
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,571
<i>Papi</i> had a stroke.

425
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,677
A stroke?

426
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:19,814
- When?
- Two nights ago at home.

427
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:23,086
Mommy was off from work, thank God.

428
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:27,147
- He's in intensive care.
- Shit. He's gonna make it?

429
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:32,362
They're doing what they can,
that's what the doctor said.

430
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,866
- I called him the other day to say sorry.
- For what?

431
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,006
Cursing Isabella.

432
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,313
But before I could...

433
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:58,320
we started talking about something else.

434
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:04,484
Something stupid. What was it?
God damn it, what was it?

435
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:07,598
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I can't remember!

436
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:13,736
I called to say sorry, but before I could
he asked me something first and I...

437
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:17,002
- Fuck!
- Keep it down, Ricardo.

438
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,613
Did he say anything to you guys?
After the last visit?

439
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:32,747
- About what?
- Stuff I said. Was he mad?

440
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:35,554
Carlo, it's okay. I don't think he was.

441
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,228
He loves you.

442
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:46,830
You wanna sleep, go back to your cell.

443
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:51,170
Yesterday, a letter arrived in Oz
postmarked May 7, 1965.

444
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,773
Thirty-four years. Must have got stuck
in the sorting machine or something.

445
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:59,044
Anyway, the inmate it's addressed to
is long dead.

446
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,978
So they take the envelope...

447
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:06,349
throw it in the dead-letter box,
without even opening it.

448
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:09,593
Now nobody's ever gonna know
what was inside.

449
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:15,127
Clayton, what are you still doing here?

450
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:18,902
Where did it happen, Leo?

451
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:23,401
I wanna know the exact spot
where my father died.

452
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,907
- Clayton...
- Show me.

453
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:42,358
Here. Right here.

454
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:04,574
You know, I've been wondering.
You think whoever killed Dad is still alive?

455
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:06,378
Still in Oz?

456
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:09,750
I got to wonder, is the guy
I'm standing over in the library...

457
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,312
the same animal who stabbed my dad?

458
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:20,125
Rebadow.

459
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:27,134
Seventeen years ago,
a CO was shanked during lunch.

460
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:32,233
- Do you remember?
- So many years, so many killings.

461
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:37,876
- They all blend into one.
- The CO's name was Samuel Hughes.

462
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:39,911
Your father?

463
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:42,586
Yes. Do you remember him?

464
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:46,287
I'm sorry.

465
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:50,457
- You have to remember something.
- I don't, I swear.

466
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,594
That's just not good enough.
I want you to think.

467
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:58,192
- Do you hear me, Rebadow? Think.
- Please, I...

468
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,666
You think about my father,
you goddamn son of a bitch!

469
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:02,967
Officer.

470
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:15,219
I don't know what to do.
Should I tell Leo what I saw?

471
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,518
Hughes has made a couple of big mistakes
since he started.

472
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,648
When he was working with me
in Emerald City...

473
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:22,454
he kept mixing it up with the Latinos...

474
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:25,189
then he pulled that knucklehead move
with the stun gun.

475
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:29,563
Still, there are extenuating circumstances.
His father was killed here.

476
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:32,797
That's got to be weighing on him,
and the warden.

477
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:35,536
I think your first instincts were right.

478
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:39,064
I think you should sit down with Clayton,
sort it out.

479
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:53,521
Father Mukada, I'm sorry for what you saw.

480
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,259
- I overreacted.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

481
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:01,587
Rebadow, sure.

482
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:06,592
All I want for you to know
is that I know how you feel.

483
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:11,103
So the next time
you wanna fly off into a rage...

484
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,910
you come talk to me.
And maybe together we can...

485
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:19,475
I don't know, maybe we can work through it.

486
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,718
The only thing that's gonna
get me through it is knowing who.

487
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:27,451
Who killed my dad.

488
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,493
Unless you can help me with that,
we got nothing to talk about, Father.

489
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:39,569
<i>Dear John</i>

490
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:44,531
Then, of course, there's the Dear John letter.
Or Jane, as the case may be.

491
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:47,578
When your loved one,
or ex-loved one by that point...

492
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:50,637
tells you how much you fucked up her life
and hurt her...

493
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:53,445
how much she gave to you
and tried to help you...

494
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:56,384
and all you did in return
was leave her swinging in the wind.

495
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:59,252
And yeah, she's found someone else.

496
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:02,981
Someone other than you
who really understands what love is.

497
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,960
<i>Dear John</i>

498
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:12,395
Let's talk about your pact with Schillinger.
You met him at Lardner, right?

499
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:16,198
How would you describe your relationship
with him there?

500
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:19,539
What's that thing you become
when you first go into the nunnery?

501
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,306
- A postulant?
- Yeah. I was a postulant.

502
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:25,281
He was Mother Superior.

503
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:31,319
You know, I got to tell you, Sister...

504
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:37,794
until I met you, I'd always thought
nuns were a bunch of old maids...

505
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:40,964
that had always just given up on life.

506
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,165
How'd you know?

507
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:46,731
Know what?

508
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:52,038
That God had called you,
you were supposed to be a nun?

509
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:55,709
I felt His love.

510
00:43:58,716 --> 00:44:02,982
- What's the love of God feel like?
- You'll know when it comes.

511
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:06,112
I doubt that.

512
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,122
Don't you got to take those vows, right?

513
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:13,256
Obedience, poverty, chastity.

514
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:17,359
At the end of the day, you go home
and your bed is empty.

515
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,060
It's not empty.

516
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,536
I forgot.

517
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:28,673
God's waiting there for you.
You're the bride of Christ.

518
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:30,539
Yes.

519
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:34,774
Still, there's got to be nights
when God's love feels cold.

520
00:44:36,654 --> 00:44:40,681
When you're lonely, when you wonder
if you made the wrong decision.

521
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,387
Have...

522
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,962
- Visiting hours. I got my ex coming.
- She's very beautiful.

523
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:58,003
That's Kitty. That was Kitty.
She's my first wife. I got Angelique today.

524
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:01,340
- How many ex-wives do you have?
- I got three.

525
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:04,381
Four if you count Bonnie.
I married her twice.

526
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:06,473
I was married, you know.

527
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:10,943
You never stop amazing me.
I'd like to hear more about that next time.

528
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:15,152
Yeah, next time
we're gonna talk about you, okay?

529
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:16,916
I look forward to it.

530
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:21,223
I like being in the same room
with you, Sister.

531
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:24,229
You give good aura.

532
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,315
Oh, my.

533
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:26,894
Withdrawal?

534
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:31,167
Okay, I've been there.

535
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:33,798
Here's what we do.

536
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:47,548
- Come on, just talk.
- About?

537
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,883
- Anything.
- I don't know, man.

538
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:58,293
You know,
when I went through withdrawal...

539
00:46:58,362 --> 00:47:03,061
I tried to figure out why I was taking drugs,
why I was being so self-destructive.

540
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,200
Yeah, and?

541
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:14,240
Where did you get that?

542
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:19,305
Your father.

543
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:23,481
On my first night here, he burnt it on.

544
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:26,653
Then he humiliated me.

545
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:29,921
Hurt me.

546
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:33,693
He hurt me real bad.

547
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,290
I got to tell you the truth, Andrew.

548
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:40,197
I hate your father.

549
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:43,103
You and me ain't that different.

550
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:48,104
We don't have to, you know.

551
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:51,108
We don't have to take drugs.

552
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:54,680
We don't have to kill ourselves
to pay that cocksucker back.

553
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:58,449
He doesn't deserve to have
that kind of control over our lives.

554
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:05,686
I was all alone
when I went through withdrawal.

555
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:09,155
I was like a little kid.

556
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:14,928
I just wanted my mother.

557
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,636
I just wanted my mom to hug me.

558
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,011
I miss my mom, too.

559
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:29,217
I know.

560
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:34,922
Come here. You're gonna be all right now.

561
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,389
It's all gonna be all right.

562
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,831
- Come in.
- I'm sorry we're late.

563
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,236
It's okay.

564
00:49:02,653 --> 00:49:05,622
I'd like to apologize to you all...

565
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:10,183
for the way I acted the last time I was here.

566
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:18,129
You see, I'm an addict...

567
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:27,540
and I'm hoping that with all of your help...

568
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,714
maybe I can take some control over my life.

569
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:36,282
Because I don't think
I've ever had control before.

570
00:49:37,554 --> 00:49:39,146
Welcome, Andrew.

571
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,652
It's all right, man.

572
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:02,773
- Hello, Dad.
- Andrew.

573
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:09,309
You did it. You're clean.

574
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:10,847
Yeah.

575
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:14,083
How'd you do it?

576
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:17,661
A little help from God and my friends.

577
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,990
- Yo, Vern.
- How you doing?

578
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:24,557
Came to get some exercise.
Work up a sweat.

579
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:27,396
They're gonna teach me how to wrestle.

580
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:31,898
That's fine. We'll just stand here and watch.

581
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:33,840
Get down on all fours.

582
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:35,834
Head up.

583
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:48,988
You been looking for me?

584
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:51,187
No.

585
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,489
Really?

586
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,031
I thought you'd be wanting to thank me
for what I did for him.

587
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,398
For getting your son off drugs.

588
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:03,163
I mean, I did accomplish the one thing
you could never do. I saved your boy's life.

589
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,502
Fuck you.

590
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:11,875
You need to adjust your attitude. If not...

591
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:15,585
I got no reason to keep being
the good friend to you that I am.

592
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,643
- Good friend?
- Yeah.

593
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:24,626
If not for what I have done,
then for what I haven't.

594
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:26,762
What's that?

595
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:31,298
I haven't fucked him. At least not yet.

596
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:36,770
You see, because I was there for Andrew...

597
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,298
when he needed someone,
holding him, comforting him...

598
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:44,578
I think he's developed
a little bit of a crush on me.

599
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:47,450
I have been tempted to at least...

600
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:51,846
deep-tongue him a couple of times...

601
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:55,788
but I knew that would upset you
so I haven't, even though...

602
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,591
he wants me to stick my dick up his ass.

603
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:06,028
And I'm afraid one of these nights,
he and I alone in our pod...

604
00:52:07,104 --> 00:52:09,868
I'm not gonna be able to control myself.

605
00:52:13,243 --> 00:52:15,711
You'll be dead before you get the chance.

606
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:19,177
You better hurry. Keller's getting horny...

607
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:22,309
and O'Reily's been talking about a three-way
with Cyril and Andy.

608
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,625
I need to speak with you.

609
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:42,665
- Go ahead.
- Over here.

610
00:53:00,123 --> 00:53:02,785
Andy, I'm very proud of you.

611
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,926
Kicking your habit like that.
And I'm hoping...

612
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:12,662
that now you and I can maybe start to have
more of a relationship.

613
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:16,469
What? You mean get closer?

614
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:19,506
Be a real father and son?

615
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:22,275
Yes.

616
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:24,874
Not a chance.

617
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:27,916
I got to get back to my pals.

618
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:31,785
Those are not the kind of men
you should be hanging out with.

619
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:33,516
As opposed to who?

620
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:37,793
Those standup individuals that make up
your merry little band?

621
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:39,657
I gotta tell you something.

622
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:43,598
My whole life, you crammed into my head
how superior we white folks are.

623
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:46,465
I don't see the truth in that.

624
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:50,198
I look around this room
and I see white faces...

625
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:52,668
and black faces, every color in between...

626
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:57,043
and the only thing that I know for sure
is that we're all shit.

627
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:03,811
You know, shit don't come in degrees.
White or black, shit is shit.

628
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:10,519
So fuck everything you believe in,
fuck everything you stand for, and fuck you.

629
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:12,323
Don't you dare talk to me like that!

630
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:14,990
Man, you hit me way too many times
growing up!

631
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:21,231
Get the fuck back!

632
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,371
- You fucking liar! Fuck you!
- Take him to the hole.

633
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:31,908
Fuck, you're an asshole!

634
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:45,894
A man does everything he can
for his children.

635
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:52,668
He provides for them...

636
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:56,167
worries about them...

637
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,647
sacrifices everything for their happiness.

638
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,114
- What's this?
- It's a little present from your father.

639
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,801
But when your own flesh and blood
renounces you...

640
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:33,207
you have no choice but to renounce them.

641
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:45,912
My son, Andrew, is dead to me.

642
00:56:05,642 --> 00:56:06,973
My son...

643
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:10,673
is dead.

644
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:19,578
Phase 4, this is Radio 320.
We got a problem here.

645
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,915
Prisoner has OD'd.

646
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:25,291
We're too late for the medics.
Send the morgue boys.

647
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:42,743
It worked.

648
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:46,341
Your plan worked perfectly.

649
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,476
Yeah.

650
00:56:57,594 --> 00:56:58,993
<i>The worst day...</i>

651
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:01,593
is when you wake up and realize...

652
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:04,691
you'll never get another piece of mail again.

653
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:09,130
Your family can't take it anymore,
your friends forget...

654
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:13,304
even the folks at charity correspondence
start to back off.

655
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:18,411
Soon, you'll give anything for
another piece of mail with your name on it...

656
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:20,950
to let you know you still exist...

657
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,676
to let you know you still matter...

658
00:57:25,856 --> 00:57:27,619
even to Ed McMahon.
