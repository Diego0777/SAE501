1
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,026
? It's years like these?

2
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,234
? That make
a young man old?

3
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,607
? Bend his back
against the promises?

4
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,272
? That life should hold?

5
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,078
? They can make him wise?

6
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,347
? They can drive him?

7
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,650
? To his knees?

8
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,820
? There ain't nothin'
comes for free?

9
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:12,191
? In days like these?

10
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,599
? But you can't reap?

11
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,196
? What you don't sow?

12
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,730
? And you can't plant?

13
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,141
? In hollow ground?

14
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,908
? So let us fill?

15
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:32,111
? This empty earth
with hope?

16
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,985
? Till the rains?

17
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,581
? Calm down?

18
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,628
? In days...?

19
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:48,623
? Like these.?

20
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,969
Your face.

21
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,407
This ain't shit.

22
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,143
You should've seen me
a few days ago.

23
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,811
You'd have been proud.

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,116
I ain't proud, Omar.
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,384
Me too.

26
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,517
I fucked up,
and I know that.

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,528
Look, if I tell you
why I was selling tits,

28
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,759
- you can't go to McManus, okay?
- You have my word.

29
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,232
Redding forced me.

30
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,828
I tried to tell the motherfucker no,
but he just wasn't hearing no.

31
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,034
And I was too much of an ass
for you to come and ask for help, right?

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,110
I needed those things
you said...

33
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,478
just to straighten
me out.

34
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,882
Shit, I even needed some
of that lke Turner treatment.

35
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,284
Look, I'm sorry,
you're sorry,

36
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,948
next chapter, okay?

37
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,753
You know the ridiculous irony
of this whole thing, Omar?

38
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,321
I was the one
with the addiction.

39
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,122
- Huh?
- My power trip.

40
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,624
I was high, 24-7,

41
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,864
being the master
of your recovery.

42
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,497
Power...

43
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,735
it's as evil a drug
as anything else.

44
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,643
You know, I would like you
to call me...

45
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,381
Kareem.

46
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,747
Kareem it is, then.

47
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,148
Thank you.

48
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,557
I must say, I think you're gonna be
nicely surprised by the variety show.

49
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,796
And... Omar White
is the grand finale.

50
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,029
- What, is he that good?
- I didn't say that.

51
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,562
I'm just...

52
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,973
I'm proudest of him
because he has really put

53
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,773
his heart and soul
into this.

54
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,269
As long as he goes through with it,
he will have succeeded.

55
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,976
How well he sings
doesn't matter.

56
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,479
Is there anything I can do
to help at this point?

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,988
As a matter of fact...

58
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,991
we need an emcee.

59
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,084
Forget about it.

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,527
- Aw.
- I'm not good at ducking rotten fruit.

61
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,995
You think I'm kidding?

62
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,831
The mob at the Coliseum
in Ancient Rome was kinder.

63
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,632
Why don't you try Mukada?
At least he's got God on his side.

64
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,502
You're such a chicken.

65
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,939
? Laughing in the sun?

66
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,738
? Always having fun?

67
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,768
? Doing all those things...?

68
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,904
What?

69
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,811
What the fuck
is that puberty shit?

70
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,544
Don't worry.
You're working out the kinks.

71
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,313
Okay.
Here we go.

72
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,921
Whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up.
I just need a minute, all right? Shit.

73
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,587
There ain't even nobody out there
and my fucking heart is pounding.

74
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,961
Omar, you are
doing fine.

75
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,625
The butterflies
are natural.

76
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,930
But fine means
I'm fucked.

77
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,560
Shit...

78
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,730
these motherfuckers
are gonna eat me for lunch,

79
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,002
motherfuckers!

80
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,943
I can just see them out there
trying to fucking jam me up and shit.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,871
Repeat after me.

82
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,408
Fuck.

83
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,180
- Huh?
- Fuck!

84
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,225
- Fuck.
- Them.

85
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,521
Say it.

86
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,461
Them.

87
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,622
Say it.

88
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,259
Fuck... them.

89
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,565
Very good, thank you
very much.

90
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,036
Okay, here we go.

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,269
Poet, can I talk
to you a second?

92
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,777
I need a little bit
of advice, man.

93
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,609
I be seeing you getting up there,
you know, in front of everybody

94
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,410
reciting your poetry, man.

95
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,781
- Yeah.
- Well, I got this talent show gig.

96
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,080
- Oh man.
- I'm bugging.

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,611
Here, sit down.
Poet got the answer.

98
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,122
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

99
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,091
I got the answer.

100
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,593
How you be gettin' up
on stage like that, you know?

101
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,121
Calm and cocky and shit
like you own the joint?

102
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,566
Easy.

103
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,662
Big old titty fuck in the green room
always do the trick.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,867
I can't hold that, man.

105
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,307
Why not?

106
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,640
Why not?

107
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,111
'Cause McManus and Said
say you can't?

108
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,973
Let me tell you
something, coz,

109
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,211
I already been down
that road with them two.

110
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,653
Said feeding me that bullshit
that I'm gonna be a symbol.

111
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,124
A phoenix, rising
on the wings of poetry

112
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,889
from the ashes of a crack-out?
Man, fuck that.

113
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,896
I'm just surviving
the war, yo.

114
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,491
And me getting up on stage,
kicking them rhymes,

115
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,002
that's me firing back.

116
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,027
And me juicing up
when I need to?

117
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,561
That's me treating
the wounds.

118
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,972
Just in case
you need the medicine,

119
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,348
we'll call that
an IOU.

120
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,414
Just in case,
all right?

121
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,185
Now remember
one thing...

122
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,488
everyone's eyes
will be on you.

123
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,003
My sister is so fat

124
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,742
that she turns around and we
give her a "welcome back" hug.

125
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,274
When she gets on an elevator,
it has to go down.

126
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,048
Okay, thanks,
you're beautiful.

127
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,590
Jesus, that's
a tough crowd.

128
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,355
Agamemnon Busmalis!

129
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,522
I would tell you
to imagine that they're all naked,

130
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,465
but, I guess you've already seen
a lot of them naked.

131
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,970
And finally, Omar White.

132
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,885
? I wanna be?

133
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,691
? Free...?

134
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,835
? Like the bluebirds?

135
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,806
? Flying by me?

136
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,570
? Like the waves?

137
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,545
? Out on the blue sea?

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,949
? If your love
has to tie me?

139
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:16,148
? Don't try me,
say goodbye?

140
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,220
? I wanna be?

141
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,696
? Free?

142
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,100
? Like the warm
September wind, babe?

143
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:35,096
? Say you'll always
be my friend, babe?

144
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,771
? We can make it
to the end, babe?

145
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,110
? Again, babe?

146
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,777
? I gotta say?

147
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,485
? I wanna be?

148
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,651
? Free.?

149
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,362
? I wanna be?

150
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,095
? Free.?

151
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,864
Omar, you suck!

152
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,067
? I wanna be?

153
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,770
? Free.?

154
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,030
- You're gloating.
- No, I'm not.

155
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,589
You are. You're waiting
for me to take back what I said,

156
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,728
that you always bet
on the impossible and lose.

157
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,761
Well, let me
get you started.

158
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,672
- I was wrong...
- Timmy, you are so cute.

159
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,472
- Wrong...
- Very few men would find vindication

160
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,206
in the prison version
of "Star Search."

161
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,737
Okay, I'm gloating.
But, you know, indulge me.

162
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,775
Omar White was a lost cause,
but I didn't give up on him.

163
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,844
I stayed by his side,
and you know what?

164
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,413
It's worth all the shit
that hasn't worked

165
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,449
to see one of them,
just one, pull through.

166
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,996
Still ironing
your own shirts, aren't you?

167
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,058
You know, I know
what you're thinking.

168
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,092
Tim loves
his lost causes.

169
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,402
I love when you read
my mind. Try again.

170
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,637
Oh, what's up, dude?

171
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,116
The poet got the cure.
The poet got the cure.

172
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,381
I took a rain check.

173
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,718
I ain't need that shit, coz.

174
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,882
I mean, I went close, man,
but then I said,

175
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,017
"Don't numb yourself.
Feel it. Yeah."

176
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,221
You fucking with me?
You fucking with me, right?

177
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,026
No, it's the tits
that's fucking with you.

178
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,026
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

179
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,510
Once again, with all due
respect, lmam,

180
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,311
we are concerned with who you
choose to spend your time with.

181
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,075
Am I close?

182
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,354
I thought so.

183
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,857
With all Omar White's
put you through in this

184
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,825
so-called sponsorship,

185
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,192
- now you two are buddy-buddy?
- Yes.

186
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,390
Because the alternative
is repugnant to me.

187
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,456
Meaning?

188
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,229
There's been
a largely unknown

189
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,429
but disgusting stain
upon our faith.

190
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:24,034
It's an issue that I have ignored
in my teachings to you.

191
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,239
Despite the Koran's
forbiddance of slavery,

192
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,271
there's an evil tradition
which continues

193
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,216
to this day.

194
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,584
Our Islamic brothers
of the north,

195
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,522
they capture our African brothers
of the south

196
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,582
all in the name
of Allah,

197
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,959
to Islamicize people
who look like you and me.

198
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,932
But we Muslims of America,
we'll turn a blind eye to that

199
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,197
because it doesn't fit
the neat little package

200
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,501
of white Christians
enslaving blacks.

201
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,138
I finally learned

202
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,343
that, in a sense,
I was capturing people to our faith...

203
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,213
to serve my own needs.

204
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,483
You consider your attempts
at conversion

205
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,049
- a form of enslavement?
- Yes, to the degree

206
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,424
that it has helped me
maintain my self-image.

207
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,056
Sometimes that degree
has been a significant degree.

208
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,300
Then there's Adebisi.

209
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,393
He was a black
African man

210
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,998
who mocked and defied
everything I wanted a black man to be.

211
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,742
The spirit of Adebisi
did not bleed into me.

212
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,609
That's voodoo.

213
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,308
That didn't make me
a violent man.

214
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,646
I am a violent man,

215
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,675
like anyone else.

216
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,017
Failing to win him over,

217
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,852
I got rid of him.

218
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,651
If we as blacks
and as Muslims

219
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,629
are truly gonna fight
for freedom...

220
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,169
Omar White should be allowed
to be who he is...

221
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,039
and I should be allowed
to be who I am.

222
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,869
So I thank Allah

223
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,811
for this so-called
sponsorship

224
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,044
that he has
put me through.

225
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,100
Prisoner #97R492:

226
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,335
James Robson:

227
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,072
Convicted November 7, 1997:

228
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,478
Murder in the first degree,

229
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,176
assault: Sentence: Life:

230
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,311
Up for parole
in 25 years.

231
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,918
- Not much of a meal there.
- Yeah, nothing cold or crunchy.

232
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,360
Why? You on a diet?

233
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,796
'Cause it hurts, dipshit.
Do I look fat to you?

234
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,000
God damn it!

235
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,270
Suddenly ice cream,
croutons...

236
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,935
it's like getting
your gums raked.

237
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,273
What the fuck is that?

238
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,802
They're probably recessive.

239
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,077
My old man
had bad gums.

240
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,318
When's the last time
you got a cleaning?

241
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,819
I don't know,
five or six years.

242
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,754
I hate
the fucking dentist.

243
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,485
Don't fuck around with your mouth.
My old man didn't deal,

244
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,390
his mouth ended up
a train wreck.

245
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,987
If I was you,
I'd see Dr. Faraj.

246
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,521
You don't wanna be slurping
turkey milkshakes in middle age.

247
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,396
Faraj?

248
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,062
I don't want some sand-nigger's
paws probing my mouth.

249
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,230
They wear gloves now,
you know,

250
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,263
since AIDS came along.

251
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,242
Oh.

252
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,211
Jesus, how long
has it really been?

253
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,180
Well, aside
from some cavities,

254
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,581
you can see that 10 and 11 show
significant recession in the gums...

255
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,086
- Meaning what?
- Meaning that surgery is recommended,

256
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,020
and I would say sooner
rather than later.

257
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,923
- What kind of fucking surgery?
- Well, you have two choices.

258
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,520
The conventional method is to take
tissue from the roof of your mouth

259
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,587
- and graft it to your gums.
- Shit.

260
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,099
- That sounds fucking painful.
- It is painful.

261
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,762
The alternative is
an acellular dermal graft,

262
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,295
where we use the gum tissue
from a cadaver.

263
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,174
You're kidding. Some dead person's
fucking gums in my mouth?

264
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,941
You can think of it
as an organ donation.

265
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,676
Sounds fucking creepy.

266
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,684
Well, the use
of your own fucking tissue

267
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,949
would require a longer and more
painful period of fucking recovery.

268
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,220
In the end, your fucking gums
would be healthy either fucking way.

269
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,850
Are you mocking me, Faraj?

270
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,690
Fuck no.

271
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,425
I don't like your Third-World
bullshit attitude.

272
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,562
And whatever
I decide, goonga,

273
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,503
I got a thing
about needles.

274
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,632
Any anesthesia, whatever,
I want gas first.

275
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,078
My pleasure, Sahib.

276
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,841
Oh, and one more thing...

277
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,905
being that I'm Aryan
and you're camelshit,

278
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,975
I'd appreciate it if you wore
two pairs of those plastic gloves.

279
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,987
You know, the less contact,
the better.

280
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,184
So, what do you think?

281
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,025
Well, it ain't a pretty set of options,
that's for sure.

282
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,531
No shit. Now you see
why I hate the dentist?

283
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,328
It's not their fault,
Robson.

284
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,427
You wait years between cleanings,
you never floss.

285
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,064
You brush your teeth
the way you scratch your scrotum.

286
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,539
I'm considering
the acellular thing.

287
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,510
All right,
which one's that?

288
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,376
It's like organ donation.

289
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,042
If I needed a liver,
the donor would be dead, right?

290
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,710
True, but you don't
need a liver.

291
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,218
We don't see
the liver.

292
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,483
Well, he said
it's like a small piece of tissue...

293
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,251
- All right, can we just...
- like right here.

294
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,123
- Talk about something else, please?
- Fuck it.

295
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,627
I'm going graveyard gums.

296
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,830
Holy shit.

297
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,200
Oh, hey, what's up, Doc?

298
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,172
Oh. Hey, how's
this stuff legal?

299
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,038
You know what kind
of killing you'd make

300
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,340
selling it to all
the drug-fiends in Oz?

301
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,369
I mean, they may have tits,
but you've got pussy.

302
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,211
What is it
with you Nazis and gas?

303
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,244
Oh, fuck you.

304
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,915
Hey, I thought I said
to wear two pairs of gloves.

305
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,151
- Open wide.
- No, let me have some more gas.

306
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,025
- I can feel it wearing off.
- You don't need more gas. Open wide.

307
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,586
You know, with all
your warped ideology,

308
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,393
I bet you never gave
much thought

309
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,559
to why Adolf was so
pissed off at the Jews.

310
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:27,504
One theory is that he was traumatized
by the death of his mother.

311
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,270
She died of breast cancer and she
was in the care of a Jewish physician,

312
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,938
so, of course,
the repressed hatred

313
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,311
erupted itself
into the Holocaust.

314
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,283
Now, another theory

315
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,719
is that Hitler's father

316
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,551
was the illegitimate son

317
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,888
of a German woman

318
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,223
and some obscure
Jewish man,

319
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,992
and so Hitler himself
had impure blood...

320
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,931
Hey, now, now

321
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,370
don't make me slip, because if I do,
we are both in trouble, hmm?

322
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,134
You know, it's amazing.
We don't even know

323
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,869
where these gums
come from.

324
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:09,477
I mean, this could be
the gums of a kike,

325
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,849
a spic,
or even a faggot.

326
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,981
You could be getting

327
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,014
the beautiful gums

328
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,084
of a big, black nigger.

329
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,923
? Free will?

330
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,161
? Can't seem to get
our fill?

331
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,069
? We are beggars,
we are losers?

332
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,868
? Drunk from lack
of power?

333
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,603
? I believe
in understanding?

334
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,373
? I've got to know
when we're landing?

335
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,539
? I'm taking
my survey now?

336
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,981
? Answer if you're
with me?

337
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,646
? If you want free will.?

338
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,288
Morning, gentlemen.

339
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,123
Check this out.

340
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,162
Fetch.

341
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,036
Come here, Chester.
Come here.

342
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,506
- He fetches.
- That's one thing to unlearn.

343
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,304
I told you, don't teach the dog
recreational activities.

344
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,211
- You brush your teeth with that?
- Today's focus is on control.

345
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,238
Start walking around
in this area.

346
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,892
- What the fuck was that?
- Scared the shit out of me.

347
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,986
I'm sorry, but your
reaction's not important.

348
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,657
The dog's is.
They have to maintain focus

349
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,429
even in the event
of loud or startling noises.

350
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,459
So what are you gonna do,
make them deaf?

351
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,063
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea:
Deaf dog, blind people.

352
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,404
- You're a fucking genius.
- You teach the dog

353
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,900
by standing on his leash
and saying "Chill."

354
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,072
- Chill?
- Chill.

355
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,184
Remember when I first started
I told you about

356
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,786
Officer Rivera,
you know,

357
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,821
what I'd done to him,
blinding him,

358
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,696
and how I just wanted
to do right?

359
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,134
- Yeah, you're doing that.
- Yeah,

360
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,364
but I just want
to do right by him direct.

361
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,737
I want Rivera
to have Julie.

362
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,935
Well, what's
the man's status?

363
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,671
I don't know.

364
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,770
I haven't heard from Eugene
in a long time.

365
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,179
Call him.
Have him come in.

366
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,242
We can talk, assess his want
and need of a guide-dog.

367
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,949
I'll try, but knowing how he feels
about this place, it's a long shot.

368
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,986
Eugene, Tina,
it's good to see you.

369
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,931
You... you're both
looking well.

370
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,900
I'll take your word
for that.

371
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,629
I'm Alicia Hinden.

372
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,103
I appreciate
your coming in.

373
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,299
Hello.

374
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,467
Did you read the literature
on the program?

375
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,033
Yes.

376
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,772
Sounds kind of interesting.

377
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,837
Yeah... if you've got
no other help.

378
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,281
Those dogs
are for lonely people.

379
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,807
Eugene has me.

380
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,617
Actually, a guide-dog
is not just for the person he's leading.

381
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,123
He helps the whole family
by freeing up your time.

382
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,592
I like helping
my husband.

383
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,255
Tina, you would be
helping your husband.

384
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,094
Oh yeah, like those interactions
with Alvarez did.

385
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,724
Look,
I'm skeptical too.

386
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,235
I worked here,
remember?

387
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,034
I can't believe these fucks
are capable of any good.

388
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,531
I mean, who teaches
these dogs?

389
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,841
Well, the one that...

390
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,642
we've got for you,

391
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,980
she was actually trained
by Miguel Alvarez.

392
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,816
- Are you fucking kidding?
- I knew that cabron was behind this.

393
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,755
- He's doing a wonderful job.
- Eugene, baby, please, let's go.

394
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,657
He's personally requested
we give Julie to you.

395
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:46,027
So, Eugene, if you like,
we can give her to you.

396
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,032
- I don't know.
- No!

397
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,091
No fucking way.
Eugene!

398
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,433
What, you're actually
considering this?

399
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,598
He probably trained
that mongrel to attack you.

400
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,504
No, I can assure you
that that is not...

401
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,600
Come on.
We're leaving.

402
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,840
The last thing we need
is favors from that motherfucker.

403
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,314
Mr. Rivera, please
think about it.

404
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,113
Jesus.

405
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,723
Good girl, Julie.

406
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,134
Prisoner #02M535:
Father Daniel Meehan:

407
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,735
Convicted
February 9th, 2002:

408
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,608
Destruction
of private property,

409
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,476
assault on an officer
of the law:

410
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:40,315
Sentence: 15 years:
Up for parole in five.

411
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,789
What are you in for, Pops?

412
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,265
It's Santa Claus.

413
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,791
Yeah, boy!

414
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,895
- He won't last a year.
- Don't break a hip.

415
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:15,819
- I'm on the bottom?
- You got that right.

416
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,685
There was
an O'Reily family

417
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,519
in my last parish,
St. Patrick's...

418
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,150
Well, it wasn't mine.

419
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,684
We only went to church
for funerals.

420
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,094
Oh, I see.

421
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,128
No.

422
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,635
You don't see dick.

423
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,729
Just 'cause I was
baptized a Catholic

424
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,070
doesn't mean I got any use
for a fuckin' priest.

425
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,371
Duly noted.

426
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,415
I've cleared
my schedule

427
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,620
so I can attend
Cyril's trial every day.

428
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,357
I'll be sitting right behind him
in the courtroom.

429
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,126
Mm-hmm.

430
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,532
Ryan, he's not gonna
get convicted.

431
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,695
He is not gonna get
the death penalty.

432
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,870
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

433
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,172
Hey. How you
feeling, kid?

434
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,576
- Scared.
- Don't be, okay?

435
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,478
Ma's gonna be with you
the whole way. All right?

436
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,416
Look, I brought you
a brand-new suit.

437
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,079
I hope it fits 'cause I wasn't
sure about the sizes.

438
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,987
Cyril, we're not allowed to travel
with you on the bus, okay?

439
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,718
So I'm taking Suzanne
in my car.

440
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,159
- We'll see you before the trial, okay?
- Okay.

441
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,161
You're gonna be okay.

442
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,859
- I wish you were coming.
- No, you don't need me.

443
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,633
You'll be fine.

444
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,934
But look, if you...

445
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,100
you know, if you start
to panic, all right,

446
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,235
I just want you
to think of me, okay?

447
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,576
All right.
Doing this...

448
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,808
Let's go. Let's go.

449
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,485
Hey, toss the ball.

450
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,087
Now toss
the fuckin' ball.

451
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,463
This is about the size
of your head, Morales.

452
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,867
You got style, Jia,
I'll give you that.

453
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,606
You had me fooled thinking that you were
worried about Li Chen hurting my ma.

454
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,546
You set me and Cyril up,

455
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,380
only... you thought
your boy would waste us,

456
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,249
not the other way around.

457
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,049
Zou Kai.

458
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,784
I got moves too,
brotherman.

459
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,180
Hey, Shupe. I see they let you out
of protective custody.

460
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,276
- Don't start anything, O'Reily.
- I ain't starting shit.

461
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,344
I'm just wondering
how much money

462
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,879
Jai Kenmin paid you to lie
about Cyril to the warden.

463
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,755
Look at me.

464
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,250
I'm gonna give you one chance
to switch your story to the truth.

465
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,696
- L... I told the truth.
- Okay.

466
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,233
Hey, I made
something special for you.

467
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,666
Eat up.

468
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,205
I'm not hungry.

469
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,175
I didn't think so.

470
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,848
- Glen Shupe.
- What about him?

471
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,219
I need that cocksucker
to have an accident.

472
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,248
- How severe?
- Not dead, just diminished.

473
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,419
And it can't be
traced back to me.

474
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,604
What do I get
in return?

475
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,232
Jia Kenmin dies,
and it can't be traced back to you.

476
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,174
Deal.

477
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,281
- Sean, I need the...
- Get out of the way!

478
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,553
Doctor,
I've got the arm.

479
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,756
I've got the arm.

480
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,927
The first day of trial
did not go well.

481
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,995
Judge Moore was in a foul mood,
and the prosecutor...

482
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,405
he's tough and smart.

483
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,433
So you're saying
we're gonna lose?

484
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,502
I just don't want
to give any false hopes.

485
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,606
During the jury selection,
Cyril got very agitated

486
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,116
and he kept talking
out loud,

487
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,209
and the judge kept
warning him to be silent.

488
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,743
Moore might eject him
from the courtroom.

489
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,222
Is the judge aware
of Cyril's mental state?

490
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,124
- Yeah, he just... he doesn't care.
- I'll talk to Cyril.

491
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,765
Hello, Cyril.

492
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,500
Hiya.

493
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,508
May I come in?

494
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,339
Sure.

495
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,971
How did it go today?

496
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,211
Lots of mumbo-jumbo.

497
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,887
"I object,"

498
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,382
"Motion to blah,
blah, blah."

499
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,693
Yeah. All those words
confused you, huh?

500
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,131
Everyone seems
so mean.

501
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,533
I was asking questions,

502
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,833
but the guy at the big desk
banged the thing

503
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,669
and yelled at me.

504
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,641
Ma was behind me,

505
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,303
but not close enough
to talk to.

506
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,912
I brought you something.

507
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,809
A puppet!

508
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,219
I want you to take this puppet
with you to court every day,

509
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,783
and when you feel the need
to talk to someone,

510
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,455
I want you
to whisper to him, okay?

511
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,724
Mm-hmm.

512
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,028
But I want you to whisper
to him very softly,

513
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,899
so no one else can hear you.
Show me.

514
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,636
- Sister Pete wants us to be...
- Even softer.

515
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,240
Excellent.

516
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,343
And at the end
of each day,

517
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,514
the two of you can tell me everything
you whispered to each other

518
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,491
and I'll explain
things to you, all right?

519
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,823
We have to give
the puppet a name.

520
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,829
Good. What do you want
to call him?

521
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,092
- Jericho.
- Why Jericho?

522
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,209
'Cause the walls
came tumbling down.

523
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,268
Lights out.

524
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,526
Jesus, you pray a lot.

525
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,802
Well, I need
a lot from my God:

526
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,776
Strength, guidance,
forgiveness.

527
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,678
While you're at it,
ask him to bring back conjugal visits.

528
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,445
- Don't you ever pray?
- No, not since grade school.

529
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,044
What happened?
Why'd you stop?

530
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,487
A priest tried to grope me
in the confessional.

531
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,218
Oh, I am sorry.

532
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,285
- Some priests get lost spiritually...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

533
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,592
Father,
give it a rest.

534
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,565
I was just kidding.

535
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,529
Look, I have
a meeting tomorrow

536
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,235
with Father Mukada
and I was thinking...

537
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,506
Lights out means
shut the fuck up.

538
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,616
? Hey, lookie yonder,
tell me what you see?

539
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:14,064
? Marching to the fields
of Vietnam?

540
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:18,091
? Looks like Handsome Johnny
with an M-16?

541
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,105
? Marching
to the Vietnam War?

542
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,768
? Yeah, marching to
the Vietnam War?

543
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,477
? Hey, lookie yonder,
now tell me what you see?

544
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,847
? Marching to
the Birmingham Fields?

545
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:37,116
? Looks like Handsome Johnny
with his hand rolled in a fist?

546
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,386
? Marching to
the Birmingham Wars?

547
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:44,020
? Yeah, marching
to the Birmingham Wars?

548
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:49,031
? And it's
a long, hard road?

549
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:53,128
? It's a long,
hard road?

550
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,334
? It's a long,
hard road?

551
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:00,743
? Hey, before
we'll be free?

552
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:04,942
? Hey, before
we'll be free...?

553
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,482
? Huh!?

554
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,419
? Huh!?

555
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,786
Any word on
Augustus's condition?

556
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,158
Well, I got a call in to Dr. Panitz
at Benchley Memorial.

557
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,026
When he calls me,
I'll let you know.

558
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,793
- What about you? You got news for me?
- Not yet.

559
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,199
- You find out who gave Hill the drugs?
- Not yet.

560
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,362
Well, when you do,
you let me handle the rest.

561
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,565
Of course, McManus.

562
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,540
- Of course.
- Hey... hey.

563
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,543
You gave me your word.

564
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,578
And my word is
my bond, hmm?

565
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,317
Count!
Let's go! Move it!

566
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,331
Yo, Burr,
I'm telling you,

567
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,459
it must have been
them Sicilians

568
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,732
that gave Augustus
them drugs.

569
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,103
They mad 'cause
you and Morales

570
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,040
is muscling them
out of the tit game.

571
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,737
- You get me some proof.
- Proof?

572
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,212
Man, proof is hard
to come by, yo.

573
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,408
I need to see
some proof.

574
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,746
Shit.

575
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,053
- Hey, yo, Chico, my man.
- What do you want?

576
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,289
Yo, we got
a problem, man.

577
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,889
Burr thinks that you gave Hill the juice that
sent him into hyperspace,

578
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,264
and he growling
for revenge.

579
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,064
- Me?
- Yeah.

580
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,435
No, man. Yo, the Sicilians
probably did it.

581
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,600
I tried to tell him, but you
know Burr, man. He want confirmation.

582
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,406
So I got a solution.

583
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,572
You got to find somebody

584
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,912
who will say that they saw
the dagos give Hill the shit.

585
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,885
- Who?
- I don't know who, man,

586
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,616
somebody with no... no...
what you call it?

587
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,715
No... no vested interest.

588
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,282
Excuse me.

589
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,462
What?

590
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,629
What?

591
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,400
Salvatore Desanto.

592
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,770
Mmm.

593
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,798
He gave the drugs
to Augustus.

594
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,572
Yeah,

595
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,169
l... I saw
the whole thing.

596
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,477
- Okay.
- All right.

597
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,482
See, I told you.

598
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,785
At dinner tonight,
I want you to do me a little favor

599
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,384
and stick this
in Desanto's food for me.

600
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,420
- What's this?
- A mind fuck.

601
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,698
I say we whack Redding.

602
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,603
We... we tried
killing Redding.

603
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,504
He don't fuckin' die.

604
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,305
That is bullshit, Sal.
Anybody can fuckin' die.

605
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,278
Fuck.

606
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,472
Fuck,
what's goin' on?

607
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,313
Jesus, what's happening?

608
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,184
My... my head is...

609
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,527
- Shit.
- What the fuck?

610
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,690
Salvatore Desanto is brain-dead,
overdose of LSD.

611
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,292
Oh, man,
that's a bummer.

612
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,667
I saw a lot of acid myself
over in Vietnam.

613
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,797
That stuff's more
lethal than the Viet Cong.

614
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,535
It really can
blow your mind.

615
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,475
Yeah.
You know,

616
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,343
I really should have the food
that Desanto was eating tested.

617
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,905
Now that's
a good idea.

618
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,247
Only problem is
ain't no food left.

619
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,776
My boys, they...
they ain't so good at cooking,

620
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,845
but when it comes to the end
of the day, man,

621
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,119
they clean up that cafeteria,
I'm telling you.

622
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,854
- I'll bet.
- Mmm, spotless.

623
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,692
The first time that
I got raped by Adebisi,

624
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,726
I thought, "This was the worst thing
that could ever happen."

625
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,673
But... I was wrong.

626
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,608
How many men
were there?

627
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,538
Three.

628
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,514
Do you know
why they did it?

629
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,539
Does the why matter?

630
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,484
Only to you.

631
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,350
What do you want me
to say, Sister?

632
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,448
Peter, I don't want you
to say anything.

633
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,982
I just want you
to understand

634
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,554
that no matter what you think you may
have done to bring this on yourself,

635
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,158
you did not deserve
to be raped.

636
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,659
Those men,
whoever they are,

637
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,763
had no right
to violate you.

638
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,274
Ah, all right.

639
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,775
Tomorrow.
Same time?

640
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,972
No.

641
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,073
I don't think any of this
is really helping me, Sister.

642
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,175
Peter...

643
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,345
Thanks.
Thanks for trying.

644
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,756
I want to find the three men
who raped Schibetta.

645
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,421
Why?

646
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,158
Why, Leo?

647
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,927
Why?

648
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,991
Look, we're doing
everything we can

649
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,299
to keep the number
of reported rapes down.

650
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,204
Reported?
Listen to you.

651
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,901
Your own daughter
was raped.

652
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,006
This is different.
This is Oz.

653
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,416
- Rape is rape, Leo.
- I don't agree.

654
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,784
Here, rape has a...
a leveling effect.

655
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:14,154
Peter Schibetta,
from the day he arrived,

656
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,490
wanted to be a tough guy, wanted
to follow in his father's footsteps,

657
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,496
running things,
hurting people.

658
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,691
Well, he got
stopped by Adebisi.

659
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,792
- Now he got stopped again.
- What's going on?

660
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,360
Do you have something personal
against Schibetta?

661
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,804
No, no.

662
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,466
It's simply...

663
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,703
survival
of the fittest,

664
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,870
as natural and basic
as Darwin.

665
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,780
You and I have disagreed about a lot over
the years, but this is...

666
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,408
Peter Marie...

667
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,248
"A leveling effect"?

668
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,722
You want rape
to do your job?

669
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,590
You see this medal?
St. Dismas.

670
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,824
He's the patron saint
of prisoners.

671
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,134
Al Capone gave this to my grandfather
in the '20s.

672
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,404
- I didn't know Al Capone was religious.
- He wasn't.

673
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,274
He just liked
to hedge his bets.

674
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,609
Dr. Nathan,

675
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,444
I keep feeling
worse and worse.

676
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,678
I know.

677
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,382
I haven't prayed
since the fifth grade.

678
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,284
I've forgotten how.

679
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,020
Me too.

680
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,163
Hola.

681
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,138
- Hola yourself.
- Well, you're in a mood.

682
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,538
Oh, I am frustrated.

683
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,600
I'm dealing
with Peter Schibetta

684
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,373
and taking
these little baby steps,

685
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,541
and then this morning he tells me
he's done with therapy.

686
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,711
Maybe you should have him talk
to some other guy who's been raped.

687
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,778
Yeah, yeah, I was
thinking about that.

688
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:55,121
Listen, are you aware of any trouble
between Leo and Peter?

689
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,093
No. Why?

690
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,289
Never mind.

691
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:03,061
I'm just having one of those days
filled with massive confusion.

692
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,625
I'm having
a day myself.

693
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,263
Chucky Pancamo came in
with a stab wound

694
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,773
- and caught a staph infection.
- Oh.

695
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,333
Yeah, he's sinking
pretty fast.

696
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,538
And you're
blaming yourself.

697
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,979
His wound got infected
on my watch.

698
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,006
Life is dangerous
enough in Oz

699
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,348
without prisoners having
to worry about dying

700
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,377
due to poor
medical treatment.

701
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,022
Look at us.

702
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:30,049
We're complete
and utter failures at our jobs.

703
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,857
So what do we do
instead?

704
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,831
Form an all-girl band?

705
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,265
- Hey, I want to ask you a favor.
- Sure.

706
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,129
I want you to talk
to Peter Schibetta.

707
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,010
Okay.

708
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,711
Only if...

709
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,739
you teach Chucky Pancamo
how to pray.

710
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,279
Peter.

711
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,451
Come in.

712
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,262
Oh, sit down.

713
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,941
May I take your hand?

714
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,482
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

715
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,645
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

716
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,178
And blessed is
the fruit of thy womb...

717
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,021
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb...

718
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,254
- Jesus.
- Jesus.

719
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,558
Holy Mary,
mother of God...

720
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,122
Holy Mary,
mother of God...

721
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,158
- pray for us sinners...
- pray for us sinners...

722
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,762
now and at the hour
of our death.

723
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,365
Now and at the hour
of our death.

724
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,967
Amen.

725
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:03,312
? Look, I'm standing
naked before you?

726
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:08,348
? Don't you want
more than my sex??

727
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:14,194
? I can scream as loud
as your last one?

728
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:19,635
? But I can't claim
innocence?

729
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:25,233
? Oh, God, could it be
the weather??

730
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:30,407
? Oh, God,
why am I here??

731
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:35,350
? If love isn't forever?

732
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,378
? And it's not
the weather?

733
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:42,153
? Hand me my leather.?

734
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,752
Hoyt.

735
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:51,190
Oh, it's nice
to see you, Father.

736
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,533
- Really?
- It's nice to see anyone.

737
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,937
This fuckin' place
is spooky.

738
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,539
Jaz, you confessed to several murders,
including Jim Burns.

739
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,979
But you didn't act alone.
You had help.

740
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,743
I ain't rattin'
on my friends.

741
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,774
No, no, no,
not all of them,

742
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,080
but Timmy Kirk...

743
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,144
- I killed Timmy Kirk.
- No.

744
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,656
As hard as you tried,
he survived.

745
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,123
- He's back at Oz.
- Cocksucker!

746
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,595
You tell the warden
the truth about Kirk,

747
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,121
and he's gonna be
moving in right next door.

748
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,695
Get me Glynn.

749
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,363
I want to sing.

750
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,103
It's Hoyt's version
versus mine.

751
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:38,171
He killed Burns.
He bricked Cloutier inside a wall.

752
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,877
This is all some kind of weird
revenge thing on his part.

753
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,443
- I'm innocent.
- You liar!

754
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,579
Ray. Ray.

755
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,613
You will burn, Kirk!

756
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:47,988
Take Kirk
back to Unit B.

757
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,424
You're the one
who will burn.

758
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,571
Hey, Clarence,

759
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,470
- how are you?
- Good.

760
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,338
Ooh, you been
working out?

761
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,843
- Yeah.
- Yeah? I can tell.

762
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,970
Hey, you're in
for arson, right?

763
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,038
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

764
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,605
You know
any other arsonists?

765
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,844
I mean,
on the outside.

766
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,374
One or two.

767
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,910
How'd you like
a blowjob?

768
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,719
Hmm?

769
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,784
Our Lady of Fatima Church
and its rectory next door

770
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,728
burned to the ground this evening,
killing two priests.

771
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,824
The two priests, Father John Downing
and Father Jack Hurlbert,

772
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,495
were trapped on an upper floor
of the rectory.

773
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,436
Also injured
was Father Raymond Mukada,

774
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,099
- who suffered from smoke inhalation...
- Holy shit!

775
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,167
And is in serious condition
at Benchley Memorial Hospital.

776
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,178
Arson is suspected
as the cause.

777
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,792
? You creep?

778
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,992
? Into my heart?

779
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:07,231
? And make my heart?

780
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,136
? Burn!?

781
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,904
? You sneak?

782
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,674
? Into my mind?

783
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:21,913
? And make my head?

784
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,920
? Ache!?

785
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:32,254
? Look, it's time
to face the music?

786
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,788
? Bye-bye!?

787
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,427
? Don't slam
the door?

788
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,098
? This is the last duet?

789
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,540
? Last chance
you're gonna get?

790
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,637
? No more harmony?

791
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,581
? For you and me?

792
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:58,179
? This is the last duet?

793
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,953
- ? I'll ever do with?
- ? Never do with?

794
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,789
? Never ever?

795
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,388
? Never ever,
never do with you.?

796
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,906
Sir, may I speak?

797
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,205
Sure, prag.

798
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,508
Uh, what's the latest
on Adam Guenzel?

799
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,014
And how's your
plan working?

800
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,074
Well, I predict

801
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,246
by the end of the week

802
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,257
he'll be sucking my cock.

803
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,561
Yesterday I deposed
Jerry Heekin.

804
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,495
Who's that?

805
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:47,231
He's that man who claims he saw you
dump Brice Tibbetts in the field.

806
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,899
He's a very
credible witness.

807
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,239
- Is that so?
- Remember you said that he testified

808
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,871
it was late
at night, so...

809
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,381
it must have been dark,
no lights in the field?

810
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,679
Yeah, well, see,
he had a flashlight.

811
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,878
He saw you...

812
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,548
- clearly.
- It wasn't me.

813
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,557
Look.

814
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,116
A lot of guys running around
look like me, you know.

815
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,526
I got a very
familiar face.

816
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,923
- You know, I'm divorced.
- Mmm.

817
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,197
Yeah.

818
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,136
I was married to Eddie
for 10 years.

819
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,901
One day I asked him where he'd been,
he goes, "Barney's,"

820
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,136
just so fast,
so convincingly,

821
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,145
I knew immediately
he was lying.

822
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,680
Are you calling me
a liar?

823
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,446
Every person in this country
deserves a fair trial,

824
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,316
deserves a good lawyer.

825
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,413
I cannot be
that lawyer for you.

826
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,286
I'll call the Public Defender's
office and find you someone else.

827
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,262
Catherine,
wait a minute.

828
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,526
I need you.

829
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,830
Keller, this is the one time
where your charms are useless.

830
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,064
Catherine...
Catherine!

831
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,572
Catherine!

832
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,969
Toby.

833
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,603
Hey.

834
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,882
Look, I just... I wanted
to let you know

835
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,511
that I won't be representing
Keller anymore.

836
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,884
Why?
What happened?

837
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,616
He's guilty.

838
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,454
You know, I made a promise
to myself the day I passed the bar.

839
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,858
I said I was never gonna
represent a guilty person,

840
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,954
and I'm not gonna start now,
not even for you.

841
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,555
I understand.

842
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,567
Answer me this.

843
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,974
When I'd asked you if he had ever
discussed these murders, you said no.

844
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,604
Yeah.

845
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,910
I lied.

846
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,678
Keller says so many things,
who knows what's true?

847
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,844
But you believe him
when he says he loves you.

848
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,751
Yes.

849
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,518
You do belong together.

850
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,956
Catherine.

851
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,360
Loves makes us all
do strange things.

852
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,059
You don't have
to tell me that.

853
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,065
You have a good life.

854
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,776
You knew
the woman you raped?

855
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,541
We used to date.

856
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,514
We bumped
into each other at this bar,

857
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,574
did some K,
started making out.

858
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,779
Next thing I knew,
Franklin and me

859
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,755
had her in the park,
face down in the grass.

860
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,317
You know, I never raped
a woman I knew.

861
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,453
- Adam?
- Yeah?

862
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,258
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

863
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,527
Two seconds.

864
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,464
Lovebirds.

865
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,802
You shouldn't be
hanging out with those guys.

866
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,900
Instead I should be playing
backgammon with you and Busmalis?

867
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,434
The bikers are
Schillinger's allies.

868
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,880
They're just being friendly
with you to try and set you up.

869
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,816
Schillinger wants you.

870
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,877
You ought to know, right,
having been his prag.

871
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,857
Hey, Guenzel,
you and Beecher goin' on a date?

872
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,859
While you're down there,
suck this cock, you faggot.

873
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,094
- Cocksucker.
- Ride him, cowboy.

874
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,603
A goal, goal,
goal, goal.

875
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,536
- That's my man!
- All right.

876
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,739
Schillinger.

877
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,948
You made me an offer the other day
that you'd help me get to see Keller

878
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,852
if I gave you
the boy Guenzel.

879
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,288
Yeah.

880
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,985
Is the offer
still on the table?

881
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,094
Jeez, I don't know.

882
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,191
I'll quit Sister Pete. I'll come
to work for you in the mailroom.

883
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,725
I'll call
the Sicilians off.

884
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,064
Please.

885
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,235
Oh, okay.

886
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,049
I no longer want you
to protect Adam Guenzel.

887
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,813
After I seen what he did to you,
I ain't surprised.

888
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,411
The kid's a prick.

889
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,493
- Sister.
- Good morning.

890
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,089
There is something
I've got to talk to you about.

891
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,861
I've decided to quit
working for you.

892
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,262
- What?
- Well, you know,

893
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,137
I've been doing the same job
for five years and I'm...

894
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,903
bored.

895
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,078
You know, l...

896
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,581
I had no idea
you were unhappy.

897
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,242
Well, I'm...
I'm not unhappy.

898
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,775
- If there's...
- I'm not unhappy.

899
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,379
Yeah.
Oh, well, all right.

900
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,083
If you're s...
sure about this.

901
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,058
I am.

902
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,561
Okay.

903
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,460
When do you
want to leave?

904
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,021
Today.

905
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,194
Today?

906
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,466
So you want to go
work with the Aryans?

907
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,973
Uh-huh. Ever since
we started these interactions,

908
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,567
Schillinger and I have been
getting along real well.

909
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,078
Plus working in the mailroom
allows you to see Keller.

910
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,775
It's okay, Beecher,
because I agree with Sister Pete.

911
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,510
You should be
allowed visits.

912
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,916
Yeah, but the real problem
is Adam Guenzel.

913
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,786
I know you're gonna do
whatever you think is best,

914
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,916
but Adam and I just
haven't been getting along.

915
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,125
I think
maybe you were right

916
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,630
when you said you wanted
to transfer him out of Em City.

917
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,963
Well, he's disruptive. I thought
you being friends was gonna help, but...

918
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,663
Me too.
It hasn't worked out.

919
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,298
Okay. I'm gonna ship him
over to Unit B.

920
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,933
- Schillinger.
- Yeah?

921
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,639
The boy is all yours.

922
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,213
Time for you
to deliver the mail.

923
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,389
Hey there, tough guy.

924
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,189
Knock knock.

925
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,488
Keller.

926
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,523
Go away.
I don't want to play today.

927
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,125
Huh?

928
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,398
I don't wanna
fuck right now.

929
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,702
Maybe you're forgetting
who's who here.

930
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,470
You're my bitch,

931
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,069
not the other way around.

932
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,637
I've been bringing you
little extras

933
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,876
and in return,

934
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:10,375
you've been giving me
little extras.

935
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,619
Don't poke me.

936
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,960
Fucking cunt, I don't want to see
your ugly fuckin' face...

937
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,023
God damn it!

938
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,269
Central, we got a 16,
section 32.

939
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,273
- How the mighty have fallen.
- Fuck you, faggot.

940
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,475
- Guenzel.
- Hey, Vern.

941
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,780
- The boys in Em City send their regards. - 
Shut up.

942
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,116
Hey, I was just...
God, what the fuck was...?

943
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,282
- You'll speak when you're spoken to.
- Hey, get the fuck off me!

944
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:51,226
- Get off of me!
- Sir... sir, may I watch?

945
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,059
Well, if you don't, how are you
ever gonna learn?

946
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,190
Help!
Get the fuck off me!

947
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,894
Get the fuck off!

948
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,619
- I've got mail for Keller.
- He's not here.

949
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,021
- Where is he?
- Benchley Memorial.

950
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,329
In the hospital?
Well, what happened?

951
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,803
He acted up.
I shut him down.

952
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,203
Keep moving,
Beecher.

953
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,478
? On days like these?

954
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,578
? When the rain
won't fall?

955
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,021
? And the sky is so dry?

956
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:57,493
? That even birds
can't call?

957
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,519
? I can feel your tears?

958
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:03,896
? Disappearing in the air?

959
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,866
? Carried on the breeze?

960
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,808
? On days like these?

961
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,978
? But you can't reap?

962
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,143
? What you don't sow?

963
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,380
? And you can't plant?

964
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,323
? In hollow ground?

965
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,485
? So let us fill?

966
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:35,328
? This empty earth
with hope?

967
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:39,096
? Until the rains
come down?

968
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:44,300
? On days like these.?
