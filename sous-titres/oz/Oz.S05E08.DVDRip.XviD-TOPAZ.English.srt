1
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,423
Here are some scary facts
about impotence:

2
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,367
10 to 20 million Americans
suffer from it,

3
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,996
85% due to physical causes

4
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,097
not related to the penis:

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,234
10% suffer because
of psychological reasons:

6
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,541
And scariest of all, for 5%
of the men who are impotent,

7
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,071
the cause is unknown.

8
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,725
Hey.

9
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,667
Jesus.

10
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,969
Don't do this
to me, Vern.

11
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,237
You guys are
all I got in here.

12
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,045
It's not my choice,
James.

13
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,878
We've got a charter
we gotta follow.

14
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,009
You know that charter
better than anybody.

15
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,381
I asked the fuckin' dentist.

16
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,514
He said he put white man's
gums in my mouth.

17
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,388
- White.
- Really?

18
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,451
'Cause that bruise Dr. Faraj
planted on your cheek is blue.

19
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,692
That tells me you didn't get
the answer you were looking for.

20
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,895
Tomorrow you're moving
to another cell.

21
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,570
There's Robson.
You were right, lmam.

22
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,672
Allah has punished him
for his sins.

23
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,081
- How's the mouth?
- Arif.

24
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,214
Fuck you.

25
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,792
Robson.

26
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,196
Despite all you done,
my heart goes out to you.

27
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,225
God is trying
to teach you something.

28
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,099
Please be smart
enough to learn.

29
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,700
Yeah.

30
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,577
He's saying my friends
will take me back.

31
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,141
I'll make them
take me back.

32
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,154
Oh, lookie here,
my step-brother.

33
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,593
Feels good talking
with a black man's gums, don't it?

34
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,494
I need a shitload
of tits, now.

35
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,694
You? All that Aryan drug-free bullshit
just bullshit, ain't it?

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,261
Will you shut your fucking
corn-trap and hook me?

37
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,206
- Or I can take my cash elsewhere.
- All right, man.

38
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,280
Shit! Guard! Officer!

39
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,791
One of the physical causes
of impotence

40
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,387
is lack of frequent
spontaneous erections.

41
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,694
In other words,

42
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,700
you can't get it up...

43
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,769
because you
don't get it up.

44
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,635
Because you can't
get it up,

45
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,335
because you
don't get it up...

46
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,876
either way,
you're fucked.

47
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,138
I can't get it up.

48
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,742
Miguel Alvarez
is up for parole again.

49
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,653
So what? He'll just get rejected,
same as last time.

50
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,589
Maybe not.

51
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,558
Tim, come on.

52
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,755
With all the shit he's pulled,
the board's not gonna let him go free.

53
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,627
Well, Alvarez
is a changed man.

54
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,822
He's really trying
to stay out of trouble.

55
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,666
Bullshit. Look, I know he did a good job
training the seeing-eye dog,

56
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,935
but one pooch hardly balances
out his criminal record.

57
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:45,069
Well... I'm writing a letter
to the board recommending parole.

58
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,241
Alicia Hinden, who ran the program,
is gonna do the same thing.

59
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,910
And if Ray Mukada were here,
he would too.

60
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,284
Tim, do you honestly
believe Miguel Alvarez

61
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,879
is ready to rejoin society?

62
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,982
Six months ago
the dink was in solitary

63
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,652
smearing shit
on his cell wall.

64
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,423
I know there's been bad blood
between you and Alvarez

65
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,055
almost since
the day he arrived.

66
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,760
What are you saying,
my judgment is clouded? Fuck you.

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,701
- Have you spoken to him since?
- No!

68
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,001
- Don't you think you owe him that?
- Owe him?

69
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,507
Not warden to prisoner,
man to man.

70
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,304
If a person's
trying to change,

71
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,971
- shouldn't we acknowledge that?
- Not in Alvarez's case.

72
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,980
- Leo...
- No, damn it, no, hell, no!

73
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,074
You file your fuckin' letters
of recommendation, okay?

74
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,246
I'll call Steve Dawkins myself
and put an end to this bullshit.

75
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,656
Thanks for setting up
the parole hearing, McManus.

76
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,558
To tell you
the truth, Miguel,

77
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,995
these parole board
hearings...

78
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,897
your chances for release
are a long shot.

79
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,867
No, no, no, no.
I got a good feeling.

80
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,427
I got a good feeling.
I got my "A" game on.

81
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,032
God, it'd be great just to get away
from Oz, you know?

82
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,805
I could see Maritza.
She's been let out of Parker Women's.

83
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,803
She's got a job. You know,
she's got her life on course.

84
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,874
Shit, maybe I can have
another baby, you know?

85
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,909
I just gotta let
the parole board people

86
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,081
understand that I can do that
too, you know?

87
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,250
That I know in my heart
that I'm ready.

88
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,104
It's a pleasure to meet you guys,
you know.

89
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,538
Yeah, my... dad

90
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,049
and my... grandfather

91
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,017
were both
incarcerated in here.

92
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,385
- Excuse me?
- Alvarez, what are you doing?

93
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:40,791
I'm just practicing my answers
for the parole board hearing.

94
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,226
Count!

95
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,931
- Hey!
- Hey, pretty boy, man!

96
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,470
Hey, Charlie Brown.

97
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,075
Maritza.

98
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,818
Maritza.

99
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,791
Maritza, mi amor.

100
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,755
- Fuck you.
- Ooh, careful, Miguel.

101
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,960
You wouldn't want a smudge
on that record this late in your parole.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,661
Shut the fuck up!

103
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,232
You know what would be
a terrible tragedy?

104
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,803
Just before you got out,
if Maritza...

105
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,609
has some kind
of accident.

106
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,385
You hurt her...

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,048
you're dead.

108
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,253
You fuck with my parole,
you're dead.

109
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:51,730
Oh, you're so fuckin' beautiful
when you're angry.

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,231
All right, Mr. Alvarez, that was
a very lovely speech you just made.

111
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,329
But now we'd like
to ask you some questions.

112
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,966
Mr. Dawkins, you can
ask me whatever you want.

113
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,273
You were convicted
of beating a 75-year-old man,

114
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,280
then cutting his face,
all because his car scraped yours.

115
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,839
Yeah, I wasn't
myself that day.

116
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,579
Once you were here in Oswald,
you cut your own face

117
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,110
and later tried to hang yourself
in your cell.

118
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,749
Were you yourself
either of those days?

119
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,090
Last year you masterminded
an escape from Oswald.

120
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,619
I didn't mastermind
an escape.

121
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,656
Busmalis was digging a tunnel
and I was fearing for my life...

122
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,668
You were one of the major
leaders in the riot

123
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,500
and hurt a number of people,
including an officer, Joseph Mineo.

124
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,096
He was making
a move on me...

125
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,634
Later, you poked out the eyes
of another officer, Eugene Rivera.

126
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,703
Then you murdered
two fellow prisoners,

127
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,907
Carlo Ricardo
and a Jorge Vasquez.

128
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,645
So, my question is,

129
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,983
what the fuck
makes you think

130
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,648
we should set you free,
you little prick?

131
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,292
Knock it off!

132
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,026
Knock it off!

133
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,330
Let him go, Alvarez!

134
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,359
Fuck!

135
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,304
This is fuckin' bullshit!
I'm fuckin' tellin' them...

136
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,570
I'm trying to tell them
how I got rehabilitated.

137
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,474
Fuckin' bullshit!

138
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,707
He asked me how I think
I changed in all this bullshit.

139
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,272
I'm talking to him and I'm
trying to explain how I changed.

140
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,910
- Are you listening to me?
- I gotta talk to you about my trial.

141
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,147
He fuckin' cuts me off.
He just cuts me off.

142
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,214
- I'm lonely. I'm afraid!
- Are you listening to me?

143
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:29,159
Montgomery is a cunt
that got what he deserved. Cunt!

144
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,961
Hey, that C.O. Had no right to shove
my face in shit. Get me out of here.

145
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,523
Get me the fuck
out of here!

146
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,592
- I'm afraid.
- Cunt!

147
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,002
Get me the fuck
out of here.

148
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,165
McManus!

149
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,958
It's quittin' time.

150
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,587
You promised
to buy me a drink.

151
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,530
I really need
that fuckin' drink.

152
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,432
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to pass.

153
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,302
- I don't want to leave Pancamo.
- You know...

154
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,568
I've been dumped by a lot
of women for a lot of guys,

155
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,911
- but never one in a coma.
- He could die, Tim.

156
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,506
It's my fault.

157
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,747
A man comes into my E.R.
With a non-life-threatening stab wound,

158
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,687
gets infected
and goes into toxic shock.

159
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,553
I didn't take proper care
of him before

160
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,888
but I sure as hell am not
gonna let him die alone.

161
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,589
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Okay.

162
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,099
There you go.

163
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,606
You ever met
my wife...

164
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,012
my ex-wife,
Eleanor O'Connor?

165
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,982
Our paths
have yet to cross.

166
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,850
We've been divorced
five years.

167
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,753
When I was first offered
the job at Oswald

168
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,122
to build Em City,
to fulfill a lifelong dream,

169
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,093
she didn't want
to trail along.

170
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,359
She had this great job,
she didn't want to leave, so...

171
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,890
I just walked out,
and for five years

172
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,460
I've carried
the guilt of that.

173
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,199
I mean, every time
something goes haywire,

174
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,369
I just think,
you know, "Fuck.

175
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,006
I could be with Ellie
and maybe by now

176
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,481
we'd have
a couple of kids."

177
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,076
Don't talk to me about regret.
I own the patent.

178
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,280
Well, my point is...

179
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,586
today I was
walking in solitary

180
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:42,287
and I was surrounded
by all my mistakes,

181
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,558
and my head
was gonna explode.

182
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,623
But then I thought
about Omar White,

183
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,432
about how hard it was
to turn him around.

184
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,802
But we did it.

185
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,275
I mean, we can't
save them all, Gloria,

186
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,437
but if we can
save just one,

187
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,743
that's enough.

188
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,019
And I want
to save Pancamo.

189
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,281
Well...

190
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,452
thanks for the coffee.

191
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,894
Now, I'm gonna
get myself a real drink.

192
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,591
Good night.

193
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,835
- I'm gonna snap the faggot's head off!
- Take his head off!

194
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,344
Prisoner #02C773:

195
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,346
Wolfgang Cutler:
Convicted February 20th, 2002:

196
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,120
Murder
in the first degree:

197
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,289
Sentence: Life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.

198
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,230
I want into
the Brotherhood.

199
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,138
You know the deal,
Wolfgang.

200
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,608
You gotta demonstrate
your fearlessness.

201
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,874
By whacking somebody?
Who?

202
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,246
Killing a nigger's
always nice.

203
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,773
The higher up the better.

204
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,786
Kareem Said.

205
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,189
I like the way
you think.

206
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,398
- Omar, you ready for some hot gossip?
- Hmm?

207
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,334
I overheard the Aryans
in the gym.

208
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,064
That new guy
Wolfgang Cutler,

209
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,731
he was bragging
to the others

210
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,535
about how he was
gonna kill Said.

211
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,244
Yo, you Cutler?

212
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,309
How the fuck
did you get back here?

213
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,980
That don't matter.

214
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:53,355
Look, I came because I heard
a rumor and shit, all right?

215
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,360
Just stay away
from Said, all right?

216
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,192
No, no, whatever you got brewing,
just stop it, okay?

217
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,664
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

218
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,166
And get the fuck
out of here.

219
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,396
I'm trying to be
diplomatic here, okay?

220
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,700
And I'm telling you,
get the fuck out of here!

221
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,502
Look, I've been
pretty good lately.

222
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,337
You don't want
to see me bad, okay?

223
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,812
- You touch Said...
- And what?

224
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,576
Nigger,
you gonna cry?

225
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,344
Fuck you!

226
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,874
Hey...

227
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,615
- Motherfucker, motherfucker.
- Fuck.

228
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,525
- Motherfucker.
- Fuck you.

229
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,428
Stay away.
Stay away.

230
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,932
You motherfucker,
I'm going to fuck...

231
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,198
I'll kill you,
fuckin' black motherfucker.

232
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm telling you,
don't touch Said!

233
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,167
Stay away!

234
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,732
Stay the fuck away
from Said!

235
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,213
Stay the fuck away.

236
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,841
Stay, stay the fuck...

237
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,483
Oh shit, what's that?

238
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,920
What's that, Cutler?
Cutler?

239
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,516
Cutler...

240
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,527
Hey, hey.

241
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,794
Come on, man.
Hey, Cutler.

242
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,426
Cutler!

243
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,130
Come on, man,
don't do this to me.

244
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,867
Don't fuckin' die.
Oh, shit!

245
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,465
Fuck!

246
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,882
Oh, shit, fuck.

247
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,886
Fuck! I almost
killed the motherfucker!

248
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,292
I mean, look, it's not
like I started anything!

249
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,455
The motherfucker was
all up in my shit, man...

250
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,863
taunting me! I don't know
what the fuck happened!

251
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,060
Omar, slow down.
Who are you talking about?

252
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,593
- Cutler's getting ready to jack you!
- Wolfgang Cutler.

253
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,628
The motherfucker's
still alive, okay?

254
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,698
In a second, the hacks
are gonna be up here

255
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,803
punching in my fuckin' ass!
Shit! Fuck, fuck!

256
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,509
Omar, you follow me,
you do not stop, you understand?

257
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,176
Let's go.

258
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,587
But I saved him, both of them,
I mean, Cutler and Said.

259
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:08,024
What do you want?
Do you want a fucking medal?

260
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,960
You almost
killed a man.

261
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,453
Do you understand that,
God damn it?!

262
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,490
I give you
10 second chances,

263
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,831
this is what
I get in return!

264
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,962
I bend over
backwards for you,

265
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,835
as a result, a man
ends up almost dead.

266
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,932
You want me to be
fuckin' happy about that?

267
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,910
McManus, it is
not that simple. Ms...

268
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,175
Yes, it is that
fuckin' simple, Said.

269
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,148
Don't you be looking
to her for help.

270
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,707
I've made my decision.

271
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,218
The rule book
says solitary.

272
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,118
I'm playing by
the rule book this time.

273
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,953
And if he had done this
to protect you instead of me,

274
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,515
would you be
sending him away?

275
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,356
Shut up, or you're
going with him.

276
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,557
McManus!
McManus! McManus!

277
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,428
That wasn't
for you, Ellie.

278
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,632
No, no, that
was genuine rage.

279
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,664
I remember it well.

280
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,274
Tim...

281
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,081
you think
I divorced you

282
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,214
because you wanted to come
to Oswald and build Emerald City,

283
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,087
but that's not true.

284
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,252
You want to know
what made me leave?

285
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,262
Your relentless,
unflappable,

286
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,264
never-say-never
idealism.

287
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,126
You would have
preferred me cynical?

288
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,068
No!

289
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,129
You want to
save the world

290
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,072
and when you
realize you can't,

291
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,372
you crucify yourself
and everyone around you.

292
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,174
This nonsense,

293
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,011
where it's up to you
to change everything for the better...

294
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,812
your wife,
your prisoners,

295
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,048
whoever else until
we all fit your ideals.

296
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,545
Isn't it time to see that
for the pride that it is?

297
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,960
- Go on.
- No.

298
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,530
I'll just go.

299
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,344
Minister?

300
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,111
Look, whatever it is
that you want...

301
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,085
it can wait.

302
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,054
What I want is for you
not to blame yourself

303
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,614
for what happened
to Omar White.

304
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,092
Well, like I said,
what you want...

305
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,996
can wait.

306
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:42,179
? Amazing grace?

307
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:47,481
? How sweet the sound?

308
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,979
? That saved a wretch?

309
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,357
? Like me...?

310
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,726
Will you
shut the fuck up?!

311
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,527
? I once was lost?

312
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:06,266
? But now I'm found?

313
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,900
? Was blind
but now I see.?

314
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,508
Lmpotence can also be
the result of depression,

315
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,415
marital discord, job stress,
financial worries.

316
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,943
That's right, a little salary
can make a hard man soft.

317
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,981
A drop in the DOW can
diminish rising expectations.

318
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,392
That was my son.

319
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,997
Alex Jr.'s days
away from death.

320
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,666
Gosh, Bob, what are
you gonna do?

321
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,268
What can I do?
I'll wait for the call

322
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,505
that tells me that my
grandson's life is over.

323
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,980
- No, you gotta see him.
- How?

324
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,676
He's in intensive care.

325
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,582
He can't even
leave the hospital,

326
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,416
let alone visit a prison.

327
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,649
- Then you go to him.
- They'd never let me.

328
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,385
Why not? McManus has been
helpful in the past.

329
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,757
Go.

330
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,455
Ask him.

331
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,324
You can cuff me,
shackle me,

332
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,326
gag me if you have to,
just let me see Alex,

333
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,306
make eye contact

334
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,867
so that he knows
that his granddad loves him.

335
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,074
I remember when
you took up that collection

336
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,142
to take him
to Adventure Country.

337
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,618
That trip meant
a lot to him.

338
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,452
It did to me too.

339
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,152
Not only you wanting
to raise the cash,

340
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,184
but then actually rallying
these dinks to help you.

341
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,922
So... may I go?

342
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,132
Yes.

343
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,072
And gagless,

344
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,473
shackleless even.

345
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,740
I'll arrange
the visit today.

346
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,449
- Are you traveling with me?
- No.

347
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,314
Handing you off
at the door.

348
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,684
I was once sentenced
to die, you know?

349
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,690
I remember
something about that.

350
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:11,260
A power failure shut down
the electric chair.

351
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,265
My death was
commuted to life...

352
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,996
legally.

353
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,504
I only wish there were laws
that could do the same for Alex.

354
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,844
But only God can grant
that kind of reprieve.

355
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,233
- Chug.
- Chug.

356
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,865
- Chug.
- Chug.

357
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,103
Chug-a-chug, work it!

358
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,941
This is the best
"Miss Sally" ever.

359
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,947
Mail call!

360
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,814
What you got
for me, Vern?

361
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,613
Mr. Schillinger.

362
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,724
Stinkin' with
cheap perfume.

363
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,160
It's from Norma.

364
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,224
Hey, Fiona,
would you do me a favor?

365
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,736
This letter is
from my former fiancée.

366
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,001
Would you mind
reading it to me?

367
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,837
Make me kind of feel like
she's here in the room.

368
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,071
Hey, we all
got our trip.

369
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,079
"Dear Agamemnon,

370
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,673
I got very depressed
after 'Miss Sally'

371
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,446
- was canceled and I lost my job."
- Poor thing.

372
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,079
"But the one thing that
hasn't been canceled

373
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,284
is my love for you,
and I'm coming to visit on the 15th

374
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,157
to explain why I never showed up
on our wedding day.

375
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,923
If you can find it
in your heart,

376
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,429
please see me.

377
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,159
Love always, Norma."

378
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,259
- Ah, well, ain't that sweet?
- The 15th.

379
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,826
That's today.

380
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:07,468
- Norma!
- Hello, Agamemnon. Wait!

381
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,837
Surprise.

382
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,369
Hey, Bob,

383
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,872
how'd the visit
with little Alex go?

384
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,112
Tired.

385
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,452
Guess what happened
while you were gone.

386
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,691
I'll tell you tomorrow.

387
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,978
If you want, we can talk
more about little Alex.

388
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,915
I have nothing
else to say.

389
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,851
I'm on the death watch.

390
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,020
I fold.

391
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,513
Bob, you've gotta
get some rest.

392
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,595
Did you see that?

393
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,428
See what?

394
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,368
He's gone.

395
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,277
Count!

396
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,770
Your grandson
was stable,

397
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,808
but the storm...

398
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,047
Well, the electricity
went out for a minute

399
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,613
and the surge

400
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,750
scrambled
his equipment.

401
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,957
- And?
- I'm sorry.

402
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:43,093
Alex died.

403
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,796
I need help.

404
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,575
Hey.

405
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,220
I'm real sorry
about little Alex.

406
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,654
You know,

407
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,851
you try to prepare
for a death...

408
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,191
but always secretly
you believe

409
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,027
there's a chance

410
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,660
that the doctors were wrong,
that they'll find a cure,

411
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,695
and that as long as
he's alive, there's time.

412
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,176
So while you think you're steeling
yourself for the sorrow,

413
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,202
all you're really doing
is waiting on the miracle.

414
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,977
Which is why when death comes,
it's so horrible

415
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,178
because you realize...

416
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,153
you weren't
prepared at all.

417
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,553
But you knew last night.

418
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,915
On some level.

419
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,126
30-some years ago
it was a power outage

420
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,998
that saved me from execution,
but last night

421
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,630
the electricity finally came back
on to finish the job.

422
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,697
Except so much
time had passed

423
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,233
that my grandson
was now in the chair.

424
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,820
I never really
liked this hat.

425
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,727
But now that he's passed away,
I understand this hat.

426
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:29,271
This was my grandson
at his most alive.

427
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,181
So I'm gonna let
Rebadow go to the funeral.

428
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,978
Jesus...

429
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,417
after 35 years he gets out
twice in one week,

430
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,580
and all for
the worst reasons.

431
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,214
Holy shit.

432
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,327
I'm back.

433
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,833
I decided...

434
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,802
to give Rebadow his money.

435
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,135
I decided he should
help his grandkid.

436
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,107
New studies show
that even Viagra,

437
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,443
which is supposed to help
a fella get an erection,

438
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,712
can sometimes cause problems
in young, sexually active men

439
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,981
who use the drug
recreationally.

440
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,886
You see, if an erection
lasts longer than six hours,

441
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,652
the blood supply gets
cut off permanently.

442
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,455
Of course,
after six hours, you know,

443
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,985
maybe you don't
give a shit.

444
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,963
You know
what I mean.

445
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,208
Your father and I went
to Adam Guenzel's funeral.

446
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,770
When I saw Olivia walking down
the center aisle of the church,

447
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,179
so crippled up
with arthritis,

448
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,275
moving so slowly, each step
measured, supported by a cane,

449
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,879
my heart...
my heart broke.

450
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,220
You know, when you
were first arrested,

451
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,921
Olivia Guenzel was one
of the few friends who stood by us,

452
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,929
and there we were,

453
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,660
burying her grandson
who caused her so much...

454
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,327
shame.

455
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,633
I'm sorry.

456
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,600
I... couldn't
protect him.

457
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,769
I know.

458
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,575
I know you
did your best.

459
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,247
Funny, when I
hugged Olivia,

460
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:26,018
when I saw the grief
in her eyes,

461
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,457
I thought...

462
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,190
"Good.

463
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,357
Now you really do
understand."

464
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,295
God forgive me.

465
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,071
I almost forgot...

466
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,305
Holly sent you this.

467
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,850
Happy Valentine's Day.

468
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,584
- Winthrop...
- Get away from me, Beecher.

469
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,392
- I need to talk to you.
- I gotta get this food to Schillinger

470
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,331
- or he'll kick my ass.
- I've been where you are.

471
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,834
- You don't have to be his bitch.
- Yeah, right.

472
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,167
- I can help you.
- Like you helped Adam?

473
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,865
No fuckin' thanks.

474
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,008
Sister, at our
last interaction,

475
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,985
you were asking
about Adam Guenzel,

476
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,217
about the circumstances
surrounding his rape,

477
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,782
and I kept silent
at the time

478
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,589
because of...

479
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,758
because of
my own involvement.

480
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,232
Now I think, had I spoken
and told what I knew,

481
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,261
- Adam might still be alive...
- Beecher.

482
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,569
Vern, you know
the rules.

483
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,337
No interruptions.
Go on.

484
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,346
Yes, go on.

485
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,678
Though it's too late
to save Adam,

486
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,017
- I think being honest might...
- Might what?

487
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,353
We're all getting along
so well these days.

488
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,881
- Vern!
- No.

489
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,417
He starts making
wrongful accusations,

490
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,021
all the good work
you've done here will unravel.

491
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,929
You don't want that,
Sister, do you?

492
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,900
I want him
to speak his mind.

493
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,426
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to this horseshit.

494
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,837
- That's your choice. Officers.
- Beecher, tread very carefully.

495
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,069
You tell
the truth, Tobias.

496
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,441
Just tell the truth.

497
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,946
Take Said to his unit.
Beecher stays here.

498
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,286
In accordance with
D.O.C. Regulations,

499
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,558
this committee has
given you a fair hearing.

500
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,327
We have listened to testimony
from witnesses and examined evidence.

501
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,198
We have determined
the following:

502
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,569
One, that you conspired to and engaged
in the rape of Adam Guenzel:

503
00:32:55,606 --> 00:33:00,134
Two, that you conspired to and engaged
in the rape of Franklin Winthrop.

504
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,113
We find you guilty
of these charges

505
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,911
and have decided that you will
be transferred immediately

506
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,851
to solitary confinement
for an undetermined length of time.

507
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,149
Nice color.

508
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,402
Chris?

509
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,104
- How'd the trial go?
- Fantastic.

510
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,205
A jury of my peers found me guilty
of murder in the first degree.

511
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,843
- Oh, God.
- My idiot lawyers are going to appeal,

512
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,012
but he doesn't
hold out much hope.

513
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,079
I go back...

514
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,523
Thursday to the courthouse
for sentencing,

515
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,958
and more than likely...

516
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:53,361
I'll get the death penalty.

517
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,366
Well, I'll do ev...

518
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,063
I'll do everything
I can to help.

519
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,367
Show me your tits.

520
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,106
Don't do that.

521
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,303
I'm sorry.

522
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,508
I guess I'm
in a bad mood.

523
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,745
It's not every day
you get sentenced to death.

524
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,351
Weird.
All of these years

525
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,357
my penis has
dominated my life,

526
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,485
forced me to go in
whatever direction...

527
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,553
it chose.

528
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,191
Now I want to share
my love with someone and...

529
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,003
I never will.

530
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:36,973
You know, there are people
out there who are fighting

531
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,238
against the return
of the death penalty.

532
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,542
Tell that
to Shirley Bellinger.

533
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,980
You know
on the ride over here,

534
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,246
I was thinking about
how I wanted to die.

535
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,083
Well, there's only
two choices now:

536
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:54,421
Lethal injection
and the electric chair.

537
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,826
I want the chair.

538
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,092
I want the juice.

539
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,567
I want to go out
on a charge.

540
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,470
Christopher Keller
was convicted today

541
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,441
in the brutal slaying
of Brice Tibbetts.

542
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,742
Tibbetts was tortured, sodomized,
and murdered in July of 1997.

543
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,748
Keller, who faces
the death penalty,

544
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,149
will be sentenced on Thursday
by Judge Grace Lema.

545
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,484
Keller is suspected of committing
at least two similar murders.

546
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,457
Fuck. I have to
go see him.

547
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,619
May I remind you
of your promise to yourself

548
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,525
- never to speak to Keller again?
- Yeah.

549
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,530
The great thing about breaking
a promise to yourself

550
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,328
is only one person gets hurt,
and I can live with my guilt

551
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,892
a shitload easier than I can live without
ever seeing Keller.

552
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,699
No, this is wrong.

553
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,174
How is love wrong,
Kareem?

554
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,733
In whatever form it takes,
how is love wrong?

555
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,211
Especially here in Oz,

556
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,442
where there's
so little of it.

557
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,851
You and I,
we love each other.

558
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:01,286
You stabbed Schillinger
and Robson for me.

559
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,726
But the Aryans say that any
sort of love between the races

560
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,663
is a perversion.
Who decides these things?

561
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,962
Who chooses which
love is permissible?

562
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,231
God.

563
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,101
The God I worship...

564
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,368
Ioves everybody, and he
created a universe full of

565
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,103
different kinds of people
sharing different kinds of love.

566
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,940
Allah says
"Man..."

567
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,378
Don't quote scripture
to me, Kareem.

568
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,813
You know
what's gonna happen

569
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,407
when you go
and see Keller again.

570
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,850
I'm not gonna fuck him.

571
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,751
I'm just gonna
let him know I care,

572
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,188
that he's not
totally alone.

573
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,590
I think Allah would
approve of that.

574
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,658
Here you go, Keller,
your brand-new home.

575
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,230
They say the ghost of Shirley Bellinger
still haunts this cell.

576
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,800
- Oh, yeah?
- When the moon is full,

577
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:56,677
you could still
smell her vagina.

578
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,482
You're a very funny guy
there, Lopresti.

579
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,214
You should think
about doing comedy.

580
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,548
Hey, how you doing?

581
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,735
Chris.

582
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,114
You got mail.

583
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,479
Diabetes,
multiple sclerosis,

584
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,614
Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's,

585
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,023
high blood pressure,
obesity,

586
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,425
aging can all
cause impotence.

587
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,452
So can riding a bicycle.

588
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,863
You put that hard seat
between your legs,

589
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,766
there may be nothing else
hard between your legs

590
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,997
for a long, long time.

591
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,099
- Suck my fucking...
- Quiet down!

592
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,177
Come on, man.

593
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,701
Get up.

594
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,810
- Leave it.
- No.

595
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,650
Leave it.

596
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,565
Fuckin' retard.

597
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,659
Hang in there, Cyril.

598
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,976
- Where is this?
- End of the line.

599
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,819
I'm not supposed
to be here.

600
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,551
Where's Jericho?

601
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,388
- Relax.
- Where's Jericho?!

602
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,189
- Relax.
- Jericho!

603
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,526
- Oh!
- Ryan!

604
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,395
Go, retard boy!

605
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,300
Ryan!

606
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,495
- Ryan!
- Wow, bitch, let it out!

607
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,269
I'm not
supposed to be here!

608
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,869
I'm not supposed
to be here!

609
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,902
No!

610
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,314
- Finally the S.O.R.T. Team had
to subdue your brother. - Christ.

611
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,215
I gave him some Haldol
to calm him down,

612
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,447
but as we learned
from previous episodes,

613
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,251
it's just
a stopgap measure.

614
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,484
It's never gonna be
a long-term solution

615
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,152
to Cyril's
violent episodes.

616
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,127
We don't need
a long-term solution.

617
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,654
The judge has set
his execution for next month.

618
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,964
- What?
- Why are you acting so surprised?

619
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,493
He was found guilty
of the murder of Li Chen.

620
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,836
The punishment is death.

621
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,843
Look... you're gonna
have to discuss with Cyril

622
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,335
the way he wants to die, either
the electric chair or lethal injection.

623
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,143
Lethal injection.

624
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,514
I want Cyril just to doze off
and go to sleep.

625
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,543
There's more
to it than that.

626
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,956
The drugs they inject into
his body first paralyze him.

627
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,153
I don't want
to hear the details, okay?

628
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,025
It's not okay,
Ryan.

629
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,190
Up to this point you've resisted
all our attempts to help your brother.

630
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,429
You should know
what his last moments will be like.

631
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,494
- Can I see him?
- Not yet.

632
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,701
I'll allow a visit
once he's settled down.

633
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,470
Take O'Reily
back to Em City.

634
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,908
The guilt or innocence
of Cyril O'Reily is not at issue here.

635
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,182
The question is whether
the Eighth Amendment

636
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,689
of our Constitution,
which protects us

637
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,714
from cruel
and unusual punishment,

638
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,227
will also protect
Cyril O'Reily,

639
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,957
whose IQ,
by the way, is 51.

640
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,828
That's one
of the lowest IQs

641
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,800
of any condemned
prisoner on record.

642
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,496
As a mother, I appeal,

643
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,437
I plead to all of the other mothers
and fathers out there

644
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,203
to stop the state from committing
this monstrous act.

645
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,541
Governor Devlin refused
to comment on the demonstration

646
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,672
held outside
the capitol building.

647
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,885
You know, Meehan...

648
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,989
you can hold a million
press conferences,

649
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,287
but you're still won't
be able to save my brother.

650
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,191
If I had that attitude,
you'd be right.

651
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,856
But I'm going to prove
you wrong, Mr. O'Reily.

652
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,764
I'm going to show you
the power of prayer,

653
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,826
of hope, and faith
in the Almighty.

654
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,102
Okay, well while you're at it,
why don't you suck my dick?

655
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,099
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

656
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,881
Father Meehan!

657
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,649
Are you here
for a lesson?

658
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,055
No, I was the only seminarian
booted off the choir.

659
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,684
The prefect said,

660
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,628
"Your voice is
an offense to God."

661
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,496
You were magnificent
on your television press conference.

662
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,628
- Oh, thanks.
- A veritable firebrand.

663
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,434
Well, I've had
a lot of practice.

664
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,237
I want to talk
to you about Ryan.

665
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:29,269
Ever since I came to Oz,
I've been trying to reach him.

666
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:33,215
Well, I know that he and Cyril
were brutalized by their father,

667
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,742
and that's enough
to dent any boy's psyche.

668
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,483
But my gut feeling is
there's something more,

669
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,548
that your son
is hiding something,

670
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,890
some...
some naked truth,

671
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,829
some deeper pain.

672
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,798
I was wondering
if you knew anything.

673
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,825
My greatest regret, Father,
is abandoning my child.

674
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,839
He was just a little baby
when I left,

675
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,741
and until a few months ago,
I've had no contact with him.

676
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,473
Is there anyone
I could ask?

677
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,346
Well, certainly
not his father,

678
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,442
but maybe Brenda
his aunt.

679
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,010
Thank you very much,
Brenda.

680
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,218
Yes, we're doing
everything we can for Cyril.

681
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,488
Right.

682
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,051
Well, keep praying.

683
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:22,361
Lockdown, lockdown!

684
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,471
Ryan, tell me
about Carolyn.

685
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,569
What the fuck
are you talking about?

686
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,707
Carolyn,
your little sister.

687
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,876
She's dead,
end of story.

688
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,351
Then don't
tell me the end,

689
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,547
tell me the beginning,
the middle and all...

690
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,453
Who the fuck told you
about Carolyn?

691
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,391
That doesn't matter.
Just tell me your memory of her.

692
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,826
No.

693
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,352
She died.

694
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,195
She was barely six months old,
fell out of her crib,

695
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,825
and broke her neck.

696
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,428
Why you doin' this?

697
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,430
Well, I've seen
how you love your brother,

698
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,966
how you're
protective of him,

699
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,479
yet you're willing
to let him die,

700
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,777
and I was
wondering why.

701
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,578
I thought I told you
this before.

702
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,347
Death is better
than any day in Oz.

703
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,981
Isn't that what you priests
are always preaching,

704
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,651
the upside
of "life everlasting"

705
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,388
and all that fucking
Catholic nonsense?

706
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,920
Did you have any responsibility
for Carolyn's death?

707
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,160
Were you taking care of her
when she fell?

708
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,690
No, I'm not
talking about this.

709
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,703
I haven't spoken
about my little sister

710
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:36,467
with anyone my entire life,
not even Cyril,

711
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,475
and I'm not about
to start with you!

712
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,239
So, that's what happened,
you think you killed her.

713
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,745
No.

714
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,876
- So, what did happen?
- Shut up!

715
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,249
Ryan,

716
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,983
now is the time
to speak the truth.

717
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,481
You've been carrying this burden
on your back for far too long.

718
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,054
Whatever you say to me
will stay right here between us.

719
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,587
- No, no.
- Like in confession.

720
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:05,500
Now, you can finally say
what you want to say since Carolyn died.

721
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,367
No, fuck you!

722
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,338
God damn it!

723
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,102
Fuck!

724
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,684
- Don't.
- Come on.

725
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,712
- Please, stop.
- Come on.

726
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:34,093
It's all right.
God loves you.

727
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:45,305
I went to a priest,
and I told him the truth

728
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,800
and he didn't
believe me.

729
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,280
And she was so small.

730
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,875
It's my little sister.

731
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,182
I know.
God loves you.

732
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,416
God loves you.

733
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,856
Suddenly I'm famous.

734
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:05,020
I done six interviews,
newspapers and TV,

735
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,963
ever since that nonsense
with your brother started.

736
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,865
I gotta admit, I'm getting
kind of used to the attention.

737
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,836
The guys at Kelsey's have been
buying me rounds every night.

738
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,635
There's this broad,
sits at the end of the bar,

739
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,300
she's been
flirting with me.

740
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,140
I might
just fuck her.

741
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:24,341
You gonna see Cyril
while you're in the building?

742
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,973
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,950
I guess I oughta.

744
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,045
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna say to that boy.

745
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,989
- Tell him you love him.
- Oh, yeah, right.

746
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,151
You ever told
Cyril that, Dad?

747
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:40,289
Cyril or anyone? Ma?

748
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,025
Tessie when
you were married?

749
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,192
Have the words "I love you"
ever crossed your lips?

750
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,259
Because I never
heard them, not once.

751
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,930
Don't start
with your whining.

752
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,064
I'm sorry, I forgot
how sensitive you are.

753
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:53,474
You asked me to come,
I'm here. State your business.

754
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,377
I wanna talk
about Carolyn.

755
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,049
Carolyn?
What about her?

756
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,919
I want to talk about
the day she died.

757
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,983
I remember her crying,
you know,

758
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,656
non-stop for what
seemed like hours.

759
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,722
Tessie couldn't
get her quiet.

760
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,929
You were drunk
and in a foul mood.

761
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,437
- Sit down!
- Fuck you!

762
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,366
You sit...

763
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,037
or I finish
telling my story to a cop.

764
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,085
Carolyn was crying

765
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,715
and you took her
from Tessie's arms

766
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,557
and you put your hands
around her and you shook her

767
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:48,759
and you shook her and you
shook her until she stopped,

768
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,768
until she went limp
like a ragdoll.

769
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,635
She fell
out of her crib.

770
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,400
No.

771
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,637
I was there, Dad.

772
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,436
I was in the doorway.
I saw what happened.

773
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,074
You were just a kid.

774
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,483
What the fuck did you
know about anything?

775
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,216
Think my old man didn't beat me,
that fuckin' scumbag?

776
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,351
My life has been
nothing but shit

777
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,826
since the day
I was born,

778
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,921
and I didn't have no brother
to lean on like you did.

779
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:26,335
I've been alone
my whole fuckin' life,

780
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,271
and soon...

781
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,206
you will be too.

782
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,012
I'll never tell
anyone the truth

783
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,018
about what happened
with Carolyn.

784
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,112
That's between you and me.

785
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,146
But, Dad...

786
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,052
you better pray
to Jesus Christ Almighty himself

787
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,655
that I never get out
of this place.

788
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,126
Because when I do...

789
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,965
I will kill you.

790
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,405
And...

791
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,140
I brought you
some company.

792
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,946
- Jericho.
- Yeah.

793
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,576
Hiya, buddy.

794
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,783
Did you miss me?
I missed you.

795
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,956
Hey, Sister.
Look, I want you to know

796
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,192
that I've decided to become
totally selfish, okay?

797
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,131
I'm not gonna lose
Cyril from my life.

798
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,965
I'm gonna help save him,
and whatever you need me to do,

799
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,994
I'm there 100%.

800
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:37,768
I am so glad
to hear that.

801
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,618
Hey, little brother...

802
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,457
- Who loves you?
- You do.

803
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,091
Fucking-A.

804
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:10,537
Drugs can
cause impotence.

805
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,737
Marijuana,
heroin, steroids.

806
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:16,007
So does alcohol
and tobacco.

807
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,379
72% of men who smoke
20 or more packs a year

808
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,907
suffer from
penile artery clot.

809
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,111
Anybody got an ashtray?

810
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,521
Just because I'm sending
you back to Emerald City

811
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,320
doesn't mean
you're completely well

812
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,850
or that you can stop
taking care of yourself again.

813
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,728
- Uh-huh.
- Don't "uh-huh" me, Augustus,

814
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,132
or I'll come and clean your
catheter myself.

815
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,068
You think it's funny.

816
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,867
You know, when I heard that
you was healthy again, man,

817
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:46,706
and that you was coming back, I kicked
myself with joy. Let me give you a hand.

818
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:49,075
I don't need
no help, man.

819
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,377
Man, you know I always liked you,
Augustus. I always respected you.

820
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,475
Cut the shit, man,
what you want? What?

821
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:00,552
You know Burr got all lathered up
when you went down, all right?

822
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,490
Blamed me for
getting you smack.

823
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,050
You did.
You gave me the tits.

824
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,891
Yeah, I know.

825
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,829
Burr ain't got to
know that, though.

826
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,627
He thinks Guerra
gave you the shit,

827
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,827
so our little peace treaty
with the spics,

828
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,335
it kind of fell apart.

829
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,703
You know, Burr and Morales
got into a little fandango,

830
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,071
now they both
in the hole.

831
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,474
If Burr finds out you was
the one that gave it to me,

832
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,740
- he's gonna skin your fat hide.
- Yeah.

833
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,839
Don't worry, son,
I ain't gonna rat you out.

834
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,976
I wanted those drugs.
It don't matter who gave it to me.

835
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,647
- I'm gonna tell Burr that.
- All right.

836
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,815
Thanks, man.

837
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,690
You know, if I was a girl,
you'd get tongue.

838
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,661
If you was a girl, son,
you'd be butt-ass ugly.

839
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,857
Why you gotta
be all like that, man?

840
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,779
So I was sitting in my office
watching the two of you

841
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,448
when the fight broke out.

842
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,355
Now, I'm not naive
enough to think

843
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,985
that you're gonna tell me
what the argument was about.

844
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,518
You're not naive
enough to think that I'll let it go.

845
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:17,124
So, in order for me to not send
both your asses to Gen Pop,

846
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,101
we're gonna agree,
once again,

847
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,603
no violence
between you.

848
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,730
- I agree.
- Redding?

849
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,262
Sure.

850
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,935
That was a little less than
enthusiastic, but okay.

851
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,467
You can go.

852
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:35,308
So it was Morales that gave
Augustus the drugs, right?

853
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,320
Morales or one of his stooges,
am I right?

854
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,619
Gospel truth,
I don't know.

855
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,319
I thought it was the spics,
but maybe I was wrong.

856
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,658
Then who?

857
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,458
Well, like I said before,

858
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,557
Augustus will give it
to me straight.

859
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,433
You should've let me talk
to him in the first place.

860
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,374
Isn't that touching?

861
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,850
Look, I know I didn't
do right by you guys,

862
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,978
siding with that nigger,

863
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,184
muscling you
out of the tit trade.

864
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:17,159
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Sorry?

865
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,527
- You think sorry's gonna be enough?
- Mario, please.

866
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,093
I think you'll find that
we Sicilians are misunderstood,

867
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,626
that at heart...

868
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,536
we can be
very forgiving people.

869
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,268
Oh, yeah?

870
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,469
And what's that
forgiveness gonna cost?

871
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,638
Redding's 50%,
10 of yours.

872
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,513
- That's bullshit.
- Chico.

873
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,181
Okay.

874
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,985
One condition though.

875
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,818
You kill Redding.

876
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,589
My pleasure.

877
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,597
I got angry when I heard
you was using that shit again.

878
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,902
I wanted to lash out
in every kind of direction.

879
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:13,406
And then I realized that
I was really angry at myself...

880
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,884
for being so blind
that I didn't see

881
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,910
that you had been back
on that shit again,

882
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,253
for getting you strung out
on it in the first place.

883
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,260
- Burr.
- I sat down there at the table,

884
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,922
sitting in your
daddy's chair,

885
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,056
eating your momma's food.

886
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:34,567
And all along Eugenia never knew
that I was feeding you that shit...

887
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,904
that I had you
slinging for me.

888
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:43,106
But why'd I do that?
Why'd I tell a lie?

889
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,706
Why'd I hurt
that sweet girl?

890
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,650
Listen, it's like
you said, Burr,

891
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,619
life happens the way
life happens.

892
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,986
No, man,
that's a copout.

893
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,116
We make life happen.

894
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,887
I got you strung out
on that shit

895
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,918
'cause I wanted you
dependent on me.

896
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,955
'Cause I was always afraid
you was gonna leave me.

897
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,465
And yet, I almost lost you
altogether forever.

898
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,170
Burr...

899
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,737
you never need no drugs
to keep me close to you, man.

900
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,842
I always loved you.

901
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,651
Always.

902
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,660
Look at me, acting like
a weepy old woman now.

903
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:58,146
Burr, no! No!

904
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:30,446
Get him a doctor,
for Christ's sake!

905
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,115
Redding, let him
the fuck go, let him go!

906
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,855
Jesus Christ.

907
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,132
L-l...

908
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,226
I can feel my legs.
