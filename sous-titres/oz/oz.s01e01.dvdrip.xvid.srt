1
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,069
Oz.

2
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:40,657
That's the name on the street

3
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,696
for the Oswald Maximum
Security Penitentiary.

4
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:48,953
Oz is retro.

5
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,006
Oz is retribution.
You wanna punish a man?

6
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,837
Separate him from his family,
separate him from himself,

7
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,465
cage him up with his own kind.

8
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:12,144
Oz is hard times doing hard time.

9
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,403
McManus, don't you ever knock?

10
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,938
Been through the files
of the inmates that arrived today.

11
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:18,907
- l want Tobias Beecher.
- Okay.

12
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,869
- Miguel Alvarez.
- That'll be tough. He's in the hospital,

13
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:24,445
- stab wound to the chest.
- He gonna live?

14
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:26,283
- Apparently.
- Fuck you, Healy.

15
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,038
- All right.
- Shut the fuck up, asshole,

16
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:30,996
before l come in there--

17
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,413
- Hey, warden.
- Hello, Mike.

18
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,250
And l want Donald Groves.

19
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,501
- Groves?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,919
Let me ask you something,
don't take this the wrong way.

21
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:42,096
- What?
- Are you out of your mind?

22
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:45,474
Groves is a demented sociopath
without a scoosh of remorse.

23
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:48,182
- Well, maybe.
- He ate his parents.

24
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:50,638
He killed them,
carved them up, and he ate them.

25
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:52,974
- What can you do with him?
- Teach him table manners.

26
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:55,862
The only thing a guy like that
understands is punishment,

27
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,613
hard and swift.

28
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,780
Leo, you said it yourself,
our first conversation,

29
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:04,572
all we do is recycle.

30
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,540
- Warden, need to talk to you.
- Later, Johnson, later.

31
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,747
A new inmate comes in,
we sit on him,

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,665
send him back out,
he's back with a vengeance.

33
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,671
lf we don't do something different,

34
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:18,215
we don't do something radical,
we're never gonna break the chain.

35
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:21,593
Groves isn't going out. He's here
till God drop-kicks him to hell.

36
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,465
Do l have to call the commissioner?

37
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:27,382
l was given total autonomy
to run cell block 5 my way.

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,264
Fine, take Groves.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,687
- Thank you.
- And Paul Markstrom.

40
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,939
Markstrom? He's a petty drug dealer

41
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:36,860
and l got enough petty drug dealers.

42
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,730
You want Groves,
you take Markstrom.

43
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,779
- Why?
- Warden, l need to talk to you, man.

44
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,782
- Why?
- Just give me five minutes.

45
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:45,116
He's my cousin.

46
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,824
Timmy McManus.

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,788
He created
an experimental unit inside Oz,

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,582
a new approach
to the prison problem.

49
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,872
Some people call it Emerald City.

50
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,127
To me, it's a concentration camp.

51
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:03,212
ln Emerald City we got rules,

52
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:06,010
got a lot more rules
than anywhere else in Oz.

53
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:12,145
Your cell is your home,
keep it clean, spotless.

54
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,398
You are to exercise regularly,
attend classes,

55
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,811
go to drug and alcohol counselling.

56
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:23,323
You are to work
in one of the prison factories.

57
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,404
You are to follow the routine.

58
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,111
We tell you when to sleep,

59
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:32,866
when to eat, when to piss.

60
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:38,079
There is no yelling,
no fighting, no fucking.

61
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:42,877
Follow the rules,
learn self-discipline,

62
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:47,176
because if you had any self-discipline,
any control over yourself at all,

63
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,430
you wouldn't be sitting here now.

64
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:52,134
- Questions?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,726
- Can l go to the bathroom?
- Tuck it in, tough guy.

66
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,148
Okay, these are your sponsors,

67
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,606
they will help you
get used to the routine.

68
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,525
l don't want any fucking sponsors.

69
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,318
l don't want any fucking routine.

70
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,984
- Shut up, Groves.
- Hi, l'm Bob Rebadow.

71
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,495
Nice to meet you too.

72
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,167
Paul Markstrom, Jefferson Keane.

73
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:25,928
Yo.

74
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:30,804
Tobias Beecher, Dino Ortolani.

75
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,677
- l really have to do this?
- Cut the shit. lt's your turn.

76
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:37,522
Hello.

77
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,895
Beecher, huh?

78
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:44,444
l'm guessing you ain't ltalian.
What're you in for?

79
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,615
Shaving strokes off your golf score?

80
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:51,154
Prisoner number 9 7B4 1 2,
Tobias Beecher.

81
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,871
Convicted July 5, '9 7.

82
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,126
Driving while intoxicated,
vehicular manslaughter.

83
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:06,343
Sentence: 1 5 years.
Up for parole in four.

84
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,683
ln Oz, the guards lock the cages
and walk away

85
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:16,764
and the predators rise,
take control, and make the rules.

86
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:22,726
But in Em City, the guards
are with us 2 4 hours a day.

87
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:26,859
There's no privacy. Everybody sees
what everybody's doing.

88
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:31,118
Eyes everywhere. McManus' eyes.

89
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,537
See, in Em City,
retribution gives way to redemption.

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,290
Timmy boy believes he can save
every one of us, from each other,

91
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:41,503
from ourselves, from the system
that dumped us in here.

92
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:44,750
Only thing he don't get is,
you gotta want to be saved.

93
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,377
Hey, Dino. How you doing?

94
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,632
Hey, look, pal, l know
l'm supposed to be some kind of bro,

95
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:55,308
but the headline reads:
''l don't give a shit about you.''

96
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:58,641
That's fine, Dino. Okay.

97
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:01,940
Hey, let me give you
a slice of advice.

98
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,190
Get yourself a weapon.

99
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,736
Anyone tries to fuck with you,
take them out.

100
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:12,443
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:16,410
- Don't smile. Ever.
- Dino, telephone.

102
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,871
What are you looking at?

103
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:31,633
You got a code for the phone, man?

104
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,172
- MCl.
- What's the number?

105
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:36,384
Hey, Ginnie, how you doing, baby?

106
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,436
- Yeah, baby, l miss you too.
- Get out the line.

107
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,060
Are the kids around?

108
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,603
l could have sworn
l seen the motherfucker in my cell

109
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,488
Going through my personal effects

110
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,320
He fingers, fingering my cigarettes

111
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:56,489
Came out like nothing was happening
Whistling his tune

112
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:59,913
So l mushed his ass, like,
''Move, motherfucker, make room!

113
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,372
Hey. Ain't that my cigarette
hanging off the tip of your lip?''

114
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:07,002
l didn't even give him a chance
For any confession

115
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,250
Just levelled his ass
With all that aggression

116
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:13,168
Left, right, to the dolex
Foots to the chest

117
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:17,801
Uppercuts to the grill, l'm like ''Kill!''
He's like ''Chill!''

118
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,394
Take that for me
even being in this place

119
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:25,437
Take that for that fucking CO
Baton across my face

120
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:28,320
Feel that for that lawyer
Who ain't give two fucks about me

121
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,735
And feel this, feel this for me

122
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:34,399
Being enslaved by poverty,
Motherfucker

123
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:37,287
Give me them damn cigarettes

124
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:41,578
Oh, these is Marlboros.
l don't smoke these.

125
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:45,916
l got some veal coming
you are gonna love.

126
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:53,171
- Excuse me, may l sit here?
- No.

127
00:08:57,307 --> 00:09:01,720
- Excuse me, is anybody sitting here?
- You.

128
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,475
- You're right, you know.
- Beg pardon?

129
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,981
- You're right.
- About what?

130
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,524
Genevieve.

131
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:14,823
She's thinking about divorcing you.
ln fact, she's having lunch

132
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,990
with your old law partner
to talk her through.

133
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:20,987
- How do you know my wife's name?
- God told me.

134
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:24,824
Attention! According to new state
health guidelines,

135
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:27,872
starting the end of the month
smoking will be prohibited

136
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:29,796
inside Oswald Penitentiary.

137
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:34,425
Settle down! Settle down!

138
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,878
Anyone caught with tobacco
will be charged

139
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:41,047
with possession of contraband
and sent to ad seg!

140
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,556
That is all.

141
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:03,748
So this is where
they make the prison uniforms?

142
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:06,792
Well, actually, no.
The uniforms come from Taiwan.

143
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:09,536
These are prison clothes
we make to sell.

144
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,628
Sell? To who?

145
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,711
They're hip. Or hop.
l'm not sure which.

146
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,834
Grab a bolt and pull.

147
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,806
You know, l'm not really
used to doing this kind of work.

148
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:30,684
Not that l think there's anything wrong
with it or demeaning.

149
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,107
- What'd you do on the outside?
- l was a lawyer.

150
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,318
l hate lawyers
almost as much as l hate cops.

151
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,415
Count!

152
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,121
- What now?
- We go to our cells,

153
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:51,583
they count heads,
then lock us up for the night.

154
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:54,548
lt's 5:00.
What am l supposed to do?

155
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:58,257
- What time is lights out?
- 1 0 p.m.

156
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,839
- What do l do for five hours?
- Try to keep breathing.

157
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:15,398
Hey, what are you doing with my stuff?
Come on, those are mine.

158
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:20,782
Anything you got belongs to me.

159
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:23,234
You understand?

160
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,953
Time to count, gentlemen.
Come on out.

161
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,953
l was getting to know
my new cell mate.

162
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,643
There's something in the air...

163
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,647
...and it ain't love.

164
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,467
l won't be fucking you, prag.

165
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:28,309
At least, not tonight.

166
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:39,442
Hey. Mind if l sit here?

167
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:43,991
Vern Schillinger.

168
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:49,495
l understand.

169
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,084
l saw last night, Adebisi giving you shit,
taking your stuff.

170
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,546
This morning he stole my watch.

171
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,216
That sucks.

172
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,668
He tried the same shit with me
when l first got here.

173
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:09,099
What did you do?

174
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,726
l went to McManus, asked him
to switch me to another pod.

175
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,896
- And he did?
- Yeah, sure.

176
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:20,228
Just don't say
it has to do with Adebisi.

177
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,189
You get him in trouble
and he'll kill you.

178
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:27,281
- ln the meantime, wear armour.
- Armour?

179
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,052
- You ratted on me.
- Back off.

180
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:59,607
- Who are you telling to back off?
- You, boy.

181
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,363
Oh, yeah? Make me back off.

182
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,578
Play nice.

183
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,466
- l'm on top.
- Okay.

184
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:29,888
You're not a Jew, are you?

185
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:32,305
Me? Jewish?

186
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:35,518
l don't even like Barbra Streisand.

187
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,055
Like my tattoos?

188
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,103
l'm gonna have to get you one.

189
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,365
- No, thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,197
l'm gonna brand you myself.

191
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,662
Livestock gets branded.

192
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,830
Livestock. That's what you are.

193
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:02,084
My livestock.

194
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:05,337
Because now, Tobias...

195
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:08,387
...your ass belongs to me.

196
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:15,673
They call this the penal system,
but it's really the penis system.

197
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:19,393
lt's about how big, it's about how long,
it's about how hard.

198
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,228
Life in Oz
is all about the size of your dick

199
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:26,310
and anybody who tells you different
ain't got one.

200
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:52,552
- Bitch, come on. Breakfast.
- No.

201
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,885
- Suit yourself.
- Shakedown.

202
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,315
No, that ain't mine. That ain't mine!

203
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,118
- You asshole.
- Hey, get this scum out of here,

204
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:17,867
do you believe this?

205
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:20,619
Shakedowns aren't enough.
We need more than a few sniffing dogs

206
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,503
- to stop the flow of drugs.
- We need to fight the addiction.

207
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:27,128
- No, no, we need to fight the traffic.
- How do we do that?

208
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,799
Weeklong lockdown.

209
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,844
Let's see them trying to move their shit
sitting in their cells 24/7.

210
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:34,627
Yeah, so l get it.
Your big idea is punish everybody,

211
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,177
guilty or not, right?

212
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:38,384
l don't hear you coming up
with anything better.

213
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:42,220
l'm telling you, Leo, fucking McManus
is out of fucking control.

214
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:45,191
He tells me yesterday
he's thinking of starting a quiet time.

215
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,440
You ready for that?
An hour every day

216
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,894
when the cons gotta sit in silence.
l mean, what's next?

217
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:51,656
Milk and cookies? Arts and crafts?

218
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,356
Maybe you should've listened
to what l was saying, Healy.

219
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,284
We gotta make them
be quiet in here,

220
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:58,078
because when they get out
and get a job,

221
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,572
they're gonna have to sit
and do their work and be quiet.

222
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,240
Come on, man. What kind
of fairy dust you been snorting?

223
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,212
These stupid fucks aren't gonna go
work for fucking Microsoft.

224
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,544
- lt's bullshit.
- lf an inmate survives Oz,

225
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,835
he's got balls on the street. l wanna
take some of the glamour away.

226
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:13,926
l wanna take some of the glory
away from that.

227
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:17,553
Maybe a high school education,
maybe to learn to fucking read.

228
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,055
lf everybody's done making speeches,
l'm moving on.

229
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,895
- Next item, no-smoking rule.
- More bullshit.

230
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,058
You expect us to enforce this ban?

231
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:28,604
These are state guidelines,

232
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,396
recommended
by the Board of Corrections,

233
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:32,735
passed by the legislature,
signed by the governor.

234
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:34,691
The governor is an asshole.

235
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,984
You mean politically
or are you speaking personally?

236
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,658
He campaigned on the ''no perks
for prisoners'' platform.

237
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:41,414
He's gonna reinstate
the death penalty,

238
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:43,995
he's gonna slash our budget,
he's gonna incite a riot.

239
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,662
- A riot?
- Yeah.

240
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:48,878
l heard what happened in the cafeteria.
lt's just gonna escalate.

241
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,461
This place is fuelled by smoke.

242
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:54,296
l know that Marlboros
aren't gonna disappear.

243
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,504
They're just gonna go underground
like drugs.

244
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,342
l said we have to enforce the new
rules. l didn't say that l like them.

245
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:04,307
Next item, Kareem Said.

246
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,514
Now, he arrives today
and l don't have to tell you

247
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:08,309
what a potential powder keg
this can be,

248
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,277
not just because he blew up
a white-owned warehouse

249
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:14,571
in his community.
Said claims that he is not a criminal,

250
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,110
that he is a political prisoner,

251
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:19,279
and until all the appeals
and shit are cleared,

252
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:21,452
he is to be treated with kid gloves.

253
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:23,407
After that,
we can bury him in gen pop.

254
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:30,127
Prisoner number 9 7 S444.

255
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:31,328
Open.

256
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:32,917
Kareem Said

257
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,924
a.k.a. Goodson Truman.

258
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,169
Convicted June 6th, '9 7.

259
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:40,305
Arson in the second degree.
Sentence: 1 8 years.

260
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,385
Eligible for parole in five.

261
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:55,313
ln Em City we treat each other the way
that we would like to be treated.

262
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,570
We treat each other with respect.

263
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:02,195
And what happens when one of us
does not respect the other?

264
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:03,741
There's violence.

265
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,452
Then prison life isn't all that different
to the outside world.

266
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:10,166
Your celebrity status doesn't buy you
any extra advantages here.

267
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,249
All my prisoners are equal.

268
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,211
How ironic.

269
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:20,502
To finally be an equal in a place where
l do not have the freedom to enjoy it.

270
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,928
You do the work assigned you,
you stay out of trouble,

271
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:28,887
we're gonna get along just fine.

272
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:33,020
Otherwise, you go into the general
population and, Kareem,

273
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:37,523
in the rest of Oz, nobody's treated
the way they would like to be treated.

274
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:41,112
Then l consider myself warned.

275
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,121
l've read a couple of your books.

276
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,823
l know the influence
that you can have over other men.

277
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:51,787
So l'm hoping we can work together,

278
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,836
make everybody's
stay here more productive.

279
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:57,584
l would like to help my brothers
live a full life.

280
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,585
Yes, so would we all.

281
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:03,722
- Anything else we can tell you?
- No.

282
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:07,973
- l do have one thing l can tell you.
- What's that?

283
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,805
Seventy-eight percent
of the population

284
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:13,188
at Oswald State Penitentiary
are men of colour.

285
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,691
The ratio is, at last count,
one officer for every nine prisoners.

286
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:21,610
We could take this prison
anytime we want to.

287
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:23,902
You could take it,

288
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,284
but you wouldn't be able to keep it.

289
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:27,991
That remains to be seen.

290
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,825
You telling me
you intend to start a riot?

291
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,999
What l'm telling you is,

292
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,286
as of today...

293
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:36,922
...l run Oz.

294
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:41,760
Don't you fuck with me, my brother.

295
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,719
- Officers.
- Asalaam aleikum, brother.

296
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,978
There is always in Oz
an undercurrent of fear,

297
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,651
of violence,

298
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,363
of hate,

299
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,867
waiting to explode.

300
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:25,345
Prisoner number 96C382,
Dino Ortolani.

301
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:29,844
Convicted December 1 2, '96.
One count murder in the first degree,

302
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:31,643
assault with a deadly weapon.

303
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:37,316
Sentence: Life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.

304
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,547
- McManus, we gotta talk.
- About what?

305
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:10,338
- About sex.
- Sister, you're insatiable.

306
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,136
And you are not that funny.

307
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:16,184
Now, look, Dino Ortolani
has requested a conjugal visit.

308
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:17,726
So?

309
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:22,444
Well, that would make it
the fourth since January.

310
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:25,192
- So?
- Well, so it's part of my job

311
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,863
to arrange for inmates
and their wives--

312
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,535
Excuse me, am l in your way here?

313
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,614
To arrange for inmates
and their wives to make whoopie.

314
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:36,537
And it's part of your job to tell me

315
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,664
if said inmate
has earned said whoopie.

316
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,296
Four times in a year. That's more sex
than l had when l was married.

317
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,584
Maybe that's why you're divorced.

318
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:48,210
Give him a six-hour conjugal.

319
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,597
- Wow, is that all?
- Yep.

320
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,219
Well, l just hope
he's not a premature ejaculator.

321
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:12,825
Whoa, for a second there
l thought you'd escaped.

322
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,324
- Thanks, kid.
- He ate his mother.

323
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:20,540
- Get out of here.
- So l heard.

324
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:24,586
He killed her, then he blew off
her head, smothered it in onions.

325
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,134
- What, no garlic?
- He had his father in the freezer.

326
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:32,129
Sick fuck. What the fuck's
wrong with this country?

327
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,225
ln the old days, murder was murder.
You killed someone, it was business.

328
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:38,928
- You sure as Christ didn't eat them.
- Times have changed, Nino.

329
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:40,606
Fuck that. Times changed.

330
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:44,351
Nothing changes.
Nothing ever changes.

331
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:50,155
Now, my brothers,
we must dedicate ourselves

332
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,739
to a whole different set of principles,

333
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:55,526
to a whole new set of priorities.

334
00:23:55,747 --> 00:24:00,575
We must rekindle
our natural sense of purity.

335
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:05,171
Our heart and our mind
must be cleansed and set free.

336
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:08,708
And that means no drugs...

337
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:14,760
...no alcohol,
and no cigarettes, brother.

338
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,219
Yes, my brother.

339
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:24,139
No foul language
and no abnormal sex.

340
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,435
You see these temptations?

341
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:30,740
They must be replaced
by a strict discipline

342
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:34,074
and a channelled focus.

343
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:37,495
And not only will our lives here
in Satan's house be improved,

344
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:41,573
- but our spirits will be renewed.
- Yes, brother.

345
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,374
We are not a gang of hoodlums.

346
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:47,790
We are a group of men

347
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:51,626
rooted in Africa
and living in America.

348
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:55,095
We are strong and proud.

349
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,976
We are an entity, a presence.

350
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:03,143
We are a force
and we must be dealt with.

351
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:07,354
We are voices
and we must be heard.

352
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,528
Now, this white man, he may have
enslaved us with his laws,

353
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:20,695
and he may have
enslaved us in his jail,

354
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,200
but he has not...

355
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,542
...cannot...

356
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:30,831
...will not enslave the very essence

357
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,886
of our mortal soul.

358
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:44,720
- You hearing this shit?
- Yeah.

359
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,398
This fuck Said is a threat.

360
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:53,234
You tell Schibetta
we gotta stick together on this one.

361
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,108
- See me riding a bicycle?
- What?

362
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:57,401
l ain't a messenger.
You got something to tell Nino,

363
00:25:57,577 --> 00:25:58,906
- tell him yourself.
- Yeah, yeah.

364
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:04,075
Hey, lookie here.
We might not have to worry.

365
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:09,750
Fuck you doing, Kareem?

366
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,514
You like being on your knees, yes?
Maybe you like to suck these?

367
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,891
What the fuck you doing, huh?
Get your ass out of here.

368
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:26,057
You talking to my boys
about dealing drugs?

369
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:30,187
- Stay the fuck out my business.
- ls this what you want?

370
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:34,070
- ls this really what you want?
- To bust your ass, yeah.

371
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,024
We Muslims believe in nonviolence.

372
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,239
We believe in respecting
our neighbour.

373
00:26:38,452 --> 00:26:40,444
Well, we don't.

374
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,374
- l will give my life for you.
- You gonna have to.

375
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:48,120
So be it.

376
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,287
Brother, hit me.

377
00:26:52,924 --> 00:26:54,584
Now, l told you to hit me,
now hit me.

378
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:58,301
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

379
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,262
Hit me in the face, brother.

380
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,563
Again.

381
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,734
Harder.

382
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:16,645
What the hell's going on over there?
Come on, break it up.

383
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:19,739
You a crazy motherfucker,
you know that?

384
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,656
Asalaam aleikum, brother.

385
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:25,445
Peace be unto you.

386
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:39,376
- What day is it?
- Friday.

387
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:40,930
Friday? Feels more like Monday.

388
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:43,719
Ready for this? Guess who's
checking into Oz tomorrow?

389
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:47,979
- Your Uncle Vinnie.
- No, feds got Vinnie.

390
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:50,348
Ryan O'Reily.

391
00:27:51,024 --> 00:27:53,396
- Get the fuck out of here.
- l'm shitting you?

392
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,686
Why am l gonna shit you
about that scum?

393
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,736
Gotta be crazy
to put the motherfucker near me.

394
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,444
Maybe they know exactly
what they're doing. Be careful, Dino.

395
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,939
He ain't gonna be in Em City.

396
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,661
He gonna be somewhere
over the rainbow.

397
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,448
l'm gonna cap that motherfucker.

398
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,538
You ain't gonna do a fucking thing...

399
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,418
...unless l say so.

400
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:11,541
...unless l say so.

401
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:33,978
Thanks.

402
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:36,767
Count.

403
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:38,689
Oz is where l live.

404
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:44,066
Oz is where l will die,
where most of us will die.

405
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:46,611
What we were don't matter.

406
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,617
What we are don't matter.

407
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,909
What we become...

408
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,249
...don't matter.

409
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:01,708
Does it?

410
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,964
Hey, what's up?

411
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,379
You fucking faggot.

412
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,769
Come on, get up.

413
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,945
He's gotta disrespect
me like that, man.

414
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,360
Are you stupid or what?

415
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:07,326
There are cops all around the place.

416
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:12,248
- Who's Keane?
- Me.

417
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,450
- So?
- l'm O'Reily.

418
00:30:14,668 --> 00:30:16,127
Like l said, so?

419
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:19,006
l heard you can take care
of a little business for me.

420
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,920
- What kind of business?
- Dino Ortolani.

421
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:27,137
l want him airholed
and l am willing to pay.

422
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,267
We don't kill wise guys around here.

423
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,685
Yum-yum, plastic.

424
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:45,063
My brother says hello.

425
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:47,156
Says you can help.

426
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:50,075
l'm here, ain't l?

427
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,617
Open gate 57 Vegas.

428
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:56,994
Shut it.

429
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:02,204
- Who?
- Ortolani.

430
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:05,129
The niggers are afraid to touch him.

431
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:08,635
You don't have to worry
about wasting Ortolani.

432
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,506
He's on self-destruct.

433
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:31,699
All right. Yeah.
Spread you on the floor. Give it up.

434
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:55,009
Fucking faggot!

435
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:27,670
Back to your cells. Lockdown.
Back to your cells.

436
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:29,213
What happened? What happened?

437
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,883
- Lockdown. Lockdown.
- Who did this to my brother?

438
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:33,431
Who did this to my brother?

439
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:35,553
Don't play with that.

440
00:32:35,726 --> 00:32:38,347
You better hope they get Billie Keane
to City Hospital on time.

441
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:41,100
lf he flames out,
you're up for murder.

442
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:43,188
Doctor, l'm in here for life.

443
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,520
l don't think one more murder's
gonna matter.

444
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,068
By the way,
you have an angel's touch.

445
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,902
When you were outside,
you ever get laid with a line like that?

446
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:55,451
- Outside l was faithful to my wife.
- Yeah.

447
00:32:55,662 --> 00:32:59,245
l was faithful by choice.
ln here l don't got no choice.

448
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:00,786
Or do l?

449
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:04,378
No choice, no chance.

450
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,287
How come you're not volunteering
over at the women's prison?

451
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:10,253
How come you're in here
shaking your tits in front of 1 400 guys?

452
00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:13,838
l'm trying to meet men
and l'm bored with the bar scene.

453
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:17,005
- So you married?
- lt's none of your business.

454
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:18,601
Because l gotta wonder about a guy

455
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,850
who'd let his slice
come into a pit like this.

456
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:22,806
l mean, don't he got
any concern for you?

457
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:27,601
- He's got plenty of concern.
- So you are married.

458
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,980
You happy?

459
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:31,983
Happy, doctor?

460
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:34,441
Oh, l'm delirious.

461
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:41,365
Yep.

462
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,333
Yeah, have a seat, Dino.

463
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:48,463
- Take the cuffs off, please.
- You sure?

464
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:52,458
Am l sure? Yeah, l'm sure.
Take the cuffs off, please.

465
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:58,214
You can wait outside.

466
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:05,849
How you doing, Dino?

467
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,435
You doing a lot better
than Billie Keane

468
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:10,063
because he's in intensive care now.

469
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,520
- l don't start fights.
- Yeah, l know, you finish them.

470
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:14,026
l'm gonna tell you something.

471
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,904
l'm gonna say it once and l'm gonna
say it as simply as l can.

472
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,404
Every inmate, every officer
either hates your guts

473
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:23,327
or they're terrified of you, or both.

474
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:26,913
Being popular
has never been a big concern of mine.

475
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,168
Well, how about staying alive?

476
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,172
ls that a concern, huh?

477
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,887
Keep it up,
someone's gonna kill you.

478
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,718
So what?

479
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:43,219
l'll be sitting in that cell until they carry
my guinea ass out in a body bag

480
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,553
so why don't you shut up
and put me in the hole?

481
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:53,232
Dino, do you know why in Em City
l put lifers in with all the rest?

482
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:56,313
So that people can learn
to live together.

483
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,442
And not just
for when they get released.

484
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,653
Even if you're in here
for the rest of your life,

485
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,828
even if you're in here until you die,

486
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,116
your life can have some purpose.

487
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:10,290
Hey, you hear that?

488
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:11,916
Are you on drugs, McManus?

489
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:13,460
lf you're not, you should start.

490
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:17,839
You know, this is your third fight
related to a homosexual encounter.

491
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:20,216
You can't go swinging on a guy

492
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,259
every time
he makes a pass at you, Dino.

493
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:24,468
What am l supposed to do?
The guy's being faggish,

494
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:26,394
stroking his dick,
trying to make it hard.

495
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,811
- Laugh it off.
- l don't have that sense of humour.

496
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:33,604
As punishment,
instead of putting you in lockup,

497
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,564
l'm assigning you to work
in the AlDS ward.

498
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:37,489
- What the fuck?
- Mr. Healy.

499
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:39,656
Are you fucking nuts?
l work the kitchen.

500
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,618
You work in the AlDS ward.

501
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:47,287
You fucking punk!
Get the fuck out of my office.

502
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:49,620
Nino, you gotta do something
about this, man.

503
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:51,663
You gotta get me off
this hospital duty shit.

504
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,255
Who the fuck are you talking to?

505
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,090
l don't gotta do a fucking thing.

506
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,629
l'm telling you right now, man,

507
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:58,635
l am not touching
no diseased faggots.

508
00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:01,633
- Most of them are junkies.
- Junkies, l don't care how they got it.

509
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:03,675
- l don't wanna get it.
- Then be careful.

510
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:06,514
- Are you saying you won't do nothing?
- That's right.

511
00:36:07,437 --> 00:36:11,850
- l run the kitchen, Nino.
- You're raising your voice to me.

512
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:18,067
This is what l'm talking about.

513
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,148
You gotta learn to behave.

514
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,693
Wise guys been running these joints
for generations.

515
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:26,617
How? With this:

516
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:28,702
And this:

517
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,159
We run the racket
same as on the street,

518
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:33,834
but you, you're arrabbiato.

519
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:36,710
You're gonna kill O'Reily,
you're gonna kill the faggot.

520
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:38,717
You gotta learn to think
before you act.

521
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:40,884
Life ain't an ice pick.

522
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,557
So go play nursemaid for a while.

523
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,300
Go wipe some asses.

524
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:52,565
- Wipe some asses.
- Yeah.

525
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:57,107
Fuck McManus.
Fuck these motherfuckers.

526
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:09,455
Chow time, Sanchez.

527
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,873
- l'm not hungry.
- Dr. Nathan said you might say that.

528
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:14,042
Dr. Nathan said to feed you anyway.

529
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:20,289
Jesus, one of my kids.

530
00:37:22,512 --> 00:37:25,300
- Open your mouth.
- l wanna die, man.

531
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:29,893
Open your goddamn motherfucking
cocksucking mouth.

532
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:32,854
Well, thanks a lot.

533
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:35,057
lt's so good to see you too, Gloria.

534
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:37,683
Thanks for shackling me
with Dino Ortolani.

535
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:39,777
Not only can't he keep
his hands off my fanny,

536
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:43,025
he's got the bedside manner
of Attila the Hun.

537
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,697
Well, he gets into a fight,

538
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:47,868
l stick him in the hole. Every time.

539
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,574
l'm trying to break the pattern here.

540
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,701
He's a violent criminal,
a thug born to kill. He'll never change.

541
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,830
So, what do you suggest, then?

542
00:37:57,047 --> 00:38:00,250
Caning? Castration?

543
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:02,009
Lorazepam.

544
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:05,216
Sedate Ortolani
with 4 milligrams of Lorazepam.

545
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,756
Put him in a passive state,
he gets a great buzz,

546
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:11,178
- and he doesn't harm anyone.
- Better prison through chemistry?

547
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:14,431
- Grow some balls, Tim.
- Free for dinner tonight?

548
00:38:14,648 --> 00:38:16,687
- l'm married.
- You're separated.

549
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:21,104
Wanna have dinner?

550
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:23,321
Yes.

551
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:27,526
- l'll have balls by then.
- Hopefully.

552
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:32,864
My brother's lying in the fucking
hospital, half-dead,

553
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,785
tubes up his nose
because of that dago.

554
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:38,243
What do you want?

555
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:41,091
l heard you were having a meeting
about Ortolani.

556
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:45,125
- Brothers only.
- Yeah, whatever.

557
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,552
What's going on?
What you all doing in here?

558
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,715
He's just consoling me
about my brother.

559
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:54,595
Well, your brother's a fag, Keane.
They say it runs in families.

560
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:56,729
You a fag too?

561
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:59,816
Why don't you suck my dick
and find out?

562
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:05,655
You got two minutes to finish
your work. Everybody else out.

563
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:14,283
That's cute.
You and me, we can get this job done.

564
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:18,501
Johnny, you're up. l want you to go
in the hole and whack that wop.

565
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:21,464
McManus didn't put Ortolani
in the hole.

566
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,962
He's got him doing bedpan duty
in the AlDS ward.

567
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,376
- Yeah?
- Yeah. lt'll take a couple days,

568
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:29,050
but l'll get your man Post here
reassigned to the AlDS ward.

569
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:31,340
Fine. When the moment's right,

570
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:34,559
you take that guinea out.
For all of us.

571
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,902
Dino, my friend.

572
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,495
l've been looking for you.

573
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,363
Yeah, what do you want,
Schillinger?

574
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:00,243
Heard you crippled Billie Keane.

575
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:03,878
- The Aryan Brotherhood is grateful.
- Swell.

576
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,508
Just trying to give you
a little jizz here.

577
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:08,711
l don't need your jizz.

578
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:11,681
- Fuck you, then.
- Fuck you.

579
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,298
What happened in that shower
was between me and the fag boy,

580
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:17,181
had nothing to do with you,
you fucking redneck scumbag.

581
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:21,353
Why don't you take your pure white
ass and get the fuck away from me?

582
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:24,151
Stupid grease-ball.

583
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:25,689
Count!

584
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:29,777
Grease-ball, cracker, mick,
spic, kike, gook, nigger.

585
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,661
Words. Words are weapons.

586
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,954
l'd rather have
a Mac- 1 0 anytime, though.

587
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:41,075
Some inmates say that violence
is the worst thing we gotta face.

588
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:44,254
For me, the worst thing
is the great yawn.

589
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:47,335
How do you fill day
after dull-ass day?

590
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:49,881
We have these routines
that are supposed to give our lives

591
00:40:50,095 --> 00:40:51,423
order and meaning.

592
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:55,090
But l'm here to testify l'm less afraid
of getting shanked in my back

593
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:56,637
than the routine.

594
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:59,010
Because the routine,

595
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:01,638
man, the routine'll kill you.

596
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,569
l wanna see my daughter.

597
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:57,320
Hey, l wanna see my daughter.

598
00:41:57,537 --> 00:42:01,156
You're more fucking trouble
than you're worth, Sanchez.

599
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,868
You have a daughter?

600
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,244
l thought you were queer.

601
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,539
Queers have daughters.

602
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:11,216
l guess so.

603
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:19,217
She's 3.

604
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:22,218
l have a son that age.

605
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,940
You want cigarettes?

606
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:32,276
Not allowed to smoke.

607
00:42:45,252 --> 00:42:47,375
l wanna see my daughter,
where you going?

608
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:49,337
l wanna see my daughter.

609
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:51,624
Right here, man.

610
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:58,049
So...

611
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:01,518
...why the fuck did you get AlDS?

612
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,771
l loved--

613
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:10,352
l loved heroin.

614
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:14,323
lt took me to another body.

615
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:17,864
Made me feel golden.

616
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,406
You?

617
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:24,369
No, l never liked that shit.

618
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:26,540
l sold a lot of it though.

619
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:30,046
Maybe--

620
00:43:30,213 --> 00:43:35,290
Maybe l got mine from you.

621
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:39,049
No, l was never
on the street dealing.

622
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:41,801
Still...

623
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,977
Listen, you little fuck,
l was in the business.

624
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,432
Pure and simple.

625
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,154
l never told you to fucking share
your needles with anybody.

626
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,362
No smoking.

627
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:10,831
- Yo, Ortolani.
- What do you want, Post?

628
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:12,920
l'm gonna be working
in the AlDS ward with you.

629
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:14,958
Great news, huh?

630
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:17,381
Got a extra cig?

631
00:44:18,595 --> 00:44:22,047
- No, no extra.
- Hey, Ortolani.

632
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,057
- How you doing?
- Oh, Christ.

633
00:44:25,602 --> 00:44:29,896
You know, Jesus Christ,
this is like fucking high school.

634
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:33,853
You think by shoving me
in the AlDS ward

635
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:35,812
you gonna change me?

636
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:39,532
Let me tell you something, coach.
Even with all your good intentions,

637
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:44,487
all your reforms, and all your overhaul
policies, l ain't ever gonna change.

638
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:49,283
We ain't ever gonna change.
None of us.

639
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:03,967
Hi, Timmy, what's up?

640
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:16,149
Dino Ortolani.

641
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:18,986
Cancel his conjugal visit.

642
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:24,402
Tell him instead
he can have family time.

643
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,659
Family? He's ltalian.

644
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:28,995
That could mean upwards
of a hundred people.

645
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:32,541
No, no, just his wife and kids.

646
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:35,956
And l want them
to meet behind the glass.

647
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:40,214
l want him to see them,
but no touching.

648
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:43,177
Oh, Tim.

649
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:45,844
- You wanna be careful.
- About what?

650
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:48,975
Of playing God once too often.

651
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:51,804
lf you're not careful,

652
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:55,272
the real one's
gonna get very pissed off.

653
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:08,325
Hi. Thank you, baby.

654
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:10,745
Why don't you go play over there?
Let me talk to Daddy.

655
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:12,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

656
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:16,577
What happened?
Why you got sandbags?

657
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:19,003
l slipped in the shower.

658
00:46:19,716 --> 00:46:21,792
- Be quiet.
- Let them play, they're kids.

659
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,003
Don't keep them cooped up.

660
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:26,677
How you doing, Ginnie?

661
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:30,299
The house is so empty.

662
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:34,350
- They treating you okay?
- Of course.

663
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:38,481
But, babe, the money,
it don't mean nothing to me.

664
00:46:39,945 --> 00:46:42,650
As long as you can take care
of those two, that's what's important.

665
00:46:42,823 --> 00:46:44,981
- l miss you.
- What'd l tell you about that?

666
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,534
- You have to go on with your life.
- l don't wanna hear about that.

667
00:46:48,745 --> 00:46:51,117
You have to go on
with your fucking life, Ginnie.

668
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,282
You have to make
like l'm dead, like l got shot,

669
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,536
- like Mario and Jake.
- What?

670
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:01,589
You want me to find a guy?

671
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,587
You want me to get married again?

672
00:47:04,803 --> 00:47:09,015
You want some guy
watching your kids grow up?

673
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:11,893
Call him Daddy?

674
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:22,976
l don't want you ever bringing them
back here, ever again.

675
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,929
Pussy inmate took the state to court,
said smoking was bad for his health.

676
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:52,008
This whole fucking place
is bad for your health,

677
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:55,350
you know what l'm saying?
The state, they pussies too.

678
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:58,646
Ban cigs in all the prisons. l'm 30 more
years without a fucking cigarette?

679
00:47:58,815 --> 00:48:01,686
No fucking way. They won't even
let the brothers in solitary puff,

680
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,737
like they're worried about catching
fucking lung cancer.

681
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:06,738
You like to hear yourself talk,
don't you?

682
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:09,774
You ever wonder what it's like
to burn someone's eye out?

683
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:12,449
- Oh, yeah.
- Put that out. You, get out of my chair.

684
00:48:13,664 --> 00:48:15,490
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:19,408
- Go take care of Emilio Sanchez.
- What'd he do now?

686
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:22,623
He had an accident.
Change him and then sponge him.

687
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:25,627
No way.
l ain't touching that diseased turd.

688
00:48:25,842 --> 00:48:29,591
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Oh, no, l ain't.

689
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:34,092
Look, Sanchez hasn't got long
and he knows it.

690
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:36,468
l can't do more for him
than dull the pain

691
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:40,980
and the least that you can do
is not let him die lying in his own shit.

692
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:46,356
Okay.

693
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:51,696
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

694
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:00,951
Let's go, Sanchez.

695
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:03,826
l wanna die.

696
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:05,583
Hey, you're gonna get your wish.

697
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,508
Please.

698
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,719
Please, what?

699
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:15,598
Help me.

700
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:22,564
Help you?

701
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:48,626
Here.

702
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,428
Help me die.

703
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:11,688
Fancy meeting you here.

704
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:14,908
Hey, l want you to know, Dino,
l got no hard feelings.

705
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,452
Your goombah tells you to kill me,

706
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,494
you try and make your bones,
l appreciate that.

707
00:50:18,664 --> 00:50:19,992
lt's not your fault l didn't die.

708
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:21,743
lt's not your fault
you'd have the balls

709
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:24,918
to come after me, right?
You run to the D.A., you rat bastard.

710
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:28,378
Now you're trying to provoke me into
a fight, which'll go down on my record,

711
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,998
which'll keep me
from getting a berth in Em City.

712
00:50:33,053 --> 00:50:36,054
- You coming to Em City?
- Yeah, how about that?

713
00:50:36,223 --> 00:50:38,892
You and me, lasagna boy,
side by side

714
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:41,852
every single day
for the rest of our lives.

715
00:50:42,062 --> 00:50:44,138
Unless, of course,
l get paroled in 1 2.

716
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:46,598
- Come to Em City, you're dead.
- l guess that means

717
00:50:46,817 --> 00:50:48,525
l can't use you as a reference, huh?

718
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:56,741
- Fuck. Fuck you. Fucker!
- Eat shit.

719
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:03,784
Shit.

720
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:27,305
You can take a punch, huh?

721
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:29,481
When l have to.

722
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:33,441
Got all the answers, too.

723
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:35,695
No, not all.

724
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:39,159
But some.

725
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:47,958
Yeah, well...

726
00:51:51,506 --> 00:51:54,424
...it's too bad
you're the wrong colour.

727
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:29,500
- What's going on?
- Killed one of my patients.

728
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:32,083
l came in but it was too late already.
He's a monster.

729
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:34,373
You gotta do something.
You gotta stop him.

730
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:40,553
No! No!

731
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:54,067
People kill to stay alive.

732
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:58,028
That's as true in prison as out.

733
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:03,699
But l'm wondering why in here
we fight so hard to stay alive.

734
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:07,862
A man gets sentenced to 1 00 years,
he really thinks if he exercises,

735
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:11,417
gets all buff, stays diesel,
he's gonna walk out?

736
00:53:23,515 --> 00:53:28,011
A judge says life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.

737
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:31,063
Without the possibility.

738
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,897
Lifers.

739
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:36,026
At some point they realise
they ain't going nowhere.

740
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:40,732
l seen it happen.
A calm comes in their eyes.

741
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:42,443
lt's like they figured out something

742
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:45,411
that the rest of us
are never gonna see.

743
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:50,620
They're suddenly free in a whole
other kind of way, they're ready to die.

744
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:54,375
And maybe they do what they can
to help that shit along.
