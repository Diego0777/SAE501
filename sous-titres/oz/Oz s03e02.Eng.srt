1
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,302
Napoleon Bonaparte.

2
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,741
A poor Italian boy who grew up to be
the emperor of the French...

3
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,443
and almost the whole world.

4
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:50,214
Maybe "grew up" is the wrong way to say it,
since he was never taller than 5'2".

5
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,918
But you don't have to be a big man...

6
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,554
to make a big difference.

7
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:15,245
- I'm telling you, Metzger's dead.
- What happened?

8
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,081
Someone cut his throat.

9
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,150
- Who?
- Nobody knows.

10
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:22,449
Then you find out.

11
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:27,088
- I'm glad Metzger's dead.
- He beat me for no reason.

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,459
We may be glad the fucker's gone
till somebody worse takes his place.

13
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,830
Leo, you know the relationship between
the unit manager and the CO supervisor...

14
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:45,036
- has to be one of mutual respect and trust.
- Yes.

15
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:48,414
So I don't want to promote someone
who's already working here.

16
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,315
Someone who already has
their loyalties, their prejudices.

17
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,875
I wanna bring in a CO from the outside.

18
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:57,587
- You know a guy?
- Yes, Sean Murphy. We grew up together.

19
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,182
He's been working the last eight years
at Attica.

20
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,455
I trust him with my life, Leo.

21
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:05,356
In this job, you'll have to.

22
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,860
So is that a "yes"?

23
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,933
- Do I ever say no to you?
- Good...

24
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,669
because he's already on his way.

25
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,049
I don't get these fucking hacks.

26
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,283
One of their own gets offed,
and it's, like, no big deal.

27
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:34,123
No lockdown, no inquiry,
no memorial service.

28
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,760
Maybe they knew Metzger was with us.

29
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,691
Maybe we gotta start
an investigation of our own.

30
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:44,827
Watch your step, asshole.

31
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,002
You spit in my food.

32
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,539
Yeah, no shit. Now sit down here and eat it.

33
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:11,862
Here we go.

34
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,899
Ryan, come on. We're late making breakfast.

35
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,638
I told you, we're not working in the kitchen
this morning.

36
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,237
- I have to go see my lawyer.
- I'm hungry.

37
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:31,941
I can go myself.

38
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:34,582
- No, you can't.
- I'm hungry.

39
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:37,054
Would you quit sweating me, Cyril?

40
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,960
Come on, O'Reily, I need some tits.

41
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,239
- Cyril.
- Hello.

42
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:56,942
Jim Robson. Remember me?

43
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,502
No.

44
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,507
I was in Unit B when you first came into Oz.

45
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,446
I'm buddies with Vern.

46
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:10,483
First time since then
I seen you without your brother.

47
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,957
- Ryan's coming.
- He's no fun.

48
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:16,784
But you and me, we can have some fun.

49
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:21,395
Why don't you give me some of
that sweet pussy I been hearing about?

50
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,195
Knock it off!

51
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,271
- He hit first!
- Get him to the hole!

52
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,604
Back to your unit!

53
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,122
Hey, Gloria.

54
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,983
I just met with my lawyer.

55
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,493
Because I confessed
to having Cyril kill your husband...

56
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:54,122
the D.A. Agreed to only add on 40 years
to my sentence.

57
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,394
Life plus 40 fucking years, Gloria!

58
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,038
All for you.

59
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,741
I wanna see my brother.

60
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,870
Tim, when you called me
about working here, I was...

61
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:43,245
Apprehensive?

62
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:46,080
Oz doesn't exactly have the best reputation
these days.

63
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,086
Yeah, but that's why I want you here.

64
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:51,021
I think you and me together
could turn this place around.

65
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,786
Hey, McManus!

66
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:57,457
- You gotta get my brother out of the hole.
- He hit another inmate.

67
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,364
Come on, you know what that's about.
These Nazi fucks. They taunt him.

68
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,664
Cyril wouldn't provoke a fight,
and you know it.

69
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,262
- Okay.
- This is fucking bullshit!

70
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,672
I said okay. I'll look into it. Now get lost.

71
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,743
- Jesus Christ.
- Who's that?

72
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:15,847
Ryan O'Reily.

73
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,680
- Good Irish mug.
- I don't know about good, but...

74
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,617
I actually saw that little brouhaha,
and it got me thinking.

75
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,089
At Attica, you organized
a boxing program, right?

76
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,649
- Yeah.
- Maybe we could try that here.

77
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:28,887
Great.

78
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:33,896
All we need is time, gloves,
and a good insurance policy.

79
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:39,397
Each group, the Muslims,
the Irish, the Italians, whatever...

80
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,803
will promote one boxer.

81
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,537
Then we'll have a series of elimination bouts
until there are two finalists.

82
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:48,377
- Then we'll have the big championship bout.
- Organized violence?

83
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:50,973
- It's worked in other prisons, Ray.
- No, he's right.

84
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,518
Whether it's rodeo or baseball...

85
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:58,387
sporting events focus the inmates'
aggression in a very positive way.

86
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,518
It's not their aggression
I'm concerned about. It's the gambling.

87
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,585
You start this, the bets will be all over.

88
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,528
It's already all over the place, Leo.

89
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,364
These guys bet on everything
from the Super Bowl to tic-tac-fucking-toe.

90
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,632
I mean, it's not like drugs.
It's not hurting anyone.

91
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,606
Let's see if the Commissioner signs off.

92
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,678
- I've done some boxing before.
- Me, too.

93
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,048
Where, at the Special Olympics?

94
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,747
My brother Cyril
was a Golden Gloves champ.

95
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,653
- There gonna be a purse?
- No.

96
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:34,159
- Then what's the point?
- For the greater glory of your tribe.

97
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,758
That's right. Hit that fucker! Hit it! Harder!

98
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,257
Jab-jab-right.

99
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,889
<i>Napoleon once said...</i>

100
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,898
<i>that men are more easily governed</i>
<i>by their vices than their virtues.</i>

101
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,627
<i>One, two, three...</i>

102
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:20,966
<i>five, six, seven, eight...</i>

103
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,203
<i>That's it.</i>

104
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:29,981
He also said:

105
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,712
"There is only one step
from the sublime to the ridiculous."

106
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:35,648
Napoleon must have known Tim McManus.

107
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,517
Yo, McManus.

108
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,895
Coyle, got your new work assignment.
Barbershop.

109
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,765
What's up with that, McManus?
Snake work in the kitchen with me.

110
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,964
Gee, I thought I was still running this unit.

111
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,133
I told you to stop calling me Kenny.
My name is Bricks.

112
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,066
Bricks. Right.

113
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,644
This is Nappa's doing.

114
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,646
- Think so?
- I'm sure.

115
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:07,777
Dago's got a hair across
his wrinkly ass for me.

116
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:22,200
- Yo, Nappa.
- Get those bottles out of here, pronto.

117
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,396
Yo, Nappa. <i>Italiano</i>.

118
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,010
It's Mr. Nappa.

119
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:35,741
- Why you take Snake out the kitchen?
- Wasn't me.

120
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:39,678
McManus had his own plans for the boy.

121
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,614
Get him to change his mind.

122
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:44,851
There are some things
not even I am capable of.

123
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,017
Get the fuck outta here. That's bullshit.

124
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:51,894
Okay, I don't like him.
I don't trust your little pal Coyle.

125
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,254
I do.

126
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,496
Then the two of you can cuddle
in the privacy of your cell...

127
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,231
but he's not working in my cafeteria.

128
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,940
Are we clear on that, Bricks?

129
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,735
Now get to work.

130
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,277
So your father was a barber?

131
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:12,707
Yeah, I cut my teeth watching him cut hair.

132
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,345
Good. I could use some real help
around here.

133
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:16,410
The guys they send me...

134
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,856
don't know the difference
between a Princeton and a bowl cut.

135
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,058
How's that?

136
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,296
- Nice.
- Yeah? Good.

137
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:31,094
- Anything else?
- Wouldn't mind a shave.

138
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,139
I wouldn't mind a blowjob
from Neve Campbell.

139
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,573
Yo, I'll shave him. I need the practice.

140
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:40,134
Suit yourself, chief.
I'm going up to the roof and have a smoke.

141
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:49,050
White folks, man, they're so dumb.
Daddy wasn't no goddamn barber.

142
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,654
You paralyzed, right?

143
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,085
I don't want you running away on me.

144
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,263
- Sharp.
- Coyle.

145
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,635
- Call me Snake.
- I changed my mind, man.

146
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,675
What? Ain't nothing like a clean shave,
a close shave.

147
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:13,143
Don't squirm,
you're gonna make me nick your neck.

148
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,407
So what you in here for, Augustus?

149
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,676
Murder. I killed a cop.

150
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,710
Sweet. But I got you beat.

151
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,985
I whacked a whole family:

152
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:28,118
Mama, daddy...

153
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,828
two little sweet, adorable kids...

154
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,628
sweet old gramps.

155
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,263
What'd this family do to you?

156
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:40,563
Not a thing.

157
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,972
- Then why you kill 'em?
- For fun.

158
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:47,039
- And how you kill 'em?
- Take a guess.

159
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,645
You slit their throats.

160
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,086
- Why you fucking with me, man?
- I ain't fucking with you.

161
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:56,417
You up in Oz for armed robbery.

162
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,387
That I am.
I never got caught for the murders.

163
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,596
- And never will.
- Give me my wheelchair, man.

164
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:08,094
Yes, sir. Yes, master. We aim to please.

165
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,166
You clowns remember
a couple of months back...

166
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,837
a family named Ciancimino
getting slaughtered?

167
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:55,642
Yes, as I recall,
the murders were particularly brutal.

168
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,478
And they never found the killer.

169
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,347
- I think I have.
- Who?

170
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,479
Never mind who.
He told me he did it, the fuck.

171
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:05,950
- You know the family?
- No.

172
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,318
Then why you so bent out of shape?

173
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:12,091
Listen, I ain't no saint. Not even close.
I killed somebody.

174
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:16,332
I did one wrong thing, taking a life.
And I'm doing time for it, you know.

175
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,199
Seth, toss that down here.

176
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:24,172
This fuck has got no remorse.

177
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:28,970
He took those lives for pure pleasure.
He had no reason to kill.

178
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,112
And he's getting away with it.

179
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:34,651
Kids today.
There's no honor, no ethics, no values.

180
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:37,721
That's 'cause no one's willing
to stop the erosion.

181
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,281
No one has a vested interest
in justice anymore.

182
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:43,954
Those two kids...
One was only 18 months old.

183
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,592
Lunch!

184
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:57,436
I got conflicting codes here.
Number one: I'm not a rat.

185
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:04,272
And two: I keep thinking about those kids
not having a chance at a life.

186
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:08,981
If those were my kids,
I'd want somebody to speak for them.

187
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:11,916
Then you have to be sure. And are you?

188
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,384
Are you sure that he murdered them?

189
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:18,723
Yeah.

190
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,668
I haven't spent that much time
around Coyle.

191
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:26,831
He doesn't strike me as a man that's honest.
As a poser, as a braggart, yes.

192
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,499
A man that's trying to get credit
he hasn't earned.

193
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,373
Just like Jiggy Walker. You remember him?

194
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,375
Then I should what?

195
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:38,715
Talk to him.

196
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,683
Get him to tell you the full story.

197
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:45,815
- And if I think he's telling the truth?
- That's when it gets hard.

198
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,217
You have to convince him to confess.

199
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,045
I'm fucking the wife, right?
Her throat gurgling for air...

200
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,412
the baby over here, crying in the crib.

201
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:14,613
So I gots to pull out of the bitch,
blood everywhere. I mean, all over.

202
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,549
So I go lean into the little fucker...

203
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:32,228
Stabbed it right in the heart.

204
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:35,706
Goddamn! You sick motherfucker, damn!

205
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:38,107
Yo, you should turn yourself in.

206
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,009
No, think about it. Think on it.

207
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,673
Your shit'd be famous, yo.

208
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:48,186
You'd be name in the paper, picture on TV.
You'd be like Manson up here.

209
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,814
Yeah, and I'd be moving
straight to death row.

210
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,654
- No thanks, homey.
- Nigger, you full of shit.

211
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,387
You doubting my word, nigger?

212
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,624
There used to be a nigger up here,
what's his name, Jiggy Walker?

213
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:02,896
Big-ass talker. He came here saying he sold
drugs to the governor.

214
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,835
The whole nine, lying through
his gold-ass teeth. Look at you.

215
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:09,466
Fuck you, fuck this Jiggy nigger.
I don't care. I ain't lying.

216
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,978
All I'm saying is,
you ain't lying, give me proof.

217
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,807
- I got proof.
- Right.

218
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:19,678
I got a videotape.

219
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,911
Get the fuck outta here.

220
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:24,717
Remember my homey Franklin,
up there in Polo Ground?

221
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:28,515
He came with me,
minicamed the whole dark deed.

222
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,395
- Sick motherfucker.
- When I do it, I do it!

223
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:32,726
Goddamn!

224
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,197
Yo, that's a tape I wanna see.

225
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,664
- Me, too, yo.
- Goddamn.

226
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:43,800
- I'd like to see that shit.
- Your ass need to be in here, motherfucker.

227
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,772
There's no deal to be made here, Hill.

228
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:49,406
- You get nothing out of this.
- He knows.

229
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,781
Coyle will deny everything.
His word versus yours.

230
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:58,381
- There's a videotape that a friend of his has.
- Christ.

231
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,620
I'll call the D.A.

232
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:03,721
What you're doing takes balls.

233
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:09,328
Still hope I have mine after this is over,
you know what I'm saying?

234
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,065
Damn.

235
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,659
Our man Napoleon
conquered a lot of places...

236
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:45,795
created a lot of laws that we still use today,
and made his mark on history.

237
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:49,307
And what does he get for it?
They name a dessert after him.

238
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:53,136
They named a beef after Wellington.
Fucking Caesar got a salad.

239
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:57,672
But Napoleon? He's on the tray with sweets,
next to the crème brûlée.

240
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:02,418
<i>On behalf of the 8 inmates</i>
<i>who were killed, and the 20 injured...</i>

241
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:05,848
<i>I am filing a class-action suit</i>
<i>against the Governor...</i>

242
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:10,422
<i>the Department of Corrections,</i>
<i>and the Oswald Correctional Facility.</i>

243
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,554
Yeah, motherfucker!

244
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,665
<i>We believe excessive force was used</i>
<i>by the prison administration...</i>

245
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,105
<i>violating my client's civil rights.</i>

246
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,838
<i>We are therefore looking for damages</i>
<i>at $45 million.</i>

247
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:29,506
<i>From the state courthouse,</i>
<i>Rick Donn for</i> Channel 2 News.

248
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:33,545
- The ghost of Scott Ross rears its head.
- Nobody knows you shot him.

249
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,213
But if there's a trial,
they'll be digging up shit again.

250
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,951
- Maybe this time they'll find out.
- Maybe the state will settle out of court.

251
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:43,984
- Devlin won't settle. That will admit guilt.
- Maybe it's time to tell the truth.

252
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:47,328
Tim, if they find out I murdered Scott Ross,
I go to jail.

253
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,457
Maybe.

254
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:52,261
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe because of the circumstances...

255
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:55,432
'cause I got a 10-year-old daughter,
a dying mother...

256
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,408
Maybe they'll only fire me.

257
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,569
And you, for lying.

258
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:04,410
Do either of us want to take that risk?

259
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,319
Respect.

260
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,316
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.

261
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:15,417
- Everyone is recharged.
- Dinner!

262
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:19,286
- Let's go eat.
- Actually, I can't. I have a visitor.

263
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,392
Who, the lawyer?

264
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,199
Tricia Ross.

265
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,500
Again? She's already agreed
to be part of the lawsuit.

266
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:30,471
- Why do you need to see her a second time?
- She asked for spiritual counseling.

267
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:32,568
Then send her to a priest.

268
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:36,309
Minister Said, with all due respect...

269
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:39,883
Schillinger's telling everyone
you're attracted to the girl.

270
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:43,388
Don't you think seeing her again
might get misconstrued?

271
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,582
Then let it be misconstrued.

272
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:49,494
I know my heart is pure.

273
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,108
- What's that mean?
- It's just a greeting.

274
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:14,046
I gotta tell you,
ever since the announcement...

275
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,853
I've become sort of a celebrity.

276
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,654
Yes. Everywhere I go...

277
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,125
beauty parlor, Wal-Mart...

278
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:27,396
people I know say they saw me on the news.

279
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,891
I have something for you...

280
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,335
somewhere.

281
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,904
I wanted you to have this.

282
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,306
I can't accept that.

283
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:51,112
No, in Emerald City we're not permitted
to have such personal items.

284
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,151
Maybe you could...

285
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,523
just hide it under your pillow then.

286
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,668
<i>"Tell the believing men...</i>

287
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,441
"to lower their gaze
and guard their sexuality.

288
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,709
"That is pure for them.

289
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,413
"Indeed...

290
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,213
"God is aware of what they do."

291
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:25,320
Sexual desire is a powerful part
of human nature.

292
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:27,955
Am I right, Minister?

293
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,618
Yes.

294
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:34,127
Such desire needs only the slightest
encouragement to become ignited.

295
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,698
Am I right?

296
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:39,526
Yes.

297
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:42,832
In Islam, we believe eliminating temptation...

298
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:45,934
is more effective than trying to resist it.

299
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:49,102
Yes.

300
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:53,474
That is why men and women
who are not married, or <i>mahrem</i>...

301
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,812
are forbidden to interact with one another...

302
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,816
or be alone together.

303
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,859
Am I right?

304
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,400
Yes, Arif.

305
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,763
You are right.

306
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,044
<i>We Muslims believe</i>
<i>that appetites of the body...</i>

307
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:26,676
<i>such as food, drink, sex...</i>

308
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:32,348
can tie us to a dependency on,
or preoccupation with, our physical desires.

309
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:36,323
Therefore we fast,
denying ourselves those needs...

310
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,658
while we strengthen our spiritual nature.

311
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:45,335
If you're asking me for permission to fast,
I don't care.

312
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:48,235
- Stop eating.
- It's more complex than that.

313
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:51,868
According to the revelations of the Prophet,
praise be on him...

314
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:54,572
I am only allowed to abstain
during daylight hours.

315
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,944
At sunset, I must break my fast.

316
00:23:57,182 --> 00:24:00,811
I must also have a pre-dawn meal
before resuming my fast the next day.

317
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,684
But at sunset and pre-dawn
you're in lockdown.

318
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:05,017
Exactly.

319
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,651
Which is why I need your consent
to have food in my cell.

320
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:13,289
This isn't Burger King.
You can't have it your way.

321
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:15,890
You don't deserve special treatment.

322
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:20,729
- Of course.
- But I would be willing to make a trade.

323
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,499
- Drop the lawsuit.
- I'm not alone in the lawsuit, McManus.

324
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:28,335
Not up to me.

325
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,438
Bullshit. You instigated this.

326
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:33,576
You convinced them to sue.
Now tell them not to.

327
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:38,412
Why do you care, McManus?
You're not even named as a defendant.

328
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,159
I want to put this riot behind us.

329
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:46,497
We must never allow anybody
to forget those three days.

330
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,691
Right now, we're on the edge of oblivion.

331
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,998
We're on the brink of disaster.

332
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:55,663
Now before we all join hands and jump...

333
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,875
I want another chance. Wait.

334
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,846
I won't allow you
to forget the promise you made.

335
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:07,908
I haven't.

336
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,887
Then you permit me to fast
according to the tenets of my faith?

337
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:11,980
No.

338
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:17,588
Denying me my rights
to practice my religion is unconstitutional.

339
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,598
Yeah? What are you gonna do?
File another lawsuit?

340
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,655
No.

341
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,831
You won't permit me to fast...

342
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,196
I will go on a hunger strike.

343
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,200
You were right about Tim McManus.

344
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:33,836
He's dreamy.

345
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:36,847
I don't recall ever saying
Tim McManus was dreamy.

346
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,480
- We've been going out.
- Yeah?

347
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:46,917
Let me guess.
First he took you to Al's Diner on Chisholm.

348
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,753
He told you that his dad owned a diner
up near Attica...

349
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,230
how living outside that prison
changed his life.

350
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,125
Second date he canceled, too much work.

351
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:01,195
And then he took you to Ma Plume Blanche,
at Top of the Tower.

352
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,840
The two of you sat
watching the city all sparkle.

353
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,173
He said he had feelings for you.

354
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:11,307
And then you went back to his apartment
and fucked.

355
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,749
Actually, we fucked after the diner.

356
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:21,586
- Speak of the horny little devil.
- Diane, can I talk to you alone?

357
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:27,190
Sparkle, why the long face?

358
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,298
I just talked to the hospital.

359
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:37,037
They've been trying to reach you all day.

360
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:40,371
Your mother died.

361
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,378
I'm sorry.

362
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:48,845
It's okay. She's been sick a long time.
You know, we've been expecting this.

363
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:51,948
Boy.

364
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,820
Is there anything I can do?

365
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:58,556
No, I gotta go over to the hospital
and start funeral arrangements.

366
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,291
Can you get someone to cover my shift?

367
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:01,730
- It's already done.
- Thanks, Tim.

368
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,963
- Can I drive you?
- I got my car. I gotta pick up my daughter.

369
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:06,834
- I can do that.
- No...

370
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:10,603
I think she should be with me.
I want to tell her.

371
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,825
Napoleon was a great seducer
of beautiful and taller women.

372
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,958
He once said, "In war, as in love...

373
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:37,593
"one must meet in close quarters
to get things over with."

374
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:40,862
There ain't no closer quarters
than in Oz, baby.

375
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,698
Hey.

376
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:46,366
Hi.

377
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:50,444
- Hear from Diane?
- Yeah, she called a couple of minutes ago.

378
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:51,709
How's she doing?

379
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,113
How do you think? She's a mess.

380
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:59,657
Strange, given the fact
her mother's been dying for what, a year?

381
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,492
I found a great restaurant for us.

382
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:09,523
- Rubiletta. It's a new Italian place.
- I'm gonna have to cancel.

383
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:12,770
I promised Diane
I'd come by the funeral home.

384
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,261
Okay.

385
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,601
You said it was over between you two.

386
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,277
It is. We're friends.

387
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:26,516
Doesn't seem that way.
Today, in the lounge...

388
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:29,753
Her mother had just died.

389
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:33,689
I saw the way you were holding her.
That was more than comfort.

390
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,755
Don't laugh at me!

391
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,631
Claire, what the fuck
are we talking about here?

392
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:44,100
- You and Diane, you and me.
- There is no me and Diane.

393
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,933
And to be perfectly honest,
there is no you and me!

394
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,064
- We went out twice!
- No, we fucked twice!

395
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,735
- So what?
- You said you had feelings for me.

396
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,438
I did, but if you're gonna turn into
some cloying bitch...

397
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:57,243
I'm a fucking cloying bitch, is that it?

398
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,215
And they're fucking...

399
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,987
- Calm down!
- Let go of me.

400
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,117
- Stop it!
- Get off me!

401
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,385
Let go of me!

402
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:13,124
- Are you gonna calm down?
- Let go of me.

403
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:15,960
Let go!

404
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,569
- You're gonna get yourself fired.
- Fuck you!

405
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,284
- Yeah, can I help you?
- We're here to see my son, Carlo Ricardo.

406
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,490
Okay. Step through to the admitting office.

407
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,963
Where's Mommy?
She doesn't still have the flu, does she?

408
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,527
No, she's at choir practice.

409
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,836
You know how Father Annas is
about missing practice.

410
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,009
You're in the choir.

411
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:07,348
I quit. I've been busy with the baby and all.

412
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:11,852
Sergio?

413
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:14,448
He's working.

414
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:20,454
Sergio doesn't want
to come here anymore, son.

415
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,256
Mommy?

416
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,129
I'm not gonna lie to you.
She doesn't want to see you like this.

417
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,036
I understand.

418
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,135
Come on,
it doesn't mean she doesn't love you.

419
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:35,645
I understand.

420
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,487
Isabella, you got any pictures of the baby?

421
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,525
So Cohn says to me,
with the shank in his hand:

422
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:56,567
"I stuck it in his head, but I didn't kill him."

423
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,572
Was there ever a time you were afraid?

424
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,870
One time? How about every time?

425
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:07,501
Just because I'm not down on the floor
anymore with you men and women...

426
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:12,482
it doesn't mean I don't whisper a prayer
every time I walk through the fucking gates.

427
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:21,092
I'm going home. If I'm late for dinner again,
my wife's gonna tan my ass.

428
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,751
Thanks for the drink, sir.

429
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,820
- Good night.
- Everybody, travel safe.

430
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,891
- Want something, Clayton?
- I should drive you home.

431
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:34,530
- What are you saying, I had one too many?
- Two too many.

432
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,099
I also want to talk to you about something...

433
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,575
and since you got a buzz going,
now's my best chance.

434
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:41,635
What, you gonna complain?
You just started.

435
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:44,238
No, the salary's fine.
It's being in the lobby all day.

436
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:47,376
I didn't train to be a CO
to sit behind a reception desk.

437
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,046
- I want to be assigned to a cell block.
- No.

438
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,316
What'd I tell you
when you applied for the job?

439
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:56,087
I promised your father, as he was dying,
that I'd take care of you.

440
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:59,255
I'm not letting you
anywhere near the prisoners.

441
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,264
Then I quit.

442
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:07,170
I'll go get a job in another prison
where they'll let me deal with the inmates.

443
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:11,167
What are you trying to prove?
That you're as tough as your dad?

444
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:14,701
He died in here,
his heart bleeding in my arms.

445
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:19,045
- I'm not going through that with you.
- I'm not 10 years old anymore, Leo.

446
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,078
You can't stop me.

447
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,728
We'll figure this out tomorrow, okay?

448
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,961
Give me the keys.

449
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:44,772
No, I can drive myself.
This conversation just sobered me up.

450
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:55,413
What the fuck you doing? Stop that!

451
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,288
You ain't so bad now, huh?

452
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,630
- Come on.
- Get back there.

453
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,362
Now who's the man? Fuck you!

454
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:12,792
Who?

455
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,008
Take him to the hole!

456
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:24,976
You okay?

457
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:29,717
- Go to the hospital, get yourself checked up.
- I'm okay.

458
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,825
- What's this about?
- Motherfucking spic is crazy.

459
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,623
Mumbling some shit about his mother, man.

460
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,161
What the fuck you looking at?

461
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,753
Napoleon's final defeat came at Waterloo.

462
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,096
Must've been embarrassing.

463
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,531
You're the fucking emperor.
You conquered Europe...

464
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:20,093
only to lose in a place
with a stupid name like Waterloo...

465
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,671
or Watergate, or Whitewater.

466
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:26,233
Note to politicians: Stay on land.

467
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:29,778
<i>Larry, ever since we reinstituted</i>
<i>the death penalty...</i>

468
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,282
<i>the courts have been clogged</i>
<i>with needless appeals...</i>

469
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,116
<i>by convicted murderers</i>
<i>trying to escape their rightful punishment.</i>

470
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:38,314
<i>So the legislature has agreed...</i>

471
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:42,690
<i>to reduce fees paid</i>
<i>to court-appointed lawyers in murder cases.</i>

472
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,958
<i>And some of these lawyers,</i>
<i>who are against capital punishment...</i>

473
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,931
<i>have been padding their bills</i>
<i>in order to say:</i>

474
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,195
<i>"You see, it's too expensive."</i>

475
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:57,165
<i>I say let them take advantage of taxpayers</i>
<i>somewhere else.</i>

476
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,839
The court rejected our appeal.

477
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:02,770
So what's the next step?

478
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:06,177
Normally, the next step, the last step...

479
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,549
is the State Supreme Court.

480
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,349
Let's do that then.

481
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:14,014
What's the matter, Lawrence?

482
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:17,055
I'm recusing myself as your attorney.

483
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:18,520
What?

484
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,727
Why? Was it something I said?
Something I did?

485
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:26,134
Not at all.

486
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:30,808
It's just that with these new lower fees
that the state's paying...

487
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:34,504
I can't afford to work on your defense.

488
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:37,274
Murder cases are complicated.
They take a lot of time...

489
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:41,216
and I've been neglecting
the rest of my practice.

490
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:45,653
- What'll happen to me then?
- The court will appoint you another lawyer.

491
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:48,282
One that won't be as good.

492
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:51,284
Because the ones that take the jobs
at lower rates...

493
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:54,661
- are the ones that no one else will hire.
- I'm sorry.

494
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,882
- Oh, my.
- What's the matter, Shirley?

495
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:27,463
It just hit me for the first time.

496
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,556
I'm gonna die.

497
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:40,909
- Hi, Dad.
- Vern, I've got bad news.

498
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:43,508
It's the only kind of news you ever got.

499
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:47,278
- Andy has been arrested.
- Christ. For what?

500
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:50,720
I don't know.
Drugs, beating up some nigger.

501
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:54,852
- The lawyer's trying to sort it out.
- Which lawyer? Don't use Zanger.

502
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:56,917
No, the court-appointed lawyer.

503
00:36:56,995 --> 00:37:00,260
What, a public defender?
Hire a real fucking attorney, Dad!

504
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,265
I don't have the money, Vern.

505
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,961
I talked to the P.D. On the phone.
She sounds smart.

506
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:06,128
She?

507
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:10,566
- What's her name?
- I don't know. I think it's Goldberg.

508
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:15,312
Jesus fucking Christ, Dad.
I need you to take care of this.

509
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,644
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

510
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:21,776
And I'm gonna tell you one thing,
I ain't throwing good money after bad.

511
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:24,151
And your two boys are bad.

512
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,151
The apple doesn't fall very far.

513
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,166
You wanted to see me?

514
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,808
I gotta get out of this place.

515
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,145
There's a reason
you're in protective custody.

516
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:55,185
We want you to live long enough
to testify against Schillinger.

517
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:58,586
Warden, I stay in here, I die of boredom.

518
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,122
You wanted magazines, I sent magazines.

519
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:04,827
How many times a day can a guy jerk off?

520
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:08,829
- I don't know. Depends on the guy.
- I gotta go back to Em City.

521
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,358
I ain't worried about Schillinger.
I'll take care of myself.

522
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:15,429
I want that fuck to see that
I'm not punking out.

523
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,801
- What the fuck is she wearing for a bra?
- Hey, Keller. Back so soon?

524
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:22,945
Ain't no Miss Sally in protective custody.

525
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,165
Don't.

526
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:59,839
You realize we've only kissed once?

527
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:06,282
In all these months, once.

528
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:12,122
All I've been thinking about
is kissing you again.

529
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:13,891
I said don't.

530
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,297
I did what you asked!

531
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:20,994
I ratted out Schillinger and Metzger.
Do you know what that means?

532
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:25,439
Toby, you know what that cost me?

533
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:30,373
Unless this is just another scheme
you and Schillinger cooked up.

534
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,980
How am I supposed to trust you?

535
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,319
Put myself in that position again?

536
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,812
Be that vulnerable again?

537
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,484
Keller knows if he fucks with me,
he's a dead man.

538
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:30,096
Yo!

539
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:44,018
If you're coming, motherfucker,
come on and bring it!

540
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:07,467
I need that plasma right away.

541
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:11,376
We need to start an IV. I need
some vaseline gauze and some combine.

542
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,175
Jesus. I think he may have
a punctured lung.

543
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,918
Mr. Keller's got about
three or four assholes now.

544
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:42,740
You asked to be assigned
to the kitchen again.

545
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:45,749
Now you're saying
you don't want to work there?

546
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:49,446
There's too many bad memories,
bad feelings.

547
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,280
Nappa, Wangler...

548
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,261
They don't trust me. I don't trust them.

549
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:02,797
I don't want to fall back into my old ways.

550
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,561
The dress factory
is always looking for new workers.

551
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:07,661
No.

552
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,999
If I can,
I would like to work in the AIDS ward.

553
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,579
We don't get many volunteers
for the AIDS ward.

554
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,116
In Africa, AIDS is much worse than here.

555
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:24,148
I would like to learn something
about the disease...

556
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:26,316
so maybe someday...

557
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,090
I can help my people.

558
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:41,763
These men
are in the final stages of the disease.

559
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,932
You can't do more
than make them comfortable...

560
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,999
and treat them with dignity.

561
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:49,569
Robbie Garth needs his medicine, Bed 7.

562
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,893
- Who are you?
- Adebisi. Take this.

563
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,694
Yummy.

564
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:20,609
I didn't come to Oz with AIDS.
I caught it like the brass ring.

565
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:25,381
You ever fuck anybody up the ass?

566
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,150
- Yes.
- Were you protected?

567
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:31,178
No.

568
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:35,853
Dr. Nathan asked me
to take some more blood from you.

569
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:39,363
- She just took my blood a minute ago.
- She dropped it.

570
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,285
Adebisi, you just pinch me?

571
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:12,457
No, boss.

572
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,971
History tells us
that Napoleon was the first guy to utter:

573
00:44:21,038 --> 00:44:23,768
"If you want something done right,
do it yourself."

574
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:25,603
But how can we be sure?

575
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:29,476
What if old Napoleon's butcher said it
to him, while slicing up some salami...

576
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:33,142
and Napoleon, being no dummy, said,
"I gotta write that down"?

577
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,611
Miguel Alvarez is showing
increased signs of agitation...

578
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:11,314
- since Dr. Garvey took him off Zoloft.
- That's no surprise.

579
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:15,450
And I can't say for sure,
but he really looks thinner.

580
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:18,994
I doubt that's a reaction to the withdrawal.

581
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:22,191
You don't suppose
Dr. Garvey would change his mind...

582
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:24,564
and put Alvarez back on anti-depressants?

583
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:27,627
No. He's not a doctor, he's a walking ledger.

584
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:32,439
Every decision he makes is based on
maintaining the HMO's profit margin.

585
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,769
I have an interview with him
in a few minutes...

586
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:38,576
during which he'll decide
whether or not he wants to keep me on staff.

587
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:40,446
What are you saying?

588
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,287
I'm saying it may be time to go.

589
00:45:44,622 --> 00:45:47,489
- Dr. Nathan, Rebadow's awake.
- Thank you.

590
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,688
What's going on with Rebadow?

591
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,752
He went into insulin shock.
He's got diabetes.

592
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:54,826
Diabetes?

593
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,596
- I don't have diabetes.
- You do now.

594
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:02,197
This happens sometimes, later in life.

595
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:05,332
Body starts shutting down.

596
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:11,678
You'll have to take injections regularly,
go on dialysis weekly, and alter your diet.

597
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,249
Mom's fudge.

598
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:19,380
My mother makes the best fudge.
She sends me a batch once a month.

599
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:26,161
I guess you'll have to be satisfied
with the food in the cafeteria.

600
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,391
Let's see...

601
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:34,327
you've worked here at Oswald
almost two years.

602
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:37,131
Do you like working here?

603
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:41,943
If you're asking me whether I enjoy myself,
I'd have to say no.

604
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,312
- Then why do you want to stay?
- Because what we do here is important.

605
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:50,184
There's a real need for proper health care.

606
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:52,984
Yeah, proper health care. Not excessive.

607
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:58,024
I know you don't support
the privatization of the system here at Oz.

608
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:00,723
But by paying Weigert a fixed rate...

609
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:05,392
no matter what care the inmate requires,
the state reduces its costs.

610
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:07,698
But because Weigert gets paid
the same amount...

611
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:09,932
no matter what treatment we prescribe...

612
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:14,808
wouldn't you limit my ability to call in
specialists, or to use expensive tests?

613
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:17,939
This is no different than HMOs
in the public sector.

614
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,915
There is a difference.

615
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:24,411
The state has laws to protect consumers
against cuts in medical services.

616
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:26,012
There are no such laws for inmates.

617
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,253
Weigert has no incentive
to provide quality care.

618
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,626
We're both doctors.
I took the same oath you did.

619
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:36,731
Then why cut Miguel Alvarez's
anti-depressants?

620
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:41,964
Because, as I told you,
I consider this unnecessary care.

621
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:45,598
And if you hadn't spent too much money
on unnecessary care...

622
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:48,201
the state wouldn't have had to bring us in.

623
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:51,646
- Alvarez is suicidal.
- Maybe it's all for the best.

624
00:47:52,316 --> 00:47:53,374
What?

625
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,510
God knows he's not doing anyone
any good alive.

626
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:58,950
Fuck you.

627
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:04,355
This interview is over.
I'm hereby giving you two weeks' notice.

628
00:48:05,896 --> 00:48:08,057
Knock yourself out, asshole.

629
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:18,363
Hi.

630
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:21,101
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

631
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:24,674
Do I look especially gullible to you today?

632
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:27,876
You hide a sandwich under your vestments,
which you never wear...

633
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:31,752
- and I'm supposed to think it's SOP?
- Pete, I can't talk about it.

634
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:36,086
Some confidentiality
between you and a prisoner.

635
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,889
I'm doing solitary.

636
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:41,458
There's four Catholics
currently residing in solitary.

637
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:44,023
There's O'Brien, there's Bevilaqua...

638
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:45,762
Hevern...

639
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:47,993
Alvarez.

640
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,405
You're bringing food that he likes
to cheer him up.

641
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,879
No, because then
there's no confidentiality problem.

642
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:59,814
You're bringing food to Alvarez...

643
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:04,879
because he's not being fed.

644
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,891
Because of what he did to Officer Rivera...

645
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:12,860
the COs in solitary are trying to starve him.

646
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:19,058
You should've been a cop.

647
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:23,707
Did Alvarez tell you this?
How do you know he's telling the truth?

648
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:24,763
Why would he lie?

649
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:28,437
Some prisoners, particularly in solitary,
become delusional, paranoid.

650
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:32,278
How do I find out if they're feeding him?
If I ask them, and it's true...

651
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:35,113
they'll just find another way
to fuck with him.

652
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,287
I have to give him the benefit of the doubt.

653
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:42,219
What's with the dress?
High Holy Day or something?

654
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:58,938
Give us some privacy.

655
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:10,084
Here, eat.

656
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,279
I'm not hungry.

657
00:50:13,457 --> 00:50:17,120
What do you mean you're not hungry?
You said you haven't eaten in two days.

658
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:20,220
Take the damn sandwich!

659
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:23,698
I don't want the fucking sandwich!
Fuck you, you fuck!

660
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:29,800
Come on. Out!

661
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:35,505
Stop it. Open this door!

662
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:37,644
For God's sake!

663
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:42,508
I think Keller will live.

664
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,551
I'll start an inquiry,
try to figure out who stabbed him.

665
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,750
I got a guess. Schillinger.

666
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:51,654
- We need proof.
- Leo, excuse me.

667
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:54,526
We need to do more than that.

668
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:59,332
We need to deal with the ongoing violence
we have here between inmates...

669
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:02,167
- and between inmates and COs.
- Good luck.

670
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:05,898
Wait a minute.
What if we were to initiate a program...

671
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,245
where victims of violence,
prisoner or staff...

672
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,780
get to interact with the offender.

673
00:51:12,316 --> 00:51:15,911
- Sorry I'm late.
- Interact? That sounds a little New Age.

674
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:19,786
Hear me out. The process has to be initiated
by the victim.

675
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:24,184
We can't force either party to participate
unless they want to.

676
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:28,360
If both parties agree,
I will meet with them separately...

677
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:32,664
and talk about what they might be getting
out of this eventual interaction.

678
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:35,364
And only then, when they're both ready...

679
00:51:35,439 --> 00:51:38,033
do they actually get to meet face to face.

680
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:40,906
And then what? Talk about their feelings?

681
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:45,246
Yeah, the victim expresses his fear,
his anger, whatever.

682
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:48,216
And the offender gets to express
his remorse, or whatever.

683
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:51,550
And, hopefully, they can both move on.

684
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:55,358
I think it's a great idea.
I just wish that I'd thought of it.

685
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,040
Alvarez, what?

686
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,974
Leo, I want Sister Pete's new program
to start...

687
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,741
with Eugene Rivera and Miguel Alvarez.

688
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:22,043
Really?

689
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:24,587
She'll talk to Alvarez,
then she'll contact Rivera...

690
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:27,385
and see if he's interested. And if he is...

691
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,086
I want you to release Miguel from solitary.

692
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:34,858
You know,
I heard about what happened today.

693
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:39,494
I'd think that'd be enough to convince you
that Alvarez is where he belongs.

694
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:41,730
Besides, the other COs wouldn't like it.

695
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:44,330
- You can override them.
- I agree with them.

696
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:48,276
Alvarez blinded a fellow officer.
He should rot.

697
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:52,042
The next act of violence that he commits
will be to himself.

698
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:55,282
We are a heartbeat away
from having no heartbeat at all.

699
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:56,544
So be it.

700
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,589
Leo, I know that you and Miguel
had some rough moments...

701
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,886
after your daughter was raped.

702
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:04,687
He knows who did it and he won't tell.

703
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:08,026
I thought you'd put those feelings aside.

704
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,260
So did I, Father.

705
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:15,838
I guess we were both wrong.

706
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:20,605
<i>When Napoleon died in exile,</i>
<i>the doctors cut off his dick.</i>

707
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:29,614
<i>They put his dick in an ornate box</i>
<i>and gave it to his priest.</i>

708
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,616
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

709
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:39,095
<i>Over the years, Napoleon's dick was sold</i>
<i>and sold again to the highest bidder.</i>

710
00:53:46,503 --> 00:53:50,462
To this day, at least three people
claim to own Napoleon's dick.

711
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:54,632
But you see,
it's not important who owns the real dick.

712
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:58,376
The big question is:

713
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:03,743
Who the fuck
do those other two dicks belong to?
