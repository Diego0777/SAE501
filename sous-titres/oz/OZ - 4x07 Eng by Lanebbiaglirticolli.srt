1
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,978
Some big high roller
once said,

2
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:42,379
the business of america
is business.

3
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,146
And l'm happy to report
the criminal justice business

4
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,016
is booming.

5
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,645
Heavy industry headed south,

6
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,918
small towns are battling
for state contracts

7
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:53,721
to build correctional
facilities.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,557
Who'd have thunk it?

9
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,564
Nice, upstanding citizens
begging to have rapists,

10
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:02,034
drug dealers and murderers
right in their own backyard.

11
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:03,365
How is your brother?

12
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,894
The doctor says he's fully
recovered from the overdose.

13
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,931
They're going to keep him in the
hospital overnight for observation,

14
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,499
but Cyril's
going to be fine.

15
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:12,375
Praise the lord.

16
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:15,937
Hey, O'Reily,

17
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:18,246
sorry to hear
about your girlfriend.

18
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:21,413
Who's his girlfriend,
Adebisi?

19
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:24,686
Dr. Nathan.
Yeah, she took a leave of absence.

20
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,921
Apparently, she almost choked to death
when Ryan here came in her mouth.

21
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,361
Fuck you!

22
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,261
- Bring it on!
- Fuck you!

23
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:45,267
What the fuck are you cuffing me for?
l didn't start shit!

24
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,836
Shut your fucking face,
O'Reily!

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,007
Eat me,
you goddamned clit!

26
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,883
l'll take this one.

27
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,680
Fuck you!

28
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:04,225
- Are you crazy?
- God damn it! Fuck!

29
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,532
Just stay down.
Stay the fuck down!

30
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,233
Blow me.

31
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,180
- Again?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,321
Oh, fuck!

33
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:40,830
Rabbi.

34
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:45,167
So, feeling better?

35
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,969
A dead man needs
to cover all his options.

36
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:49,839
You sure you're
a dead man?

37
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,741
Mr. Querns,

38
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:55,612
sometime after you send me
back to Em City,

39
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,140
a day, a week maybe,

40
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:01,585
O'Reily will have
found a way to kill me.

41
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,852
l like you, Stanislofsky.

42
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,189
l don't know why,
but l do.

43
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,627
l can let you stay up here
for a few more days.

44
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,064
What good is going
to come of that?

45
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,263
- Death is inevitable.
- Not necessarily.

46
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:20,865
l plan to have a little talk
with your old pal Ryan O'Reily.

47
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,585
You know...

48
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:35,747
l'm trying to eliminate
violence from Em City.

49
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,689
And doing an amazing job, sir.

50
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,749
Cut the crap!

51
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:42,489
When Stanislofsky returns,
if anything happens to him--

52
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,121
l mean, anything--

53
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46,724
he cuts himself shaving,
l'm holding you responsible.

54
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,961
Hoyt's got the hots
for Stanislofsky, not me.

55
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,266
l don't care.
You're responsible.

56
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,795
- Understand?
- Uh-huh.

57
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
lf Nikolai gets hurt
when he gets back to Em City,

58
00:04:56,443 --> 00:05:00,004
- my ass is grass.
- Right. Now get lost.

59
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,856
- Claire? Baby?
- Yeah? Yeah?

60
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,654
- How much do you love me?
- Oh, plenty.

61
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:16,161
Yeah? Enough to do
anything l ask?

62
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:19,324
- Yeah.
- Thattagirl. Come on.

63
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,240
Cyril! Hey!

64
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,178
How you doing, huh?

65
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,045
You okay?
You feeling better?

66
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:38,016
- Yes.
- Good.

67
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,279
- O'Reily?
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,913
That certain someone
you asked me to inquire about?

69
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:45,254
- Yeah.
- He's coming back to Em City tomorrow.

70
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,816
Stay right there.

71
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,192
Shit.

72
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,254
Ready for this?
He asked Querns for a favor.

73
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:53,458
- What?
- He wants to take a bath.

74
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,130
- There's no bathtubs in Oz.
- Hospital therapy room.

75
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,696
That's perfect.

76
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,605
You know
what to do, right?

77
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
l'm here to pick up
Stanislofsky.

78
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:18,017
Thanks.

79
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,730
You almost done?

80
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:29,792
Five minutes, please.
l'm enjoying myself.

81
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:34,034
l'll bet l can help you enjoy
yourself even more.

82
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,602
Ah, that's good.

83
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,346
How's that?

84
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,255
lt was never like this
in gulag.

85
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:58,625
You men are alike.
So quick, so easily satisfied.

86
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,657
Most of you don't know dick
about making a woman happy.

87
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,130
- Ryan O'Reily does.
- Oh, really?

88
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,867
Here's a small token
of his affection.

89
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:13,636
What is this?

90
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,307
A rubber ducky.

91
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,748
Rubber ducky?

92
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,164
Call the medic.
l think the russian guy is dead.

93
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:46,776
Hey, Mr. Querns,
l heard about Stanislofsky.

94
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:50,214
That's weird. Guy dies before
he gets back to Em City.

95
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,415
Yeah.

96
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,662
Picasso, bend over.

97
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:18,667
Hey, Miles,
special delivery.

98
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,009
Paints, thank fucking Christ.
l'm almost out.

99
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,481
- lt's coming along real nice.
- Nice?

100
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,507
This is a masterpiece
of 21st century art.

101
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,952
This wall should be
in The Louvre.

102
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,792
Hey, Schillinger, next time
try handing them to me.

103
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,991
- Fuck you.
- Lunch.

104
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:41,091
- Hey, what you got, Leroy?
- Chicken nuggets.

105
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,568
Again? Don't you niggers know how
to shake 'n bake anything else?

106
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:46,572
Yo, we've got state dietary
guidelines to follow, dog.

107
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,070
Careful.
You spilled my nuggets.

108
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,047
Fuck you.

109
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,819
- Time to go, Deyell.
- Go?

110
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,383
- Where's he going?
- Meeting with his lawyer.

111
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:11,725
You still trying to appeal
your death sentence, black boy?

112
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,061
Fuck you, bitch!

113
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,964
Man, they ain't
never gonna let you off.

114
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,969
No one's asking
your opinion, asshole.

115
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,471
Yeah, Miles,
give your mouth a rest. Okay?

116
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,515
Judge Fee has denied
our appeal.

117
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,118
Shit. Shit.

118
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,958
Shit, Shit, Shit!

119
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:47,558
- ls there a problem?
- He's fine, officer. We're fine.

120
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:53,805
So what's next?

121
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,206
We go to the state
supreme court

122
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,608
and appeal the appellate
court's decision.

123
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,875
How long is that
going to take?

124
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,905
Given the court's
current caseload,

125
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,814
- l'd say at least a year.
- A year?

126
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:08,048
Dawn, l can't sit up on death row
another day, much less a fucking year!

127
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,884
l didn't create
the system, Moses,

128
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:11,686
l just wallow in it.

129
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,521
Well, can't you drop
some speed on the process?

130
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,961
l don't even know if they're
going to hear our case.

131
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:20,795
Chief Justice Ginther,
who was appointed by James Devlin,

132
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,825
tends to turn a deaf ear
to anything he considers

133
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,031
''soft on crime.''

134
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:27,937
So what you're saying
is l'm fucked?

135
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:31,205
What l'm saying is
time may be on our side.

136
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,940
Rumor is Ginther's
got prostate cancer.

137
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,508
He dies, retires, a new chief might look
at the death penalty differently.

138
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:42,419
- And meanwhile?
- You're alive for another year.

139
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:45,913
Make the best
of a bad situation.

140
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,392
Hey, Deyell, you know how l'm
always calling you ''black boy''?

141
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:54,264
Well, while you were downstairs
with your legal beagle,

142
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,858
l thought, Shit,

143
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,666
there's a whole bunch
of other names l can use.

144
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,400
Nigger, of course.

145
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,374
Or coon,

146
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,000
jigaboo,

147
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,841
spear chucker, schwatza,

148
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,870
mulonian.

149
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:11,383
But l settled on negro.

150
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,147
Negro!

151
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:18,452
lt's got a kind of simplicity.

152
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,686
Negro is the Spanish word
for blacks. A negro.

153
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,093
Negro.

154
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,359
Negro. Negro!

155
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:28,856
Negro! Negro!

156
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,062
Negro, negro, negro!

157
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,877
ldiot! Move out
of the way. ldiot!

158
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,141
lt goes like this, faster!

159
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,614
See this?
Now move.

160
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,025
Cry-baby.

161
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,934
Prisoner number 96Z858,

162
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,801
Eli Zabitz.

163
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,705
Convicted April 1st, 1996,

164
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,504
aggravated assault.

165
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,011
Sentence: nine years,

166
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:16,038
up for parole in six.

167
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,812
- Zabitz.
- Oh, Keller.

168
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,882
- No, no. Where you going?
- l gotta be somewhere.

169
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,053
No, you got to be
right here with me.

170
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,528
Yeah, yeah, okay.

171
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,554
How are your
daughter's teeth?

172
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,624
Oh, l'm proud to say
every one is now a pearl.

173
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,761
l'm glad.
That makes me happy

174
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:39,533
that you're able to provide
dental care before you die.

175
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,665
Die? l'm not--
Jesus, Keller!

176
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:45,404
Why don't you just sit down
and shut the fuck up?

177
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:49,506
Now, you told Tobias Beecher
that l killed his kid.

178
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:53,781
- Yeah, but Schillinger made me do it.
- Shh, Shh, Shh.

179
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,685
Regardless...

180
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,918
soon you're going
to be joining your ancestors.

181
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,588
lf you're going to do it...

182
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,324
why tell me?

183
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,424
So you can get
your affairs in order...

184
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:10,732
and to watch you sweat.

185
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,733
Are listening to me?

186
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,838
Keller says he's going
to whack me.

187
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,576
Will you get off my back?

188
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,379
You're ruining
my concentration.

189
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,943
Listen, you got to protect me,

190
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,922
because if you don't protect me,
l'm going to the hacks

191
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:34,017
and l'm going to tell them
you paid me to lie to Beecher.

192
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,688
Lower your voice.

193
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:42,630
You see what you made me do?
You're fucking up my game here.

194
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:46,069
Your game, huh?
This is my life we're talking about!

195
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:48,164
Look, l said l'd protect you
from Keller.

196
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:50,334
l'll protect you. Okay?

197
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:53,038
- Okay.
- Now buzz off.

198
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:01,509
Jesus, l thought the jews
were supposed to be tough.

199
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:04,489
That's just the lsraelis.

200
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:07,357
Hmm. Kill him.

201
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,292
l'm going to take
that shot again.

202
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:19,065
Hello, Eli.

203
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:23,533
You know, this room
really isn't that safe.

204
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,271
l got stabbed here
once myself.

205
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,404
Fuck, Keller, no!

206
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,039
Oh, thank god.

207
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,880
Get him.

208
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,918
- Schillinger wants you dead.
- What? Fuck!

209
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:41,120
- Robson, this is my kill.
- Take a fucking walk, Keller.

210
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,458
Please!
Please don't kill me!

211
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:44,986
Please!

212
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,689
Fuck!

213
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,241
- Later.
- Later.

214
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,591
- He dead?
- Heart attack.

215
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,325
Jesus.

216
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,300
l told him you got to watch
that red meat.

217
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,822
Beecher!

218
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,901
l'll see you.

219
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,018
You know, you used to be
addicted to alcohol,

220
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,321
then heroin.

221
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,021
But this obsession,

222
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,394
that's the worst

223
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,661
and the most dangerous.

224
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,833
Toby,

225
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,272
l'm talking to you.

226
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,776
Oh, l like it
when you're rough.

227
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:44,146
You're a slut, Beecher.
You'll sleep with anyone.

228
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,083
So?

229
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:48,916
How does that sex make you feel?
You feel better about yourself?

230
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,389
No, worse.

231
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,119
Then why do it?

232
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,754
Because at least
l'm feeling something.

233
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,128
l prefer to be happy,

234
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:02,100
but self-hate
will do in a pinch.

235
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,864
Don't hate yourself.

236
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,168
Why not?

237
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,105
My son is dead
'cause of me.

238
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,477
My daughter's a mess
'cause of me.

239
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,950
And Keller--

240
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:20,383
Keller doesn't love me.

241
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,714
But l tried
this new detergent.

242
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,023
lt really seems
to get the whites clean.

243
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,674
Hello, Chris.
l'm here about Beecher.

244
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,373
l get a half-hour in the gym.
You're eating into my time.

245
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:50,974
Will you just hear me out?
Please?

246
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,583
The man is dying inside.

247
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,747
Well, that's not on me.

248
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,657
l'm not blaming you. l'm asking you
for your help to turn him around.

249
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:03,958
The two of you
had a relationship.

250
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:06,624
You had an intimate
relationship.

251
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:09,099
Oh, come on, Father,

252
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,296
you can say it.

253
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,134
We fucked each other
up the ass,

254
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,867
- in the mouth.
- No, no. Not the fucking,

255
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,239
The love.
The two of you loved each other.

256
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,244
l know that is all over now.
But still,

257
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,746
if you had any real
feelings for him,

258
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,648
l can't believe that you would sit
by and watch what's happening.

259
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,082
He tried to kill me.

260
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,853
You murdered my son!

261
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:30,583
And my relationship
with Beecher--

262
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:34,719
it started in brutality
and that's where it's ended.

263
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,455
Love was the smallest part.

264
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:38,759
l don't really believe
that you believe that.

265
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,191
You don't?

266
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,005
Where do you live, Father?

267
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,836
Where do you live?

268
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:50,535
ln a rectory
at St. Margaret's.

269
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,476
A rectory. Only men
live there, right?

270
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,479
Yeah.

271
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,879
You share common experiences,
a common belief.

272
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:01,580
You accept each other's
eccentricities, flaws.

273
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,918
Some flaws are unacceptable,
like, say,

274
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,254
one priest wants
to fuck another.

275
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:09,318
- Oh, Keller...
- You said, hear me out.

276
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,158
l mean,

277
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,097
l'm just asking
for the same courtesy.

278
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:16,465
Okay.

279
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,902
Unless, of course,
l'm hitting too close to home.

280
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:23,236
- You never have, have you?
- What?

281
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,540
- Fucked a fellow priest.
- No.

282
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,547
- Ever wanted to?
- No.

283
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,710
Oh, come on.
You share a bathroom together.

284
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,879
You walk in and some seminarian's tight,
little ass is hanging out.

285
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:37,650
Keller, l see
what you're up to.

286
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,124
You want me to do
the honorable thing,

287
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,093
the selfless thing.

288
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,458
Say, l'll help Beecher out.

289
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,521
Hey, Mukada,

290
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,293
we're in Oz.

291
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,462
And like l said,
other rules apply.

292
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,061
Now according to the code
we got here,

293
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:55,164
l'm not expected
to save Beecher.

294
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:58,404
l mean, fuck, l'd be breaking
that code if l did.

295
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:02,847
lt only takes one man
to change the way things are.

296
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,645
Yeah?

297
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:07,545
Well, l'm not that man.

298
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,290
Seven out of 10 inmates
are from cities,

299
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,193
but 90°/% of the prisons
themselves

300
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,993
are in rural areas.

301
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:23,399
You know, farmland,
hillsides, forests.

302
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,495
Now you'd think such
bucolic surroundings

303
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,531
would have a calming effect
on those inside.

304
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,736
But no,

305
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,540
out in the wild,

306
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:36,946
things only get wilder.

307
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:46,216
Tobias, we have bad news.

308
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,055
Bad news?
Gee, that's a change.

309
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:50,559
Hank Schillinger got off

310
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,530
on the murdering
and the kidnapping charges.

311
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,590
What?

312
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,966
- You mean he's free?
- Yes.

313
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:59,937
Evidently, when the arrest
was made,

314
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:02,236
the police didn't do something
they were supposed to do

315
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,469
and the judge
just let Hank go free.

316
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,104
- On a technicality?
- Yeah.

317
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:10,405
What happens next?

318
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:12,508
Nothing.
There's nothing that can be done.

319
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,781
Okay.

320
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:19,046
Tobias, aren't you going to stay
and talk about this?

321
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,753
lf there's nothing
to be done,

322
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,694
what is there
to talk about?

323
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,094
Your anger.

324
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,394
Sister, you do not want
to see my anger.

325
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,458
My anger is massive,
all-encompassing.

326
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,298
l'm not afraid.

327
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,402
Fine.

328
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,745
Where the fuck have you been
during all this shit?

329
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:41,939
- Tobias.
- What?

330
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,279
Let him talk.

331
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:47,308
l thought you actually cared,
but only if it doesn't get in the way

332
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:50,015
of your own fucking bullshit.

333
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:52,455
You are nothing
but a selfish cunt.

334
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,692
Now can l go?

335
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,324
Yes, but think
about something.

336
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,359
There's only one person who
really matters in all of this

337
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,836
and it's your daughter Holly.

338
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:10,205
Holly needs your strength!
She needs her father!

339
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:17,211
What is your name?

340
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,146
Hank.

341
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,120
Yo, Dad.

342
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:26,181
Yo?
What kind of talk is that?

343
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,921
l was shittin'
in my pants.

344
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,861
l thought the feds
had me by the balls.

345
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,386
They can't touch you, son.

346
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,998
Do you have
any more cash?

347
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,594
l was thinking
of going to Miami.

348
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,264
Leaving town?

349
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,500
For awhile.

350
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,066
l was hoping we'd get
to spend some time together.

351
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,010
Well, yeah.

352
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:50,447
When l come back we'll do
the father-son thing.

353
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,949
So what do you say?

354
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,645
Can you give me
some more money?

355
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:56,120
Sure, anything you need.

356
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,020
Cool. Cool.

357
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,460
l've arranged with the warden
for you to have regular visits

358
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:03,927
with your daughter.

359
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,055
We spoke to your parents,
and they've agreed

360
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,033
to bring Holly here
three times a week--

361
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,935
twice after school
and Saturdays.

362
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,165
You and she
need the time together.

363
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,935
You need time to heal.

364
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:21,379
Mail.

365
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,176
Stop them!

366
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:32,618
l'm going to kill you,
motherfucker!

367
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,888
Well, l guess you heard
the good news about Hank.

368
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:38,090
Cocksucker!
You fucking cocksucker!

369
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,257
- Take him to Em City!
- You wait!

370
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,359
You fucking wait!

371
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,198
Wowee.

372
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,469
Got quite a temper,
hasn't he?

373
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:02,486
What do you want?

374
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,546
l'd like to have a chat
with Mr. Pancamo.

375
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,615
A chat?

376
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,649
Let me see if he's in
a chatting mood.

377
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,426
Nice shirt.

378
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,166
You can go in.

379
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,006
Mr. Pancamo,
thank you for seeing me.

380
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:27,443
l have to admit
l'm intrigued.

381
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,107
You and me ain't
exactly paisans.

382
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:33,915
l need you
to arrange something.

383
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:36,420
- Drugs?
- No.

384
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:38,753
Two of my children
were kidnapped.

385
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,055
My son Gary was killed.

386
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:42,924
Yeah, l heard.

387
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,451
Schillinger's son Hank did it,

388
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,726
but the bastard got off
on a legal technicality.

389
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:47,993
That sucks.

390
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:50,467
He's out free

391
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,902
and my son lies
rotting in the ground.

392
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,240
l want Hank Schillinger dead.

393
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,369
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

394
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,210
Are you asking me
to set up the hit?

395
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,375
Yes.

396
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:09,410
Well, how do l know this isn't
some kind of sting operation?

397
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:13,254
You working with the hacks
to fuck me over?

398
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,055
The only proof
l have is this.

399
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,653
While you're taking care
of Hank,

400
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:20,256
l'm going to kill his father.

401
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:30,037
Okay.
You got a deal.

402
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:32,737
A thousand for me,
a thousand for the job.

403
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,939
- Cash.
- Okay.

404
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:52,988
Hey.

405
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:57,762
You gonna see
your daughter?

406
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,327
Yup.

407
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,202
The first time
since the kidnapping.

408
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,006
That'll be good for her
and for you.

409
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:12,715
Listen, l saw you
talking with Pancamo.

410
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:16,084
- You saw me with Pancamo?
- Yeah.

411
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:19,215
lt doesn't take a rose cutter
to figure out what's in play.

412
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,593
You're gonna have Hank
Schillinger killed aren't you?

413
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,168
What's the matter,
aren't you going to deny it?

414
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:39,643
You know, you killed Andrew,
Schillinger's son.

415
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:43,205
He killed Gary, your son.
Now you want to kill Hank?

416
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:45,808
Beecher, when is all this
madness going to end?

417
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:49,417
After l kill Schillinger.

418
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,979
And then you're going
to end up on death row.

419
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,288
And what good are you going
to be to your daughter then?

420
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,055
What good am l to her now?

421
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,571
Holly?

422
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:21,350
Oh, baby.
How are you doing?

423
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:25,683
lt's so good to see you.

424
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,490
My beautiful girl.

425
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,292
l love my daughter.

426
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,818
- l know you do.
- l only want the best for her.

427
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:06,023
Of course.

428
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:14,297
She shouldn't have to carry
the weight of my mistakes.

429
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:29,278
- Excuse me, Mr. Pancamo.
- Hey, Beecher.

430
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:30,845
Thanks for
the prompt payment.

431
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,982
l wish others lived
by your example.

432
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:36,119
Look, l have thought it over
and l've changed my mind.

433
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,686
l want to call off the hit
on Hank Schillinger.

434
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,858
That's fine,

435
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,164
except for one little thing.

436
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:46,067
You're too late.

437
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:47,662
He's dead?

438
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,606
Bullet right through
the brain.

439
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,199
Oh, shit.

440
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:52,471
But don't worry.

441
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,240
They're never going
to find the body,

442
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,543
never in a million years.

443
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,846
Hank Schillinger
has simply disappeared.

444
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:11,892
Time to go home, Rebadow.

445
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:23,097
Since l took over this unit,
violence has decreased by 92°/%.

446
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:25,006
92°/%!

447
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:28,501
That statistic would be higher
but for you, Rebadow,

448
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:31,380
trying to shank Busmalis
in the middle of the night.

449
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,974
l'm very sorry, sir.

450
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,145
And l assure you nothing
like that will happen again.

451
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:36,779
Good.
Because if it does,

452
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:38,551
l'm sending you to Gen Pop,

453
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,650
where they'll eat your ass
for lunch.

454
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,183
Take off.

455
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,802
- You feel better now?
- Hey, killer.

456
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,641
- Hey, killer.
- Dog in the house.

457
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:05,716
You talk to God lately?

458
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,411
Watch out
for Busmalis.

459
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,479
lf you come at me,
l'm ready to go down fighting.

460
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:16,221
No, no, no.
l apologize, Agamemnon.

461
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:19,389
l don't know what
came over me.

462
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:21,831
lt was like l was

463
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,267
possessed or something.

464
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,862
l ask for your forgiveness.

465
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,463
Well...

466
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,109
Please!

467
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,411
Stop!

468
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:47,653
Just stop!
Stop talking!

469
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,991
Please!

470
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,640
Mr. Querns, sir, did the doctors figure
out what's wrong with Rebadow?

471
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,041
Brain tumor.

472
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:07,874
Oh, my god.

473
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:10,814
They're shipping him off to Dennsley
Memorial for emergency surgery.

474
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,874
Before he goes,
may l see him?

475
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,681
No.

476
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,820
He wanted me to shake
his hand.

477
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,518
l didn't shake his hand.
Please, can l see him?

478
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,151
No.

479
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,558
We're here to pick up
Robert Rebadow.

480
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,360
Over there.

481
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:38,739
Hey, stop that.

482
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:42,079
Leave me alone.

483
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,081
- Leave me alone!
- Relax, pop.

484
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,447
l want somebody l know
to go with me.

485
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,975
On three.
One, two, three.

486
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,284
l don't know you.

487
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:53,223
Dr. Nathan.

488
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,123
Dr. Nathan!

489
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:59,263
Busmalis!
Busmalis!

490
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:01,663
Mama.

491
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,930
Mama!

492
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:05,436
Mama!!

493
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:45,076
The census bureau
counts prisoners

494
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,704
just like they count
everybody else.

495
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:50,806
But the census bureau considers
prisoners as residents

496
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:52,783
of the township
where the prison is located,

497
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:55,479
not where they lived before
they got convicted.

498
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,455
''So what?'' you say.

499
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,186
The state uses these numbers
to determine where financial aid

500
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:03,091
like poverty funds are spent.

501
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:07,224
Some rinky-dink town upstate
gets a big, fat check,

502
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,529
while the inner city
where the money would keep

503
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,125
people from committing crimes

504
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:13,569
gets zippity-doo-dah.

505
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,903
The census,

506
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,601
is senseless.

507
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:24,311
You all wanted to see me?

508
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:26,817
Yeah, Adebisi's got
a bug up his ass

509
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:28,978
- about your friend Mobay.
- l don't like him.

510
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,488
Mobay's filled his quota.
He brought us five new customers.

511
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:34,151
- Leave him the fuck alone.
- Which customers?

512
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:37,218
Look, Tidd and Browne, they gave us
the name of their new babies.

513
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,730
Mobay only knows
them by face.

514
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:41,789
You actually seen him sell
tits to anybody?

515
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,664
No, no.

516
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,727
We got the cash.
Who cares?

517
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,397
He could be undercover.

518
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,407
With the amount of shit
he shoves up his nose,

519
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,534
no fucking chance.

520
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:54,170
Look, next time he sells,

521
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:55,975
l want you by his side.

522
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:57,606
By his side!

523
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,617
All right.
Yeah.

524
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,914
This hands sucks, man.

525
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:07,348
They insist on watching me sell
the drugs to somebody.

526
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:09,724
Only l can't legally do that.
So either way, l'm fucked.

527
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:11,558
Unless...

528
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,530
call your lieutenant.

529
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:16,193
Have him bring in another
undercover detective.

530
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:17,861
You sell the drugs
to another cop,

531
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,563
nobody gets hurt.

532
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:21,936
Warden, that's genius.

533
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:25,636
lf l'm such a genius how come
l can't pick out a poster?

534
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:27,440
l mean, none of them
look like me.

535
00:34:57,776 --> 00:35:00,244
See, l told you
Mobay's okay.

536
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,884
Bruno Goergen fell down
an elevator shaft.

537
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,014
Yeah, freak accident.

538
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:13,785
No, he was pushed.

539
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,520
Wait, Mobay.
Please, man.

540
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:20,862
Really?

541
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:24,460
l'm here to find out
who murdered him.

542
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:27,903
- Any suggestions?
- Nope.

543
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,366
You never saw Goergen have any
confrontations with anybody?

544
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,900
No.

545
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:36,812
And you never had any
confrontations with him yourself?

546
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:38,338
No.

547
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:43,180
Now you see,
that's not what l heard.

548
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:46,657
Look, lady,
you can keep excavating,

549
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,852
but there are no secrets
buried in my brain.

550
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,766
l'll be back.

551
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,703
- Anything?
- This one knows something.

552
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,738
l'm gonna let him sit there
alone for awhile,

553
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:13,444
see what percolates.

554
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,868
Where you been?

555
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:38,239
With a homicide detective

556
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,868
avoiding her questions.

557
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,812
Relax.
She don't know nothing.

558
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,543
You ain't got no guilt
about what you did, do you?

559
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,414
Guilt?

560
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:49,818
We are both of us,
the same, Mobay.

561
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,118
Cop killers.

562
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:54,181
Except every single day,

563
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,125
l wish l could take back
what l'd done.

564
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,424
Goergen was a monster.

565
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:01,660
Yeah, it takes a monster
to kill a monster, right?

566
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:04,190
l guess so.

567
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,447
Peace, black man.

568
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:22,316
You wishing me peace?

569
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:27,691
- Move out of my way.
- You ain't going nowhere.

570
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:33,725
l see you went to Adebisi,
asked him to grease me.

571
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,392
ls that any way
for a brother

572
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:37,799
to act towards
another brother?

573
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,530
Move.

574
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:41,562
l could kill you right now.

575
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:44,632
But you won't 'cause Adebisi
promised Querns

576
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,144
no violence in Em City.

577
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:50,579
- Move.
- Okay, Arif.

578
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,845
But watch where you walking.

579
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:55,148
You wouldn't want
to get hit from something

580
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,586
falling down from the sky now,
would you?

581
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,767
All right, everybody.

582
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,826
Let's go!

583
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,181
Do you need something?

584
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:26,240
Yes.

585
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:35,091
lmam,

586
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:37,060
l have committed
a great sin.

587
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,620
l am no longer the lmam.

588
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:40,722
l have failed,

589
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:45,668
l have disgraced myself
and our faith.

590
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:48,069
And because of my blindness,

591
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:51,974
we are all in danger.

592
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,837
l know.

593
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,610
Lead us, Kareem.

594
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:04,179
No.

595
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:07,555
Stop hiding
from who you are.

596
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:10,186
Stop hiding from who God
wants you to be.

597
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:12,492
ln the name of Allah,
l ask you.

598
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,395
Lead us.

599
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:25,672
- Oh, Miss Sally.
- Miss Sally, l love you.

600
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:28,612
Attention!

601
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:31,638
The following prisoners are
being transferred to Unit B:

602
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,778
94D696, Downing;

603
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,017
98M922, Masters;

604
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:42,356
96Z506, Zonioni.

605
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:45,055
Get your stuff,
follow Officer Howell out.

606
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,757
Let's go, ladies!

607
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:55,029
More white guys
leaving Em City?

608
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:59,168
They're white,
but they ain't guys.

609
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,805
Still, it's looking
pretty dark around here.

610
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,183
True.

611
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:42,143
Prisoner number 00B563,

612
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:43,847
Raymond Browne,

613
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:45,856
aka, ''Mondo'' Browne,

614
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,791
convicted April 10th, 2000,

615
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:50,225

616
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,354
Sentence: 27 years,

617
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:55,627
up for parole in 11.

618
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,930
- Fuck you, man.
- Fuck you, nigger.

619
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:06,569
What the fuck
do you want to do?

620
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:09,603
- l'm a patient man, l'll wait.
- Take Zanghi to the hole.

621
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,945
What do you mean? He didn't do a fucking
thing. You know it!

622
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:13,712
l heard him say nigger.
He provoked Browne.

623
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,719
- That's bullshit!
- Back away, Pancamo.

624
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,414
Fuck all you guys.

625
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,132
All right, break this up!
Break it up!

626
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:32,693
Browne, get out of here!
Come on, break it up.

627
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,914
Yeah!

628
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:51,278
Do it, baby.
Slowly, slowly.

629
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,788
Kiss my foot.
Kiss it.

630
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:25,949
Hello, boys.

631
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,220
- We gotta talk.
- So talk.

632
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,624
What the fuck
are you doing?

633
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,854
We're your partners.

634
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:32,988
You think you're
going to fuck us over

635
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,622
and we're just going
to take it up the ass?

636
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,160
Morales, nobody
wants your ass.

637
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:40,670
Johnson hits me
with his fuckin' stick,

638
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:41,933
throws Zanghi in the hole.

639
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,305
That ain't the fucking deal,
Adebisi.

640
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:48,779
Besides it's been 10 days since
we've seen any green.

641
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,940
You pocketing the profits?

642
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:54,440
No, there's plenty of profits.

643
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,953
But there's been a change
in the organization.

644
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:58,319
How so?

645
00:42:58,356 --> 00:43:02,850
Well, you know,
we three were partners

646
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,589
and now we're not.

647
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:07,097
- What?
- l don't need you boys anymore.

648
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,097
You looking
to start a war?

649
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:15,605
Now if there was a war,

650
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,665
you'd lose.

651
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,435
Look around.

652
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:23,504
See all these faces?

653
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,749
They match mine.

654
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:33,183
No, boys,
there won't be any war.

655
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,816
And why the fuck not?

656
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,657
Because you
and your pal

657
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:40,425
are about to take
a little holiday over to Unit B.

658
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:42,227
What?
When?

659
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,757
Oh, look.

660
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:47,293
l would say now.

661
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:51,065
Come on.

662
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,335
Hey, l'm going to miss you.

663
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:00,407
Say hi to Schillinger
for me, huh?

664
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,393
As you can see, we have some
more prisoner transfers

665
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:19,870
including trustees
Pancamo and Morales.

666
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:23,840
So l'm naming Supreme Allah

667
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:28,402
and Poet to replace them
as trustees.

668
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,766
Said...

669
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,564
l told you.

670
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:54,468
l told you to join me.

671
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:58,201
But you never listen.
You never listen.

672
00:44:58,242 --> 00:44:59,641
You know what?

673
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,975
That is what is going
to kill you in the end.

674
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:04,846
And what's going
to kill you, Adebisi,

675
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,941
AlDS or an O.D.?

676
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:09,248
Don't worry about me.

677
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:11,049
l don't.

678
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,022
l worry about
the people around you

679
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:15,719
breathing the air
you poison.

680
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,794
Look, l've created a utopia.

681
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,764
Your Shangri-la Sama.

682
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,562
This is not Sama.

683
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:26,365
This is an inferno.

684
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:29,669
We have all the control
and all the power,

685
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:30,799
finally.

686
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,809
A bad system
run by blacks

687
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:35,539
is the same as bad
system run by whites.

688
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,379
Bad? We have everything
we want.

689
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:41,681
We have everything
in our grasp.

690
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,587
You think you've recreated
the world, don't you?

691
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:48,990
Simon,

692
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:51,290
lt's just an illusion.

693
00:45:51,328 --> 00:45:55,264
Real power can only
come from the grace of God

694
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:57,961
The Almighty.

695
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,492
lf l wanted to,

696
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:03,268
l could crush you
like a cockroach.

697
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:05,935
Yes, but you won't

698
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,944
because l am the only one

699
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:10,913
who speaks the truth
to you.

700
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:16,445
Your truth, not mine.

701
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:37,400
Adebisi's turned Em City into
a fucking Zulu nation.

702
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:40,069
What the fuck are we
supposed to do?

703
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,705
Create our own country.

704
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:52,321
McManus, we got to talk.

705
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:54,347
Make an appointment
with my secretary.

706
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:55,983
This is serious.

707
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah, l can tell.

708
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,430
You got that Schillinger
scowl going.

709
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:03,194
Your precious little dream,

710
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:05,429
your Emerald City,
is now a ghetto.

711
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:06,868
You been there lately?

712
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:08,462
Crap all over the floors,

713
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:10,440
drugs everywhere,

714
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,772
the lack of primary colors.

715
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:14,903
Well, that unit is no longer
my responsibility.

716
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:17,573
Hey, l got no problem
with that.

717
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:19,708
What we don't want
is that new attitude over there

718
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,048
to come wafting this way.

719
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:24,247
They hear about
what's going on,

720
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:26,415
empowerment,

721
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,288
they're going to want
the same thing here.

722
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:31,761
And you're suggesting what,

723
00:47:31,795 --> 00:47:34,093
that we make Unit B
all white?

724
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:35,530
Yes.

725
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:37,295
Get the fuck away
from me.

726
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:38,926
Let the niggers
have Em City.

727
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:41,096
Fuck, let them have
the whole goddamn prison,

728
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:42,696
as long as we're safe
over here.

729
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,230
Goodbye, Vern.

730
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:46,971
Don't be a bigger fool
than you've already been.

731
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:48,638
Lockdown!

732
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,671
- Lock the unit down!
- You'll see.

733
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:54,183
You'll wish you listened
to me, McManus.

734
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:55,583
Now!

735
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,221
The new electric perimeter fencing
will go into operation next wednesday.

736
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:07,696
As of then, we'll be able
to eliminate

737
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:10,495
the 24-hour watchtower
surveillance

738
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:12,365
which should save us
countless manhours.

739
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:14,530
Hey, sorry l'm late.

740
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,368
Emerald City
is a shithouse!

741
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:19,137
McManus--

742
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:20,609
There's garbage
all over the place.

743
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:22,771
Oh? And in Unit B
you can eat off the floor.

744
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,178
Enough!

745
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,648
The motherfucker's
jealous of me.

746
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:27,310
- Jealous?
- That's right, jealous.

747
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:29,444
- Martin, please.
- No, he knows it.

748
00:48:29,486 --> 00:48:32,011
Since l took over Em City,
there's been next to no violence.

749
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:33,614
My system works.

750
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:35,682
At what price?

751
00:48:36,694 --> 00:48:38,559
Huh?

752
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:41,824
At what fucking price?

753
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:52,836
McManus?

754
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:59,214
McManus?

755
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,613
For God's sake, McManus,
stop, please.

756
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:19,327
Conditions in Emerald City
are deteriorating rapidly.

757
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:22,669
Something has to be done
to stop Adebisi.

758
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,503
Hey, why are you
coming to me?

759
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:26,099
- Talk to Querns.
- l have.

760
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:28,134
Querns is willing to turn
a blind eye to what

761
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:30,908
Adebisi is doing as long
as order is maintained.

762
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,109
Then talk to Glynn.

763
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,311
l've tried that, too.
He seems indifferent,

764
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:39,516
distracted because of his
election campaign.

765
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:42,286
No.

766
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:44,123
lt's up to you and me.

767
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,186
You and me?

768
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,223
Adebisi needs to be
shut down and fast.

769
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:54,727
lf that means
eliminating Querns,

770
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:55,932
so be it.

771
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:02,135
- You have a plan?
- Yeah...

772
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:05,373
l have a plan.

773
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:30,202
l was wrong, Adebisi.

774
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,708
l see that now.

775
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,642
You truly have transformed
his cell block

776
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:40,650
into a paradise.

777
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,016
A utopia.

778
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,987
l'm going to say it
for everybody to hear.

779
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,723
l want to join you,

780
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,990
and serve you in
whatever way you choose.

781
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:04,806
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

782
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,344
Then swear to me

783
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,348
in the name of Allah.

784
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,650
l do so swear.

785
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:25,323
l've waited for this moment.

786
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:30,793
Now l can raise you
as my equal.

787
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:35,100
Together there's nothing
we can't do.

788
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:38,438
Nothing.

789
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:40,170
Nothing!

790
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,838
Nothing, nothing.

791
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:46,810
Nothing.

792
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,512
Nothing!

793
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:52,522
Nothing. Nothing.

794
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:07,101
Nothing! Nothing!

795
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:19,106
Let me see
your hands up!

796
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:23,751
Adebisi and Said,
hand in hand.

797
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:26,415
lt's the end
of the fucking universe.

798
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,691
Those census numbers
l was talking about,

799
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:37,791
they're also used to determine
election districts.

800
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:41,635
A senator from a white
rural area with a prison

801
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:44,072
can count the inmates
as his constitutes,

802
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:47,508
and therefore, increase
his political influence.

803
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:50,104
Those inmates
who are largely of color

804
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:52,047
aren't allowed to vote.

805
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:54,710
The senator has no allegiance
to them at all.

806
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:58,118
ln fact, he benefits
by voting for laws

807
00:52:58,155 --> 00:53:00,555
to keep them
incarcerated longer.

808
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:02,388
The town benefits

809
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:05,862
by the increased
prison population.

810
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:06,885
Yeah.

811
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,057
Everybody benefits.

812
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:15,132
Somebody must
stop him and soon.

813
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:22,771
Nora?

814
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:24,576
Leo, l'm sorry for
stopping by so suddenly.

815
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,641
l know you're busy running
things and the campaign and all,

816
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:30,380
- but l didn't know who else to call.
- Well, what's the matter?

817
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,183
lt's Clayton.

818
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:35,282
Sweet Jesus, l don't know
my own son anymore.

819
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,555
l mean, with him giving
the inmate the gun

820
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:39,653
and then the African dress
and now...

821
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:41,561
What?

822
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,864
l found this in his room.

823
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,766
lt's like he's collected all
of his anger toward the world

824
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:53,241
and is pointing it toward
the Governor.

825
00:53:53,277 --> 00:53:54,801
Where's Clayton now?

826
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:56,813
l don't know.
He hasn't been home in days.

827
00:53:56,847 --> 00:54:00,476
Well, when he comes back,
you call me. Okay?

828
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:03,953
ln the meantime,
try not to worry. All right?

829
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,650
With these new
stab-proof vests,

830
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:13,185
the correctional officers
here and across the state

831
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,357
will have the very best
protection.

832
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:19,233
Their safety
is paramount to me.

833
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:21,396
These are the men and women

834
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:24,373
who keep the forces
of darkness at bay.

835
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:28,034
There are those who
say no more prisons;

836
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:31,639
Well, l say
no more crime.

837
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:33,980
Fuck you!

838
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:53,760
Somebody get a doctor,
get a medic in here.

839
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:01,675
The governor's been shot!
Get some help!

840
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:05,913
Get a doctor!
