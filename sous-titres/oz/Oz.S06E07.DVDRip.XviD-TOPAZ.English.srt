1
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:45,303
Junk is the stuff that
was once valuable to us,

2
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,238
but that we now
have no use for.

3
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,037
Some junk is put away in storage
in the hopes of possible reuse.

4
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,941
Some junk
is discarded.

5
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,947
Either way, it's never really gone.
It's only out of sight.

6
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,473
Junk is still
and always somewhere.

7
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,048
Hill's book, man,
he writes good.

8
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,186
Make me
a little jealous.

9
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,960
- You got any tits?
- Nah, I'm all out.

10
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,092
Man, I ain't had
a taste in so long,

11
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,433
I feel like
I'm in rehab.

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,200
Yeah, we ain't
got no income.

13
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,141
The bookbinding
business went bust.

14
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,144
The wops block us
from slinging.

15
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,477
- Something will come along.
- You sure?

16
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,416
I'm like old
Billy Clinton, yo.

17
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,544
I live in a town
called Hope.

18
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,319
Prisoner #03B563:

19
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,093
Stanley Bukowski;

20
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,776
convicted January 16,
2003;

21
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,983
possession and distribution
of illegal substances;

22
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,518
sentence: 15 years;
up for parole in 7.

23
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,935
Hey, new guy.
Got any tits?

24
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,635
- No man, I ain't into the hard stuff.
- You got any weed?

25
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,406
There ain't nearly
enough weed for the need

26
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,003
in this
fucking place.

27
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,949
But I got
a shipment coming in.

28
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,509
Better watch
where you toke, cuz.

29
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,384
No no,
no puffing involved.

30
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,049
Only eating.

31
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,059
I got a shitload
of very green,

32
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,496
very kind pot brownies
heading this way.

33
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,295
Thinking of starting
a little industry,

34
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,767
if you get my drift.

35
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,602
Huh, well you see, Bukowski,
what you need is partners,

36
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,166
or else certain people
will find out

37
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,143
that you're stepping
on their turf.

38
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,578
We can make
the trouble stay away.

39
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,845
This is bullshit.
He won't get them through inspection.

40
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,874
He don't even know
the right hacks.

41
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,910
Yeah, I got that
all figured out, all right?

42
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,754
The pot
is totally i-o-nized,

43
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,160
so it don't reek at all.
Not even to the mutt's nose.

44
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,131
The rest of the recipe
I'm guarding like the Coke formula.

45
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,999
Suffice to say, the body buzz,
oh, is kick ass.

46
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,732
You know what?
Double fudge, too,

47
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,605
with extra thick icing
for effect.

48
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,509
Stanley,
you a genius.

49
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,136
- What's up?
- I like that.

50
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,670
Come on, man.

51
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,683
Mail call!

52
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,418
- That's all?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,520
Bukowski, you got
a box of brownies.

54
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,111
Here you go, cuz.

55
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,887
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,899
Welcome back
to "Sallycize."

57
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,167
We're gonna play some volleyball
today, so get your balls out

58
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,697
and make sure
they're firm and round,

59
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,937
'cause we're gonna
bounce them high.

60
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,502
And side and up.
That's right.

61
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,812
Keep your wrists
stiff and stiff...

62
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,545
This is the best
"Miss Sally" ever.

63
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,453
And stiff, jump, and stiff, jump.
Good, everybody.

64
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,482
Jump. Work your arms,
stiff, stiff and hard.

65
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,086
Yeah, hard,
pump it up!

66
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,305
Ganja brownies.
Why didn't we think of that?

67
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,606
That punk is gonna
suck off our profits.

68
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,703
He could hurt us,
that's for sure.

69
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,908
That bastard
needs a funeral.

70
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,076
Pena di morte.

71
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,521
There's definitely
butter in there.

72
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,152
Of course there's butter,
Kenaniah, it's a brownie.

73
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,561
What we're trying
to do is figure out

74
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,862
Bukowski's secret ingredient.

75
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,867
Man, we can guess
till we green.

76
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:51,138
The only answer is get the recipe
from Bukowski himself.

77
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:55,045
Yeah, yeah, then we can
unload his white ass.

78
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,418
Look, you fucks better leave me alone
or my home boys are gonna...

79
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,622
- What, they're gonna come after us?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,392
Call them,
go ahead.

81
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,966
Oh, I feel
like Custer.

82
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,199
Come on, Custer,
let's take a walk.

83
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,050
- He's dead?
- I hear his face melted.

84
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,750
There goes our
latest enterprise.

85
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,624
What you mean? We got Bukowski
to spill the secret recipe, right?

86
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,562
Nah, I called in the specifics
to my Cousin Malcolm,

87
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,861
told him to mix up a batch.

88
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,026
- He said the stuff is shit.
- Wait wait wait wait.

89
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,332
- Bukowski lied to us?
- Uh-huh.

90
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,600
Fuck, man, you can't
trust anybody these days.

91
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,436
Man, I say it's
the wops fault.

92
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,103
Let's just go bust
some heads, man.

93
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,580
Wait. Yo, I got a plan,
and it all starts with Burr.

94
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,316
Hey, Burr.

95
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,149
Yo, Burr,
we want back in.

96
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,252
Whatever you want,
telemarketing, whichever.

97
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,765
For starters,
say that again.

98
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,827
This time,
on your knees.

99
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,203
- You serious?
- Bend them!

100
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,333
Bend 'em, man.

101
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,536
Get down, man.

102
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,509
Yo, we... we...

103
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,072
Shut the fuck up.
I heard you the first time.

104
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,811
Be there
tomorrow morning

105
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,912
ready to work
them phones.

106
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,823
Come on, man,
just come on.

107
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,959
See, Burr, I knew you'd
fill these desks again.

108
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,559
Yeah, well, I finally
convinced my boys

109
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,002
to follow
the straight and narrow.

110
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,101
Okay, we're here.

111
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,075
Now, you gonna tell me
your big plan?

112
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,944
Credit cards.
Every time we take a order,

113
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,914
we steal
the credit card numbers.

114
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,045
My Cousin Malcolm,
he can sell the list for major dough.

115
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,418
Cyber-slinging.

116
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,118
- I love it.
- All right, all right.

117
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,026
10 months ago divers
swimming deep in the Pacific

118
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,690
discovered two pieces
of the P.T. 109.

119
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,666
That's the boat JFK was
commander of in World War II

120
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,794
when it was sunk
by a Japanese destroyer.

121
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,033
In the past they've also found
the Titanic, the Hunley,

122
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,735
and hundreds of thousands
of other ships lost at sea.

123
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,007
Makes you wonder
how much is down there.

124
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,514
How badly have we littered
the ocean floor?

125
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,210
The best part is
sea life adapts.

126
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,118
They take our naval junk
and make it their own,

127
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,145
make it their home.

128
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,826
Rebadow, where's Stella?
I need to talk to her.

129
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,127
Today's the day
of her lumpectomy.

130
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,997
Oh God, yeah,
I forgot.

131
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,832
Stella said she'd have her friend
call as soon as she was out of danger.

132
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,701
I'm sure
she'll be fine.

133
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,536
Yes, hello?

134
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,940
I'd like to send
some flowers.

135
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,976
- Any word from Stella?
- No.

136
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,385
I thought she'd be done
with the surgery by now.

137
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,879
Sometimes hospitals
get backed up.

138
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,985
Hey, bookworm!
Bookworm!

139
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,963
You gonna read
another book, fag?

140
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,798
- Ignore him, Pablo.
- Fuck that.

141
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,301
Get back in the cell!

142
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,860
Time for final count.
Let's go.

143
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,526
I still haven't heard from Stella.
Five more minutes.

144
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,125
It's now or the hole.

145
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,313
Bob, don't be worried.

146
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,373
Stella's indestructible.

147
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,318
No one's indestructible.

148
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,914
Funny, I got all
caught up in thinking

149
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,254
she needed me
to beat the cancer,

150
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,453
but in truth,
she didn't need me.

151
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,622
And that hurts
all the more.

152
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,169
Oh, thank God.

153
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,645
Score is love-love,
everybody.

154
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,910
There's gonna be a lot
of squatting down.

155
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,383
It's gonna be a lot
of quick moves, thrusting...

156
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,010
Oh, good.

157
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,283
Time to exercise
the old fantasy muscle.

158
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,586
Hit those balls,
hit 'em!

159
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,025
They ought to do a Miss Sally marathon
and bring the schoolyard back.

160
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,824
Especially
since Busmalis

161
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,331
didn't learn his lesson
of the day the first time.

162
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,096
Miss Sally says, "Don't try
and marry my slutty secretary."

163
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,728
They're jealous.

164
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,569
The two oldest guys in the joint
are the only true Romeos.

165
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,303
Yo, Busmalis, you really
gonna do it again?

166
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,140
Getting left at
the altar and all?

167
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,043
Even if the wedding
do go through,

168
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,572
he gotta play baby daddy
to a kid ain't even his.

169
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,585
Some might consider that
an act of generosity.

170
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,849
I consider it
an act of insanity.

171
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,790
The brat was conceived on what should
have been your honeymoon.

172
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,487
That's like freakier
than cloning.

173
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,554
Yo, the warden's not even gonna let him
get a kick-off conjugal.

174
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,227
- Marriage ain't marriage without sex.
- That's right.

175
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,997
You gonna step
in here, Bob?

176
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,335
You do have some
serious issues to resolve.

177
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,332
Great.

178
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:02,144
Well, to all you lonely,
horny naysayers

179
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,514
with no one but Rosie Palm
and her five sisters

180
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,382
to love you,
I say this.

181
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,216
Right here, baby.

182
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,746
Right in my
big blue balls,

183
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,352
coming back to life
'cause I'm going to the chapel

184
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,386
and I'm gonna
get married, yeehaw!

185
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,295
Better get
your Viagra ass out.

186
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,093
Stop that.
She'll be here.

187
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,265
She's more than
an hour and a half late.

188
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,037
Do you have any idea
how little time that is

189
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,771
to a man
serving 10 years?

190
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,644
We'll wait
a little bit longer.

191
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,413
Agamemnon, you may want
to consider the possibility that...

192
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,912
Never! She'll be here
in three seconds.

193
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,451
One, two...

194
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,596
Two and a half.

195
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,501
Oh, Aggie,
I'm so sorry!

196
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,304
Please tell me
that you got the message.

197
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,106
- What message?
- I called,

198
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,136
told some guy
who answered the phone

199
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,876
that the sitter was late.
He promised to pass it along.

200
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,350
Promises don't mean
a whole hell of a lot in Oz.

201
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,286
Well mine certainly does.
Marry me!

202
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,290
Hit it, Father!

203
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,396
In 1957, the first satellite
was sent into space.

204
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,867
Since then 4,186 satellites
have followed.

205
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,335
300 of them
are still up there,

206
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,771
defunct, abandoned.
Some the size of Volkswagens.

207
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,298
Occasionally you hear
that one of them

208
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,709
is gonna fall out of the sky,
gonna hit the Earth.

209
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,440
The experts say,
don't worry.

210
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,971
Most likely it'll
crash into the ocean.

211
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,076
Most times they're right,
but, brother,

212
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,711
I don't want
to be standing around

213
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,188
the one time
they're wrong.

214
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,021
I asked to be placed
in Em City for one purpose

215
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,530
and one purpose only,

216
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,329
to find someone
to kill me.

217
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,342
Good morning.

218
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,354
Have you figured out
a way to kill me yet?

219
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,084
No.

220
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,455
Can't fuckin'
concentrate

221
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,086
with you
sweating me 24/7.

222
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,689
Could we at least
discuss a timetable?

223
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,756
Count!

224
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,582
Yo, I need
to see McManus now.

225
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,890
Of all the ridiculous things
that you've said and done,

226
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,863
and there have been plenty,
this is the most ridiculous.

227
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,230
Okay, it's crazy, I know,
but look, it's true.

228
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,428
Idzik wants me
to whack him.

229
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,369
Yeah, right.

230
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,396
You know, this is just your feeble
attempt to cover your tracks.

231
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,239
You've been threatening to kill
that man ever since he got to Oz.

232
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,302
I know I did,
but I don't now, right?

233
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,577
I mean, there's something about the man
begging me to do the deed,

234
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,607
I don't know, makes it so...
makes it so wrong.

235
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,449
Like I said,
ridiculous.

236
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,352
Get the fuck out
of my office.

237
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,880
- McManus...
- Now!

238
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,898
Well?

239
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,613
Look, Idzik,

240
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,413
you gotta look at this thing
from my perspective, okay?

241
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,478
You're asking me
to commit a criminal act,

242
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,686
and yet you refuse
to tell me why.

243
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,957
I killed Kareem Said.

244
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,123
Why isn't that reason
enough for you?

245
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,498
For me, yeah, yeah,
that's... but still,

246
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,594
that don't tell me
why you wanna die.

247
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,430
Okay.

248
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,904
But not here,
follow me.

249
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,321
Light. That's what
this is all about.

250
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,721
That's what makes
everything happen.

251
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,588
Not just
in this room,

252
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:45,495
but everywhere on the planet,
in every corner of the universe,

253
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,365
light generates life.

254
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,631
But that's coming
to an end.

255
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,166
What are you
talking about, how?

256
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,176
When suns
and stars explode

257
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,770
they create new suns,
new stars.

258
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,441
And each time,

259
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,609
these new entities
are smaller,

260
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,812
containing less energy.

261
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:12,722
And so when they too
explode, as they must,

262
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,556
the next stars and suns

263
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,789
are even smaller,

264
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,560
even weaker.

265
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,558
Eventually all the gas,
all the heat,

266
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,333
all the light
will dissipate.

267
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,670
The galaxies will
grow cold and still.

268
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,368
What happens to us then?

269
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,007
Without light
we cease to exist.

270
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,923
We could maybe, um...

271
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,928
build a rocket ship,
right?

272
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,988
Omar, there'd be no energy

273
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,659
to fuel the rocket to space.

274
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,669
Besides, there'd be
nowhere to go.

275
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,864
There's nowhere to hide
from the inevitable.

276
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,897
All life will stop.

277
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,966
Damn.

278
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,070
So don't you see?
Everything that we do,

279
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,377
the plans we make,
the hopes we have,

280
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,645
they're futile.

281
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,482
Being good at a job,
which I was,

282
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,957
building a home, which I did,
raising a family...

283
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,227
which I had,

284
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,092
none of it
means anything.

285
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,620
Because no matter
how we try,

286
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,759
how much we strive
and struggle,

287
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,792
it'll all come
to naught.

288
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,829
Life is a waste of time.

289
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,307
So that's why
I'm counting on you

290
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,310
to kill me.

291
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,675
You will, won't you?

292
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,239
Look look look,
I need some more time.

293
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,410
I need some time
to think, all right?

294
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,579
I'll give you
my answer by noon, okay?

295
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,938
Yo, Reb,

296
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,536
you got any literature
on, um...

297
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,241
the end of the world?

298
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,619
Nebuli, neb... nebuli.

299
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,988
Galaxies and quasars,
it's awesome.

300
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,589
Heat.

301
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,157
Heat and...

302
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,169
gas.

303
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,228
Simple.

304
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,265
It's noon, and you said
you'd have an answer by now.

305
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,573
I do. Come here.
Come here, look.

306
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,739
I been doing a lot
of reading

307
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,714
about doomsday scenarios.

308
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,740
From the apocalypse

309
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,844
to, uh,
the Crunch Theory,

310
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,754
um, black holes,

311
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,088
meteorites bombarding
the Earth.

312
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,321
It's just
like you said.

313
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,264
You know, no matter
what we do, someday,

314
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,133
light, heat

315
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,069
and gas

316
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,201
will be
extinguished forever.

317
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,403
But there's one thing,

318
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,571
one thing you didn't mention.

319
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,808
It won't be a void.

320
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,149
You know, there won't be
just nothingness.

321
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,553
You see, the weakest
force in nature

322
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,490
will become dominant,

323
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,757
and that's
g-r-a-v-i-t-y,

324
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,128
- gravity.
- So?

325
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,601
So? So?

326
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,196
Something will
still exist.

327
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,174
There'll still be
an energy in the universe.

328
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,837
I mean, maybe our physical
bodies won't be here, but...

329
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:58,316
we will still be part
of that new dynamic.

330
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,716
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be better.

331
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,448
I very much
doubt that.

332
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,514
Yeah, but if there's just even just
the slightest chance...

333
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,556
Are you trying
to tell me

334
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,928
that you won't
kill me?

335
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,997
I'm sorry, I can't.

336
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,504
Don't you understand?
I'm finally onto something here.

337
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,507
And if I just,
just keep digging,

338
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,771
maybe I'll...
maybe I'll find an answer.

339
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,836
I'm very disappointed
in you, Omar.

340
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,109
Well, I know, but wait,
but this is Oz.

341
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,116
It's full of murderers.

342
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,210
Maybe you can convince
somebody else.

343
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,187
No no,
that's all right.

344
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,554
I have
an alternative plan.

345
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,056
Count!

346
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,911
What the hell?
Murphy, get down here!

347
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,445
Cuff him.

348
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,030
Holy fuck.

349
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,090
Jesus fucking Christ.

350
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,512
They say one man's trash
is another man's treasure.

351
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,345
Like fish
in the sea,

352
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,648
we take something someone else
doesn't want and repurpose it.

353
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,087
We go to antique stores
and auction houses paying top dollar,

354
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,988
proud to have
captured the prize.

355
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,324
But when someone you love dies,
the stupidest object,

356
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,023
their keychain,
a torn sweatshirt,

357
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,793
suddenly becomes
very special.

358
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,461
An icon
to be venerated.

359
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,732
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

360
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,506
Have a seat, James.

361
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,638
What is it?

362
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,377
The physical you
took last month.

363
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,750
I got the results back,
your blood test.

364
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,652
Oh, shit.

365
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,817
I think you should
have a seat, James.

366
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,425
Don't tell me.
I got AIDS?

367
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,453
You're H.I.V. Positive,

368
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,466
which does not necessarily
mean you have AIDS.

369
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,560
Jesus Christ!

370
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,798
The treatment
available today

371
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,396
do wonders for people
fighting H.I.V.

372
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,601
Thousands of patients
are leading normal lives.

373
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,110
Are you hearing me?

374
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,074
Promise you
won't tell anyone.

375
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,086
- Not anyone.
- No, of course I won't.

376
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,351
Files...
destroy the files.

377
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,688
I can't do that.

378
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,660
I can.

379
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,171
Lunch,
little brother.

380
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,401
Is it Fluffernutter?

381
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,432
Not this time, sport.

382
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,240
- He's doing fine.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,274
You know, he's still
completely unaware

384
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,115
that he was
almost executed.

385
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,553
I don't know if we can get away
with the charade the next time.

386
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,955
Cyril's gonna be fine.
He's not gonna die.

387
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,324
Ryan, the court didn't
overturn the death sentence.

388
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,091
One justice ruled for a stay,
and that's all.

389
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,758
No.

390
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,597
I prayed,
God listened.

391
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,001
- He saved Cyril's life, that's it.
- Ryan.

392
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,472
Hey, Ma, have a little
faith, all right?

393
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,974
I will.

394
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,046
Look, fuck stick,
I don't make the food.

395
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,015
All right,
I just serve it.

396
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,951
Ryan?

397
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,853
If you're finished,
I'd like to see you.

398
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,662
I don't know
if you're aware

399
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,667
that I was
the attending doctor

400
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,328
for your
brother's execution.

401
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,064
No.

402
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,369
Well, I agreed to be there
in case Cyril needed something.

403
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:53,969
- I appreciate that.
- Then as they were strapping him in,

404
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:58,142
I suddenly had this
flash of my husband...

405
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,623
And the horrible way that
he died at Cyril's hands,

406
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:09,718
and I thought, "Good,
I'm glad that I'm here to watch."

407
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:14,061
I can appreciate
that, too.

408
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,624
Well, I can't.

409
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:20,468
Revenge is not justice.

410
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,700
You know,
I'm a doctor.

411
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,972
I heal people.
I save lives.

412
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,809
I shouldn't feel happy
at the moment of...

413
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,873
of another person's
death, anyone's.

414
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,510
Not even the man
who killed my husband.

415
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,757
You know, Gloria,
I've been thinking,

416
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:45,024
I really need
to do something

417
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,555
to balance out all the...

418
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
all the shit
that I've done.

419
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:55,234
And I'd really like
to come work

420
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,104
in the hospital.

421
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,043
Ryan.

422
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,013
No.
Not to be near you.

423
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,073
Or just
to be near you.

424
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,014
Ever since I washed
Father Meehan's body,

425
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,616
I've...

426
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,422
I don't know.

427
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,296
I've spent
so much time

428
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,357
trying to stay alive
here in Oz.

429
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,768
All my energy has been
focused on my survival.

430
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,968
And I'm fucking
good at it.

431
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:36,113
So I'm thinking maybe
it's time for me to help others survive.

432
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,913
It's no scam.

433
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,647
I swear to you,
on my brother's life.

434
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,124
I believe you.

435
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,285
You do?

436
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,595
I'll request
the transfer.

437
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,723
Thank you.

438
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,127
Prisoner #03P138:

439
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,687
Seamus O'Reily;

440
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,756
Convicted
February 3, 2003,

441
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,768
murder in
the first degree;

442
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,531
sentence: 34 years;

443
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,505
Up for parole in 16.

444
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,774
- Yo.
- Dad's coming to visit?

445
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,607
Well, not visit,
exactly.

446
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,998
That's one sad-looking
plant there, McManus.

447
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:05,765
Well, it's supposed to survive
without natural light,

448
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,465
but, aw, fuck it.

449
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,996
Look, I'm here
about my dad.

450
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,941
I don't want Seamus O'Reily
in Em City.

451
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,308
- I don't want him here, either.
- You don't?

452
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,870
No. I just came up here
to make sure that

453
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,850
you weren't gonna do the right thing,
try to reunite us

454
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,875
or some kind of
bullshit like that.

455
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,253
I don't want that old
bastard anywhere near me.

456
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,234
- Welcome to Oz.
- Fuck you.

457
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,839
Forget about having
too much garbage,

458
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,609
too many bottles, cans,
watermelon rinds,

459
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,707
disposable baby diapers
and such.

460
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,342
What's really terrifying

461
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,785
in terms of the long-term
health of the planet

462
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,482
is toxic waste.

463
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,889
Toxic waste.

464
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,951
You can't put two worse words
together except maybe...

465
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,327
nuclear war.

466
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,293
"It will have blood,
they say.

467
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,203
Blood will have blood.

468
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:18,767
Stones have been known
to move and trees to speak.

469
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,576
Augurs and understood relations
have by maggot-pies

470
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,639
and choughs and rooks
brought forth

471
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,650
the secret'st man
of blood."

472
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,051
That's very good, Vern.
You have a natural gift.

473
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,455
Acting is often about
making a lie ring true.

474
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:37,291
- So do I get the role?
- Sure.

475
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,922
I'm just a little surprised that you're
so enthusiastic about it,

476
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,866
considering that we've had
so much trouble with people dying.

477
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,837
Taking this part now proves I've got
bigger balls than anybody in Oz.

478
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,833
I've come
to audition.

479
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,571
Too late, Beecher.

480
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,670
Yeah.
I got the part.

481
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,578
Oh, all right.

482
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:01,642
Oh, no, wait. My Macduff
got sent to solitary yesterday,

483
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,654
so how'd you like
to try out for that?

484
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,553
Sure.

485
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,151
Read this.

486
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,186
So, this is where Macduff
learns that Macbeth

487
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,597
has killed
his wife and son.

488
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:24,001
"Sinful Macduff,
they were all struck for thee!

489
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,340
Naught that I am,

490
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,312
not for their own demerits

491
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,180
but for mine fell slaughter
on their souls.

492
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,419
Heaven rest them now."

493
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,297
How'd the audition go?

494
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,131
You're looking at
the new Macbeth.

495
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,002
Still a couple of roles open.
You ought to try out.

496
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,006
No, I don't like
wearing makeup.

497
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,406
I like being backstage,
though.

498
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,877
I'm gonna help out
with props.

499
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,244
Oh, wow,
wish I had my camera.

500
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,511
This is
a Kodak moment.

501
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,643
Keep walking, Beecher.
No one's talking to you.

502
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,052
You know, Schillinger,
I am really surprised at you,

503
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,320
associating
with this fuck.

504
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,123
After all, he killed one
of your Aryan brothers.

505
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,560
What are you
jawing about?

506
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,860
Franklin Winthrop.

507
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,890
Killer Keller
snapped his neck.

508
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:28,395
- He's lying.
- Of course he is.

509
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,501
Why would Keller
want to whack Winthrop?

510
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:37,344
He did the deed
for me,

511
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,282
out of love,

512
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,184
to avenge
my father's murder.

513
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,211
Guard! Guard!

514
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:54,293
Any of this ring
a fucking bell, huh, Vern?

515
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,233
God damn you.

516
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,568
Look at that,
I can still cry.

517
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,666
You know what?
I'm proud of that.

518
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,511
You pussy ass bitch.

519
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,209
- Shh.
- Don't shush me, motherfucker.

520
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,914
Chris, you did
kill Winthrop.

521
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,421
Yeah.

522
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,016
That's okay.
He was nothing.

523
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,721
But Beecher knows
too much about both of us.

524
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,422
He's gotta die.

525
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,933
Yeah.

526
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,060
I'll deal with it.

527
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,196
No, I'll kill Beecher.

528
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,933
You?

529
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,509
Before I whack him,

530
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,776
I just want to fuck him
in the ass one more time.

531
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,076
Hello?

532
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,086
Suzanne told me to tell you
to wait for her here.

533
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,070
I love props.

534
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,604
What looks
real, isn't.

535
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,876
Like this shank.

536
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,544
Hah! See that?
It's fake.

537
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,614
At least I know I got
your attention now, though.

538
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,329
I'm trying
to learn my lines.

539
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:36,527
He speaks and yet he says nothing.
What of that?

540
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,161
Shut up.

541
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,637
Oh, okay.

542
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:45,506
You know, I've always thought
actions speak louder than words anyway.

543
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:49,070
Now, this one's real.

544
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,586
By the way,
these are real, too.

545
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,358
- Hey, Suzanne. Late for rehearsal?
- Hey.

546
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,700
Well, no, doesn't
start till 3:00.

547
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,366
I got a note from you
asking me to let Beecher out early

548
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,375
for a catch-up
rehearsal.

549
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,206
I didn't write
any note.

550
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,226
Time to wake up, Toby.

551
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,421
You fucking cocksucker!

552
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,727
Shh.

553
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,929
It's just like the old days, huh?
You as my bitch.

554
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,563
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me.

555
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,603
Fake... real.

556
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,217
Or did I get them
mixed up?

557
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,947
Let's see.

558
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,760
Hope I got your
attention now.

559
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,322
Toby...

560
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,459
Schillinger
wants you dead.

561
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,935
That's no secret,
right?

562
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,600
I told him that
I would do it.

563
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,973
Ask me why.

564
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,716
- Why?
- To keep you alive.

565
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,945
That's right.

566
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,513
I've been pretending to be
Schillinger's butt buddy

567
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,118
to keep you safe.

568
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,596
So that you and I
would know of his plans.

569
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,030
But I know how...

570
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,503
bullheaded you are.

571
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,135
I knew that if I had told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

572
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,373
I concocted this
whole goddamn thing

573
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,043
just to convince you that
I'm on the up and up.

574
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,521
Now, if I was really siding

575
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,992
with Schillinger, Toby...

576
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,497
you'd be dead
already.

577
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,693
But instead...

578
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,595
all I really want...

579
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,068
is for you
to love me again.

580
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,948
What the fuck
is going on here?

581
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:42,476
Just a little harmless fun
between two consenting adults.

582
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:02,335
So does Beecher believe
you're betraying me?

583
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,341
Motherfucker doesn't
know what to believe.

584
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,674
I'll fill in the rest
as we go along.

585
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,579
He's so proud of his tears.
We'll give him something to cry about.

586
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,364
Junk is garbage.

587
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,391
We Americans dump
400,000 tons of garbage

588
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,528
every day in over
6,000 landfills.

589
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,404
Problem is, as the population
keeps growing,

590
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,601
the amount of
available space diminishes.

591
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,109
Remember
a few years ago

592
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,044
that barge that kept
sailing around

593
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,639
'cause no one wanted to accept
its decaying cargo?

594
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,412
Lmagine a future
full of ships,

595
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,181
detritus stinking
to high heaven

596
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,882
trying to find a port.

597
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,949
How'd it go?

598
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,484
They rejected
my parole.

599
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,295
Yeah, my wife and I are
retiring to Sarasota, Florida.

600
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,733
- Nice.
- Luis,

601
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,737
can I have a moment
of your time, please?

602
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,864
- Sure, um...
- We'll wait for you in the lobby.

603
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:13,206
- Okay.
- Um, Miguel Alvarez,

604
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,907
- I want you to have a meeting with him.
- Why?

605
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,074
Well, so that
he can apologize to you

606
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,084
for hitting you
at the last hearing.

607
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,211
Does this have anything
to do with me taking over

608
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,449
as head of the parole board
when Steve retires?

609
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,150
No, this has to do
with a guy

610
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,422
who's making a genuine
attempt to be rehabilitated.

611
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,157
Look, I see Miguel
every day.

612
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,461
You see him once
every three years.

613
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,127
I believe
he's changed.

614
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,070
Give him a chance
to prove that to you.

615
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,630
- I'll think about it.
- Please!

616
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,665
I'll think
about it, Tim.

617
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,018
He said no?

618
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,052
He said maybe.

619
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,656
Oh. I guess
that's something.

620
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,066
The key, Miguel,
is keep on track.

621
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,502
Don't get sucked up
in all this shit.

622
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,506
- I'm trying.
- I know.

623
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,168
- It's fucking hard.
- I know.

624
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,815
Hello, Miguel.

625
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,294
Hey, Cathy Jo.

626
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,560
How are you?

627
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,159
I'll be better when
we finish this legal stuff.

628
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,465
The lawyer says
once you sign these,

629
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,029
all of Wolfgang's
property is mine.

630
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,304
You look beautiful.

631
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,105
Thank you.

632
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,050
You know, I didn't...
I didn't know Cutler that well,

633
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,316
but he's gotta
be a dope

634
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,620
for treating you
the way he did, you know?

635
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,056
If it was me,

636
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,086
I'd worship
at your feet.

637
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,001
I guess we should
deal with this.

638
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,966
Then again,
what's the rush?

639
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,718
None.

640
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,088
None fucking at all.

641
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,996
I heard Cathy Jo
visited again.

642
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,000
That mean you signed all
the property over to her?

643
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,592
Not exactly.

644
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,830
It's either yes
or no, Alvarez.

645
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,773
Or it's not exactly. She isn't sure
that she wants everything.

646
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,208
- What the fuck does that mean?
- I don't know.

647
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,973
Says she wants
more time.

648
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,809
Give her time.

649
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,542
All right,
just get it done.

650
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,075
Hey, I'm just doing what the widow wants.
It's just like you asked.

651
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,646
Jesus, you guys
gotta calm down.

652
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,684
I don't trust
that little spic.

653
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,891
Next time she comes,
I want a mole in that room.

654
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,094
I don't think
I trust her, either.

655
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,067
Prisoner #03T323,

656
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,511
Alonzo Torquemada.

657
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,751
Convicted
February 6, 2003,

658
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,624
assault in
the first degree;

659
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:55,564
sentence: 10 years;
Up for parole in six.

660
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,049
Who the fuck
is that?

661
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,356
It's Torquemada,
a club owner.

662
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,761
The king
of the night.

663
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,787
Miguel Alvarez.

664
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,791
I hear you're
the man to know.

665
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,191
Whoever told you
that was an idiot.

666
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,218
Quieres festejar?

667
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,197
No, thank you.

668
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,426
I hate heroin.

669
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,766
Oh, I ain't talking about
that street shit, sweetie.

670
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:10,570
I'm talking the latest
in synthetics.

671
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,143
You ever done destiny?

672
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,273
D-tabs.

673
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:22,411
Like a 6-month
Mardi Gras.

674
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,751
I'm up for parole
in a couple.

675
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:28,554
I'm gonna keep my record
and my head clean.

676
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,856
I like you.

677
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,761
You're smart.

678
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,233
You can be
my numero dos.

679
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,326
That's funny.

680
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,462
Of the drag queens?

681
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,598
Oh, no.

682
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,608
I intend to run
all of Em City.

683
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,633
You want Em City?

684
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,374
You gonna beat the wops?
You gonna beat the niggers?

685
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,972
That's right.

686
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,576
Taken one too many
of them d-tabs, baby.

687
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,849
Trust me, Miguel,

688
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,346
once the boys get their
hands on this shit...

689
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,222
every con in Oz
will be mine.

690
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,159
Mmm.

691
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,070
Junk is also classic slang
for narcotics,

692
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,475
usually heroin.

693
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,309
The people using
are junkies,

694
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,542
and as a result,
lives can be destroyed.

695
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,016
Junk bonds cause
financial disaster.

696
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,679
Junk food brings
nutritional ruin.

697
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,451
Junk mail is just
plain irritating.

698
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,390
Our lives are
filled with dreck.

699
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,586
But the hardest dreck
of all to clear away

700
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,062
is the one of
our own making.

701
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,939
Yood...

702
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,442
I'm gonna ask you again,
and this time I want the truth.

703
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,911
Did you see who murdered
Willy Brandt?

704
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,675
No.

705
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:00,342
It happened right here.
You were somewhere in the area.

706
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,284
How could you
not have noticed?

707
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,811
What I saw, I saw.

708
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,620
What I'll say
is another matter.

709
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,451
I could force you.

710
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,497
Warden,

711
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,865
I'm smart enough
to know that what happened here

712
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,531
is a small thing that's tied
to the tail of a dragon.

713
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:27,169
My advice is to forget about
who killed Willy Brandt

714
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,008
and who killed
Mayor Loewen.

715
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,014
Move on before
that dragon comes out

716
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,073
and bites you
in the ass.

717
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,822
Officer Johnson,
what can I do for you today?

718
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,267
- Another job.
- Oh, Jeez.

719
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,236
Last one, Lionel.

720
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,535
That's what you said
when I killed Willy Brandt.

721
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,167
Brandt was small potatoes
compared to this.

722
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,074
Yeah? Who?

723
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,183
Oh, Jeez.

724
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,453
Guess what,
I found out

725
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,359
who's getting the Correctional
Officers Association's

726
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,195
lifetime achievement award
at tonight's banquet.

727
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,032
For 34 years dedicated service,
courage and calm,

728
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,266
the award goes
to Leo Glynn.

729
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,702
Congratulations.

730
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,076
No one deserves this
recognition more than you.

731
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,546
Yeah, right.

732
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,414
You know as well as I
the only criterion

733
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,475
for the lifetime achievement
award is survival.

734
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,046
Ooh, we've gotta get you
to loosened up for tonight.

735
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,989
Well, I'm not
gonna loosen up

736
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,552
until I put Wilson Loewen's
murderer behind bars.

737
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,489
Brandt murdered Loewen
and now Brandt's dead.

738
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,866
He's dead because someone
didn't want Brandt testifying

739
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,841
as to who paid him
to kill Loewen.

740
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,242
Oh.

741
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,679
Hey, Leo, I need to
ask you a couple of ques...

742
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,582
Wow.

743
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,219
Tim, come back here.

744
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,678
Ha-ha.

745
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,374
Last time I wore
this getup was...

746
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,405
was at your
40th birthday party.

747
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,112
Oh, jeez, thanks for
reminding me, Sean.

748
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,414
I wasn't
feeling lousy enough.

749
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,422
I was thinking of
heading over, you know,

750
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,516
have a couple of belts
before all the droning.

751
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,151
Huh?

752
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,425
Rumor is Leo's gonna get
the lifetime achievement award.

753
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,967
Ceremony's in a half-hour,
you know that, right?

754
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,903
Yup.

755
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,872
So, what's the problem?

756
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,999
Little Tim need help
with his clip-on?

757
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,875
Come here.

758
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,081
I think there's gonna be
trouble in Em City tonight.

759
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,086
Sure, but no more
than usual.

760
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,056
Yeah, but, you know,
maybe I should stay here

761
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,853
just in case.

762
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,553
Do you not want
to go to the party?

763
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,459
Well, what the fuck
do you think?

764
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,657
I think you must
really love your job

765
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,724
or hate your boss.

766
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,202
Count!

767
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,262
I'm gonna party.

768
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,305
98A498,

769
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,341
92M220,

770
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,910
97 A413...

771
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,498
Listen, shouldn't we...

772
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,906
shouldn't we get
the show on the road?

773
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,375
Not without Leo.

774
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,537
- Yeah, where is he?
- I'll get him.

775
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,951
You should slow down.

776
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,509
Oh, boy.

777
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,257
Leo?

778
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,536
Leo?

779
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,840
Leo?

780
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,913
Jesus.

781
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,439
Leo!

782
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,138
Officer,
call code one!

783
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,204
Turn off that music!

784
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,272
Turn off that
fucking music!

785
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,716
Get that gurney here!

786
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,777
Leo, can you hear me?

787
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,322
I can't feel
his pulse.

788
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,596
Oh my God,
he's dead.

789
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,144
You know how to get out
of any labyrinth?

790
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:43,448
No, Tim, I don't.

791
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,148
Well, the second
that you go in,

792
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:49,124
you just put
your hand on the wall

793
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,650
and then you walk.

794
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,095
And as long as you keep
your hand on the wall,

795
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,098
you'll get out.

796
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,862
But this maze,

797
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:03,032
the one that I designed,
it doesn't have any walls.

798
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,205
I don't understand
why you and Leo

799
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,341
being together
bothered me so much.

800
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,647
I mean, the whole point
of our divorce

801
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,516
is so we could
both be happy, right?

802
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:20,114
Now neither of us is.

803
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,254
You know what I miss most
about being married to you?

804
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,859
You always knew
how to comfort me.

805
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,435
I loved him so much.

806
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,027
According to statistics

807
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,227
from the United States
Bureau of Justice,

808
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,133
the prison population
has grown

809
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,571
by almost 550,000
since 1991.

810
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,701
That's an increase of 69%.

811
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:17,907
Junkyard, prison,
same difference.

812
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,677
Only in prison,
the junk we're discarding,

813
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,685
the flotsam and jetsam,

814
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,710
are human lives.
