1
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:41,744
Every person on the planet was raised
to believe some version of the truth,

2
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:45,878
about God, about morality, mortality,
about the purpose of life.

3
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,387
We usually call
those beliefs religion.

4
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:51,186
And if over the course of living
those beliefs break down,

5
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:54,318
if they prove themselves
not to be true,

6
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,923
we search for a new religion
to follow and we convert.

7
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,526
Now that conversion
can be traumatic,

8
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,696
not only for ourselves,
our souls,

9
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:07,229
but for those around us.

10
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:11,073
Can l have
your attention?

11
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:15,411
Everybody's
attention, please!

12
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:20,250
ln my ongoing effort to improve
the quality of your lives,

13
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,448
l'm instituting
a couple of new programs.

14
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,391
Starting today, once a week,
we're going to show you

15
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:30,362
an instructional video
for one half-hour of TV time.

16
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:32,388
Yes, yes,

17
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,195
And attendance is mandatory.

18
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,537
Hey, hey,
l wanna hear silence.

19
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,439
Over there is
another idea of mine.

20
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:46,908
Now, when you
violate the rules,

21
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:48,915
instead of sending you
to the hole,

22
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,814
we're going to stick you
inside that cage

23
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,648
in full view of your adoring public.

24
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:56,349
- Any questions?
- Yes, Mr. McManus, sir.

25
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,189
How big is your penis?

26
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:02,024
Funny. Keller,

27
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,463
you get the honor of being
the first slug inside the cage.

28
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:10,268
- Keller!
- Way to go!

29
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:13,232
You faggot.

30
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,070
Hey, you need to take a shit?

31
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,099
Hey, fella,
it ain't that bad.

32
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,973
All right, everybody else
find a seat.

33
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:24,279
Here's the first video.
Let her rip.

34
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,453
Life is like a house.

35
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,751
Sure you can paint
and decorate it alone,

36
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,316
but then only you'll
appreciate it. Others won't.

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,852
And don't you want them to?
That's what community is for.

38
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,095
- Hey, you outta here?
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:48,335
Hey, yo, you tell everybody in Emerald
City that Supreme Allah is not done.

40
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,401
You hear me? Tell them Supreme Allah is
coming back, he's coming back strong.

41
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,844
- Quiet down, Ketchum.
- The murderous bond. Let them know.

42
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,745
- Let's go.
- l got you out of solitary

43
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:58,876
- because you said you want to change.
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,080
Well, l'm giving you
that chance, Omar,

45
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,214
and l'm going to do
whatever l can to help.

46
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:06,487
- But l need you off the drugs.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:10,826
You screw up again, l'm going to send
you right back to solitary.

48
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,263
Do you understand?

49
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,823
Uh-huh.

50
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,464
Okay.

51
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,199
Shit, he called me
a drug abuser, man.

52
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,831
l ain't no drug abuser,
Jack.

53
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:24,105
l mean, truth be told, son,
l treat my drugs better than most.

54
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,112
Now he wants me
to go to rehab.

55
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,943
Rehab is cool, man.

56
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,573
You get to talk about
yourself a lot.

57
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,311
Well, l'm doing--
what, 17 to life?

58
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,149
By the time l get out of this,
there ain't be shit to recover.

59
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:37,486
You know what
l'm saying, son?

60
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:40,925
Miguel Alvarez, a fugitive from
the Oswald State Correctional Facility

61
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,191
for the past six months,
has been captured.

62
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,925
Customs agents near
Nogales, Arizona,

63
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:48,059
found Alvarez
late last night as he tried

64
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,365
to cross the border
into Mexico.

65
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,701
- ln other news...
- Alvarez is coming back.

66
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,503
- So?
- The motherfucker tried to kill me.

67
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,772
Yeah, only because
you tried to kill him.

68
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,745
Or did l get
the story wrong?

69
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,449
You let it go, Chico.

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,095
How you doing, Glynn?
You miss me?

71
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,896
No.

72
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,096
You know,
l almost made it.

73
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,400
l almost made it
into Mexico.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,305
We would have
found you there.

75
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,674
l don't think so.

76
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,112
You know, l would have made my way
to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia,

77
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:38,675
walked the Andes
through Chile

78
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,653
to light this little spark
called Tierra del Fuego.

79
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,020
You know about
Tierra del Fuego?

80
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:46,116
- lt's the end of the earth.
- That's right.

81
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,150
You would have gone
that far to capture me?

82
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,752
The end of the earth?

83
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,491
Probably not.

84
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:54,959
Next time.

85
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:57,401
Take him to solitary.

86
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,843
What's up, man?

87
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,942
Keep moving.

88
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,761
- Who's that?
- What's it matter?

89
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:29,326
l just like to know the quality
of criminal l'm neighboring with.

90
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,338
He's a wank job,
just like you.

91
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,154
Shit.

92
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,695
- Put something in Alvarez's food?
- Like what?

93
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,501
l don't know, rat poison or something.

94
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,370
Look, the point is,
you kill him, Omar,

95
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,876
l'll see that you get
all the fucking tits you need.

96
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,878
Huh? What do you say?

97
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:17,474
- No.
- No? Why no?

98
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:19,985
l just don't like you.

99
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,646
You don't like me?

100
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,588
l can't put
my finger on it.

101
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:26,114
l don't know if it's
the way you look...

102
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,389
the way you smell,
your breath, the way you talk.

103
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:32,262
l don't know, but there's just something
about you just rubs me the wrong way.

104
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:35,358
Yeah? Well,
fuck you, nigger.

105
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,463
Oh, fuck!

106
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,533
- All right.
- Call the warden!

107
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,407
- All right.
- Do not resist.

108
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:49,609
Don't let-- don't let--
help me!

109
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:53,050
We've got a 66
in the kitchen, a code 66.

110
00:07:58,258 --> 00:07:59,850
- You back?
- Uh-huh.

111
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,726
Fuck, nigger, that got to be some kind
of record or something.

112
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:06,425
- You Alvarez?
- Yeah.

113
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,363
You owe me, dog.

114
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:10,596
lnside.

115
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,435
- Claire?
- Yeah?

116
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,174
- Hey, how much do you love me?
- Plenty.

117
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:25,207
- Yeah? Enough to do anything l ask?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,548
Yeah? Thattagirl.
Come on.

119
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,679
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

120
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,951
- You fucked Howell?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,051
You just don't drop a nugget like that
without a few details, O'Reily.

122
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:39,121
We had sex maybe five times in the
ladies' toilet off the interview room.

123
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:41,565
She got weird.

124
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,798
What do you mean weird?
Weird, like possessive weird?

125
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,100
Yeah.

126
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,336
So when McManus came back
and took over Em City

127
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:54,335
and shipped her off to Unit J,
l was, to say at the least, relieved.

128
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,610
l haven't seen
much of her since.

129
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,982
My esteem for you
has risen 69°/%,

130
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,852
but tell me, as one
manipulative turd to another,

131
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,019
did you fuck Howell for the sex or get
her to do some other kind of nasty?

132
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,961
Just the sex.

133
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,464
Check.

134
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,099
Fuck.

135
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,742
- Don't you be winking at me!
- What?

136
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,183
- Claire!
- The fucking bastard's winking at me.

137
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,777
- Take him to the hole!
- That's bullshit!

138
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,049
Take him to the hole.

139
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,386
- Mineo.
- Joe.

140
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,856
All right, all right.

141
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,452
- But you're filling out the paperwork.
- Mineo.

142
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,962
What? You fucking dyke!

143
00:09:56,643 --> 00:10:00,340
- Ryan, have you missed me?
- Oh, Christ.

144
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,815
- Dr. Nathan, welcome back.
- Thanks, it's good to be back.

145
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:22,866
Oh no, l wanted to put these
on your desk before you arrived.

146
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:25,029
Oh, Pete.

147
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:27,301
- Hi.
- Wow! You look great.

148
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,570
- Thanks. l feel great.
- Yeah?

149
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:32,806
You know, renewed, ready to jump back
into the job with both feet.

150
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,813
Listen, l've got six seconds
before group.

151
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,839
So let's meet later and review
the current cases, okay?

152
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,351
- Bienvenida!
- Gracias.

153
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,482
Dr. Nathan, we need you.

154
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,456
- This guy took a shank to the face.
- Uh, gloves.

155
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,355
The other guy
wasn't as lucky.

156
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:50,260
- Cyril O'Reily.
- l heard what he did to that news guy,

157
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,161
Jack Eldridge,
nearly beating him to death.

158
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,790
Cyril's condition is only
getting worse.

159
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,269
We can't find the right balance
of medication.

160
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,861
Hmm... l'd like
to examine him.

161
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,133
Can you arrange that,
Tim?

162
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,606
Sure.

163
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:02,938
So who's next?

164
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,136
l think that's it.

165
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,145
Okay, l'm off to group.

166
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,976
- Okay, see you.
- Bye.

167
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,642
What are you doing?
Want to have some dinner?

168
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,480
Nah.

169
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,782
Well, l really
only mean dinner.

170
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,153
l know.
Rain check, okay?

171
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,590
- See you.
- See you.

172
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,497
Okay, good.
Put your shirt on.

173
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,235
Dr. Nathan,
where you been?

174
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,830
l took a few months off,
a little vacation.

175
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:38,633
- After you got raped?
- Ah, yeah.

176
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:43,441
- l wish l could have.
- Could have what?

177
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,747
Taken a vacation
after l got raped.

178
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:50,288
lt was okay, though.
l had Ryan to help me.

179
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,723
Yeah, he's a very
helpful guy.

180
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,590
l wish l could
help him.

181
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,151
He's sick.

182
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,754
When he was in the hole,
he got a cold.

183
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,491
You can take him back.

184
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,501
For Christ's sake, O'Reily,
quit coughing on the food.

185
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,407
You're going to get
the whole fucking prison sick.

186
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,878
- Relax, l'm not contagious anymore.
- Yeah.

187
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,676
Fuck.

188
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,887
Hey, on second thought...

189
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,358
l'm not feeling so hot after all.
l got to go to the infirmary.

190
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,666
Deep breath.

191
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:42,902
Again.

192
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,504
Yeah, you do
sound congested.

193
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,447
Give him a hit of albuterol.
Let's keep him overnight.

194
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,744
Follow me.

195
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,925
- Welcome back.
- Huh?

196
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:09,128
- Welcome back.
- Oh thanks, Claire.

197
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,028
l just wanted you to know...

198
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,506
l've been taking good care
of Ryan O'Reily for you.

199
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:20,843
- What do you mean?
- You know, giving him a helping hand.

200
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,398
Get back in bed.

201
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,272
No, that's okay, Benny.

202
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,367
l want to talk to him.

203
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,779
But stay nearby.

204
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,984
- Are you feeling better?
- Uh-huh.

205
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,718
Did you send me this?

206
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,721
Yes.

207
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,133
You killed him,
didn't you, Keenan?

208
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,031
Yes.

209
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,839
You admit to murdering him
even though you know

210
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,176
l could tell the warden
that you confessed,

211
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,772
and you'd probably
end up on death row?

212
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:33,842
Keenan raped you.
He didn't deserve to breathe.

213
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:36,616
lf l have to die
because of that--

214
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:42,057
okay, kill me.

215
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,152
Go to bed.

216
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,728
l love you.

217
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:51,202
Benny, Carl,
we're finished.

218
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,879
l've hated Ryan O'Reily
for so long,

219
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,259
so deeply.

220
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:17,888
He's responsible
for the death of my husband,

221
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,989
but he did it
out love for me.

222
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,761
And Keenan, too.
All for me.

223
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,132
He loves me more
than Preston ever did.

224
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,197
Ryan's love is...

225
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,642
enormous, overwhelming,

226
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:34,271
unconditional, undying.

227
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,072
Am l crazy
to push him away or--

228
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,415
Gloria, listen to yourself.

229
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:44,617
His love is anything
but unconditional,

230
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,524
and often anything but love.

231
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,896
Now look, the feelings
he has for you are dangerous.

232
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,730
He is dangerous.
And for you to encourage him,

233
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,100
given that you don't
share those feelings--

234
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:00,332
But l do.

235
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,035
l do share his feelings.

236
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,041
God help me.

237
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,879
l love Ryan O'Reily.

238
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,232
When Christopher Columbus
landed in the New World,

239
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:39,801
a Catholic priest
was right alongside him.

240
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,575
From then on, priests kept coming over
to this continent

241
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:46,312
trying to convert the lndians, trying
to get them to kiss the crucifix,

242
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:50,220
to stop smoking peyote,
to cover up their nakedness.

243
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:53,783
The lndians responded
with great enthusiasm.

244
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:56,420
They maimed, tortured
and burned the priests...

245
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:59,124
and then offered
the bodies up their own gods.

246
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,898
What's this?

247
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:09,340
James Devlin is about to get inaugurated
for his second term as Governor.

248
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,808
Hey, change the station.

249
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:12,140
lt won't do no good.

250
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:14,271
The scumfuck's
on every channel.

251
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:18,147
Yeah, we need to petition the warden
to get us some cable up in here.

252
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:21,642
Augustus, he's got
wheels like you.

253
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:24,451
Will you look at that?

254
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,386
l do solemnly swear,

255
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,086
to execute the office
of Governor

256
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:29,492
to the best of my
abilities,

257
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,827
and to preserve,
protect and defend

258
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,095
the Constitution
of this state,

259
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:41,073
with equality and justice
for all, so help me God.

260
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,303
Wishing you were up there?

261
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,946
Neil Bourne will make
a great lieutenant governor.

262
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,709
That's not what l asked.

263
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:52,240
Do you regret
dropping out of the race?

264
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,183
- Nope.
- Good.

265
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,688
Warden?

266
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,656
Barry Levine
on line two.

267
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:02,889
- Who's Barry Levine?
- l don't know. He says he knows you.

268
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:05,624
Barry Levine?

269
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,598
He wants to talk with you
about the warden's conference.

270
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,568
Oh, you mean
Barney Levin?

271
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:11,900
Oh, maybe that's
what he said.

272
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:14,872
Look, tell him
l'll call him back later.

273
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,499
And use
the goddamn intercom.

274
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,373
Yes, sir.

275
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,812
Man, Busmalis is
driving me crazy.

276
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,508
He's the worst
assistant l've ever had.

277
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,110
He gets numbers wrong,
he-- he screws up appointments,

278
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,884
l'm hosting the regional conference
of the Wardens Association next week,

279
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:34,415
and he has managed
to mangle every detail.

280
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,860
- Get another prisoner to assist you.
- Who?

281
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,659
How many drug dealers
can use Excel?

282
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,858
Hire someone from outside.

283
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,629
Every time l do they
end up quitting.

284
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,863
They get jumpy
working here.

285
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,702
l need to find
somebody who's...

286
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,141
smart, funny,
diplomatic...

287
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:52,872
and fearless.

288
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:55,506
l may have
the perfect person,

289
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,712
a woman l met doing volunteer work
at a homeless shelter.

290
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:01,845
Her name
is Floria Mills.

291
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:05,823
- l'm not late, am l?
- No, you're right on time.

292
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,826
Oh my car broke down
on the expressway.

293
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,522
l don't know why they call
that road expressway

294
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,394
cause the traffic
moves like snails.

295
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,127
Then l managed to hitch
a ride with a trucker,

296
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,862
only we got to talking
so we missed the exit ramp,

297
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:19,132
and then he didn't want
to come all the way up here.

298
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,332
Turns out he served four years
for armed robbery,

299
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:24,365
so l had to walk, which is why
l must look like yesterday's gumbo.

300
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,469
Here's my resume.

301
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,707
Do you always have
this much energy?

302
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:31,147
Actually, you caught me
on one of my slow days.

303
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,413
Congratulations, Floria.

304
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,444
- For what?
- You just got the job.

305
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,886
- Oh, l did?
- Yes.

306
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:50,593
Yeah, l understand the warden's former
assistant said we needed food for 20

307
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:54,299
but he made a miscalculation,
which l hope you'll help me correct.

308
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,205
Now, Carl,
nothing's impossible.

309
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,403
The governor is going to be
at the conference.

310
00:19:58,444 --> 00:19:59,934
You know if he likes
your catering,

311
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,970
you'll be working
state functions for years.

312
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:04,949
Oh thank you, Carl.
You're a sweetie.

313
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,795
Yeah?

314
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:28,937
Well, if it's okay,
l'm going home.

315
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:32,171
Sure. Good first day.

316
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:34,270
Oh, thanks,
l had fun.

317
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,749
Fun?

318
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,648
''Fun'' is not a word
l'd associate with Oz.

319
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:43,382
Warden, have you ever
thought about redecorating?

320
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:46,914
- Not really.
- Well, with your permission,

321
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,484
l'd like to make a few changes,
brighten things up,

322
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,053
- get new furniture.
- Okay.

323
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,964
Unless, of course, you think
your wife would mind.

324
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,696
l don't know the woman,
but l know that there are some wives

325
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:01,331
who take their husband's offices very
personally, if you know what l mean.

326
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:04,171
Mary won't mind, Floria.

327
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:07,303
At this point, she doesn't seem
to care much about what l do.

328
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,837
The fact is...

329
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:12,783
this morning, my wife and l
decided to separate.

330
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:16,652
Oh, Warden,
l am so sorry.

331
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,282
She asked me
to move out.

332
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,793
Do you have
somewhere to go?

333
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,387
No, l hadn't thought
about it.

334
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,694
Well, l'll call
you a hotel.

335
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:29,758
There's a Hyatt right over
on Bartlett and Third.

336
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:33,499
Don't bother. l'm going to sleep
on this couch tonight.

337
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,439
Do you think
that's wise?

338
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,572
You know, this may
sound odd, but...

339
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:42,377
sometimes the walls
around Oz

340
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,678
make me feel safe.

341
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,210
l don't know why
l'm telling you all this.

342
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:51,245
l haven't told anybody else.

343
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,555
- Good night, Warden.
- Call me Leo.

344
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:59,492
You go easy on
that stuff, Leo.

345
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,605
The warden fired me.

346
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,235
No thank you, no pat on the back,
just clear out your desk.

347
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:14,541
- Maybe it's all for the best.
- Best?

348
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,448
l'm back mopping floors,
scooping up poop, piss and vomit.

349
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:22,215
Do you think l love what l do?
Answering Miss Sally's e-mail,

350
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:24,518
forging her autograph
on photos?

351
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:28,822
l don't think it matters what we do
as long as we do our best.

352
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:32,592
Oh Norma, you have the best
perspective on the world.

353
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,564
These past few months,
you coming to visit,

354
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,900
they've meant
everything to me.

355
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:40,871
l'm glad, Agamemnon.

356
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:42,305
l want you to be happy.

357
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,571
When l'm with you,
l'm delirious.

358
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,541
l love you, Norma.

359
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,944
Will you marry me?

360
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,744
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

361
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,362
l want you to be
my best man.

362
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,261
Have you thought
this through?

363
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:08,664
Marriage is a big step,
a big commitment.

364
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:10,828
What kind of life
can you two have together,

365
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,837
you in here,
her out there?

366
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,839
l won't be in Oz
for long.

367
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,704
While you were in the hospital,
l started digging another tunnel.

368
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:30,586
You and me, old friend.

369
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:33,182
We'll dance the Hasapiko
at my wedding.

370
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:39,888
Saul was a soldier riding
his horse to Damascus

371
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:42,628
when all of a sudden
he saw a huge cross in the sky.

372
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:47,696
lnstantly, he changed the first letter
of his name to P, becoming Paul.

373
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,903
Why? l don't know.

374
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:54,879
Most of us ain't that lucky
seeing a cross in the sky.

375
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:59,111
For most of us, signs from God aren't
quite that clear.

376
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,711
''Put not God
with other gods,

377
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:05,520
for thou will sit
despised and forsaken.

378
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:10,017
Thy Lord has decreed that ye shall not
serve other than Him.

379
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,527
And kind--''

380
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,259
- What do you want?
- l need to talk to Minister Said.

381
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:20,637
Continue.

382
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,944
''And kindness
to one's parents,

383
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:28,446
- whether one or both of them--''
- Minister, please.

384
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,415
l want to become a Muslim.

385
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:35,877
Tidd, go away.

386
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:39,914
l know in the past that l've been fierce
hanging with Adebisi and stuff.

387
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:43,018
But when l saw him bleeding,

388
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:46,155
and you with that shank
in your hand,

389
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:48,223
l knew l had to change.

390
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:51,868
- l want to join you.
- Get up.

391
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:54,600
- Save me, Minister Said.
- l said get up!

392
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,599
Hey, hey!
What's going on?

393
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:02,011
- This man is harassing me.
- You causing trouble, Leroy?

394
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,447
- No.
- Then get your ass gone.

395
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,728
You know l've never
liked Leroy Tidd.

396
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,428
The man's done nothing
but flex since he came into Oz.

397
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:26,699
- But if his conversion is real, then--
- lt's not.

398
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:29,701
How do you know
for sure?

399
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,767
Now, you of all people,

400
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:35,609
you're going to question
my ability to judge others?

401
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,309
- You?
- No.

402
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,982
- Things are as you say they are.
- Good.

403
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,391
And l don't want
no more talk about Leroy Tidd.

404
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,526
l am a fiend.

405
00:25:56,568 --> 00:26:01,232
l'm also a liar,
a thief, a--

406
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:04,333
l just want to turn my life backwards.
You know what l mean?

407
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:07,709
But 'cause l've been hard,
no one fucking believes me.

408
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:12,075
- We believe you, Leroy. Don't we?
- Oh yeah.

409
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:14,449
l believe him.

410
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:24,394
This guy, Leroy Tidd,
l think he is genuinely sorry.

411
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,795
l think he genuinely
wants to change.

412
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,561
And you came to this
conclusion how?

413
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,000
He was in rehab today.

414
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,766
Many in Oz have used rehab,

415
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,569
have used lslam
for their own agenda.

416
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:39,099
Tidd is one of them.

417
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:41,544
You've embraced a lot
of men far worse than him.

418
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,946
Jefferson Keane,
Poet, Adebisi.

419
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:46,143
No! Not Adebisi!

420
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:52,490
- Oh, l see.
- Oh, you see?

421
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:56,688
- You see what?
- Tidd hung with Adebisi.

422
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:59,526
- You feel guilty having killed him.
- No!

423
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:02,124
l do not feel guilt!

424
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,727
l did the right thing.

425
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,635
l did what had to be done.

426
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,173
Jesus Christ.

427
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:12,142
That's what l said about
Andrew and Hank Schillinger.

428
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:16,443
Taking a life is acceptable as long
as it's excusable, right?

429
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,176
Beecher...

430
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,783
Get away from me.

431
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:36,295
So he says, ''Don't eat me.
Eat the nigger.''

432
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,678
What's the matter?
You don't think that's funny?

433
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:55,846
No. But you,

434
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:58,947
you're a joke.

435
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:06,824
- Get back!
- Fuck this!

436
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,730
Fight! Fight! Fight!

437
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:16,097
You fucker!
You motherfucking nigger.

438
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:18,840
Fucker!

439
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,983
Yo, Schillinger,
l want to talk to you.

440
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:30,511
Somebody tell him
l don't talk to--

441
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:33,285
what is the politically
correct term--

442
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,849
Jungle bunnies.

443
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,861
Oh you gonna want
to talk to me.

444
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:39,295
l saw the dust up
between your pals and the Muslims.

445
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,629
And l know
Said's to blame

446
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,464
for your boy Robson spending
a few days down the hole.

447
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:49,372
Now what l'm offering is
to take care of Said.

448
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:52,904
For the right amount of cash,
of course.

449
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:57,846
Will somebody tell him we can
take care of Said ourselves?

450
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:00,078
We don't need to subcontract.

451
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:04,179
And will somebody tell him
l'm going to get close to Said?

452
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,588
Close enough
to cut his throat.

453
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:13,722
Here, drink that.

454
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:18,332
So the doctor says
everything's okay?

455
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,272
Yeah, we did a sonogram.

456
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:24,138
- Do you want to see?
- Yeah.

457
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:33,081
- God.
- Mr. Schillinger, l'm worried.

458
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:37,119
lt's been five months, we still haven't
heard a word from Hank.

459
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:41,455
lt's like l told you, he just loves
to disappear for long periods of time.

460
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:45,361
Got the soul of a wanderer.
Just like his mother.

461
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:49,495
He's gonna be here
when that baby's born.

462
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:52,901
ln the meantime, l'll
get you whatever you need.

463
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,202
You positive
Hank'll come back?

464
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,640
l believe it
with all my heart.

465
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,236
And that's what
you got to do.

466
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,940
Okay? You gotta believe.

467
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:23,360
Prisoner number 00C966,
Jeremiah Cloutier;

468
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,097
Convicted
December 27th, 2000;

469
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,937
embezzlement
and petty larceny.

470
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:33,604
Sentence: nine years,
up for parole in five.

471
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,640
He's one of them
TV evangelists.

472
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:42,244
One of them? Until this scandal,
he was bigger than Falwell.

473
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:44,346
He cured
my sister of leprosy.

474
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:50,624
- Liar.
- Pneumonia?

475
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,590
Gentlemen.

476
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:58,059
- Mr. Schillinger?
- Yeah?

477
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:00,435
l bring you greetings
from Calvin Anderson.

478
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:03,805
- Oh you know Cal?
- Oh indeed, l do.

479
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:06,504
When you have some time,
l'd like to talk to you.

480
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:07,910
About what?

481
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:10,676
Life in general...

482
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:12,979
here in Oz.

483
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:18,549
My schedule's pretty clear.
How 'bout right now?

484
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:23,828
''Jack came down out of the bean stalk
as fast as he could,

485
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:27,457
and he ran and he ran until he got
to his mother's house.

486
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:31,026
Once there, he gave her
the golden harp

487
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:34,436
and all the other treasure he brought
back from the giant's castle.

488
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,838
And they lived
happily ever after.''

489
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:42,907
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
- Yeah, of course.

490
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:45,815
Good.

491
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,251
l want to ask you
another question, Vern.

492
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:51,118
l'd like you
to answer me honestly.

493
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:55,051
- Are you happy?
- Sure.

494
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,954
Honestly.

495
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:04,401
All your life, you thought that
your way was the right way,

496
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:07,633
the best way,
the only way.

497
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:10,903
And yet as a result,
your wife is dead,

498
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:14,901
one son dead,
the other missing,

499
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:19,042
and you are stuck
in this miserable hellhole.

500
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:23,348
How could any man be happy?

501
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:29,351
Let the joy of Jesus Christ
fill your heart.

502
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:33,262
Let him who suffered
take away your suffering.

503
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,789
Open up to the Lord.

504
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,699
Get your
fucking hand off me.

505
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,208
How's law school, Angus?

506
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:50,680
l'm in a constant state
of chasing my own ass.

507
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,013
- l remember that feeling.
- No.

508
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:55,645
l mean, not only do l have to become
the perfect lawyer,

509
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:57,552
l have to be
an ideal husband and father.

510
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,113
Because l fucked it all up.

511
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:00,624
Jesus, that's not
what l meant.

512
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,854
That's the way
Mother and Dad feel,

513
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:04,919
especially
since the kidnapping,

514
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:08,262
especially since l told them
l was fucking another man.

515
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:12,369
Toby, they're
old fashioned.

516
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,167
l mean, none of this
makes any sense to them.

517
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:17,333
What, do you think
it makes sense to me?

518
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,152
Well, let's play the game.

519
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,920
And the category
is literature.

520
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,553
And William Shakespeare
once referred to this act

521
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:41,156
as ''the beast
with two backs.'' John.

522
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,896
l'm not real confident when it comes to
Shakespeare, so l think l need a hint.

523
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:49,566
- Robert.
- Shakespeare, Shakespeare.

524
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:52,269
lsn't that the guy that made it
with Gwyneth Paltrow?

525
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:58,007
- The beast with two backs.
- Sex.

526
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,187
Oh, sex.
Sexual intercourse.

527
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:06,679
Beecher, is that your little brother
l saw you with in the visiting room?

528
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:09,193
- Sex is correct.
- He's cute. He fool around?

529
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:15,666
The last time l made it, my girlfriend
fell asleep in the middle.

530
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:22,365
Evil Marduk,
King of Babylon,

531
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:27,310
in the year that he became king
released Jehoiachin from prison.

532
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:31,076
And he spoke
kindly to him.

533
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:35,576
And Jehoiachin took off
his prison clothes,

534
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,215
and he took
his meals with the king

535
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:41,316
all the days of his life.

536
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,089
This is bullshit.

537
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:45,926
Who said that?

538
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:50,398
Come on, loudmouth.
Have the courage to face me.

539
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:55,636
l said it,
and it's true.

540
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,505
Step forward.

541
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:07,917
- What is your name, my friend?
- Jim Burns.

542
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,319
And why are you
in Oz, Jim Burns?

543
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:14,257
They say l murdered my brother,
but l'm innocent.

544
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:17,784
You see before you
a sinner.

545
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:21,356
You see before you
a man possessed by demons.

546
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,799
The demons of fear,
guilt and hate.

547
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,565
l say, demons, be gone.

548
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:29,698
l cast thee out in the name
of Jesus Christ the Savior.

549
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:32,801
Demons, be gone!
Leave this man.

550
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:35,677
Sink back into the eternal fires
of damnation.

551
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,510
ln the name of God,
l command it!

552
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,017
ln the name of God,
be gone.

553
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:50,925
Now you rise.
Rise up, Jim Burns.

554
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,190
You rise and praise the Lord.
Praise him.

555
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:00,268
Praise the Lord.

556
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:02,569
Praise the Lord!

557
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,111
''By mercy and truth,
inequity is purged.

558
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,852
And by the fear
of the Lord, men depart.''

559
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:25,621
- May l?
- Please.

560
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:37,506
l do want to be happy.

561
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:45,206
Come on,
what's the scam?

562
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,649
There is no scam.

563
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:49,118
You're serious about
going through with this?

564
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,314
lt's been months
since Beecher's kid died.

565
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:55,258
l kept thinking he was planning
something, some way to retaliate.

566
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,454
He hasn't done anything.

567
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:00,396
Yeah, but you and this prag
sitting together

568
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:03,400
in one of Sister Pete's
interaction sessions?

569
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:06,335
- That's crazy.
- Why?

570
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,669
l'm just sick
of all this horseshit.

571
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:11,869
l want to concentrate on the birth
of my first grandchild.

572
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,606
You know, l just want
a little taste of happiness.

573
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:17,911
Vern, you're starting
to scare me.

574
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:23,852
Tobias, l believe that
Schillinger is genuine

575
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,584
in wanting to put this ugliness
between you to rest.

576
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,615
l tried to do that by trying
to find his son Hank.

577
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,026
What did l get in return?

578
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,360
My son's dead,
my daughter's traumatized.

579
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:35,457
Yeah, but this time,
for the first time,

580
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,162
the need for reconciliation
is coming from Schillinger.

581
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:40,193
So what?

582
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:43,674
This could just be another one
of his plans, some sort of revenge.

583
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,410
You'll never
know if we don't try.

584
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:10,927
Prisoner number
01B784, Ronald Barlog;

585
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:14,803
Convicted January 1 2th, 2001 ;
car theft.

586
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:18,639
Sentence: 1 3 years,
up for parole in six.

587
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,907
This is your sponsor,
Tobias Beecher.

588
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:25,347
He's going to help you
acclimate to your new life.

589
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:28,284
- Beecher, this is Ronald Barlog.
- Ronnie.

590
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,946
- Hey.
- All right.

591
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:31,717
Let's go, Ronnie.

592
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:43,758
Holy shit. Holy fucking shit!
Keller, man!

593
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:46,531
Look at this motherfucker.
Hey, man, how are you doing?

594
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,368
- How you doing?
- Real good.

595
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:51,136
- How long has it been?
- Last time l left, you had Tommy F's.

596
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,541
You were screaming for Leila.
''l got to meet Leila at the pier.''

597
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:55,603
- Who were you screaming for?
- l'll tell you what.

598
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,478
Get yourself settled,
then we'll catch up.

599
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,312
- All right.
- All right, Cool. You winning?

600
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,250
No, l'm getting
my ass kicked.

601
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,318
He's cute.

602
00:39:05,356 --> 00:39:06,789
Does he like
to fool around?

603
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,595
So l guess
l'm on the bottom?

604
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,971
Unless you want
to be on top.

605
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,499
No, no, l'm good
with the bottom.

606
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,342
- You knew Keller on the outside?
- Oh, yeah.

607
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,150
Yeah, we were--
we were partners for a while.

608
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:41,324
You two ever fuck?

609
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,755
What?

610
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,358
- You need anything you ask, okay?
- Okay.

611
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:44,213
Prisoner number 01R289,
Burr Redding;

612
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:48,419
Convicted January 11th, 2001 ;
murder in the first degree,

613
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,689
seven counts
of attempted murder.

614
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:54,630
Sentence: life without
the possibility of parole.

615
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:06,843
Ever since Adebisi died, the homeboys
have been in complete disarray.

616
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:08,812
Redding is just the guy
to galvanize them.

617
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:10,575
And you would like me to--

618
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:12,583
l would like us both
to gain his confidence,

619
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,085
make him a partner
instead of a foe.

620
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,020
l'll do what l can.

621
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:23,587
Mr. Redding,
l'm Tim McManus.

622
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:25,061
This is Kareem Said.

623
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,290
Salam Alaikum.

624
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:31,298
You the cat that wasted
Simon Adebisi?

625
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,634
- Yes, l am.
- Outstanding.

626
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:38,436
l heard he was
one mean motherfucker,

627
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:42,108
which makes you even worse.

628
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:45,343
l guess l'm gonna
have to watch my step.

629
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:47,476
l killed Adebisi
in self-defense.

630
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:51,919
- The court exonerated me.
- No doubt.

631
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,059
But motives are
less important than outcome.

632
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,288
He's dead, and you're not.

633
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:02,766
- May l go now?
- No.

634
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,201
Burr, l think it's important that you
grasp how things work around here.

635
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:10,469
l grew up in the ghetto.
Pops died when l was 10.

636
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:15,070
l had to quit school, support my family
by doing some of everything,

637
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:17,342
from shining shoes
to shooting craps.

638
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,281
l went to Vietnam,
where they taught me

639
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:21,979
how to kill
small children and women.

640
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:26,149
l've been in all kind of penitentiaries
from Arizona to Alabama and back.

641
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,819
And l say all this
not out of pride or shame.

642
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,829
l just want to make sure
that you grasp

643
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:34,229
that l already grasped
how things work around here.

644
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:40,762
- May l go?
- Yes.

645
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:52,108
Yo!

646
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:56,446
Augustus.

647
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,885
Oh man, l'm glad
you're here, Burr.

648
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:03,223
Hmm.

649
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,229
You know, man,
l ain't glad you're here.

650
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,754
l got it.

651
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:10,631
- Yo, how's Delilah?
- Delilah died, man.

652
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,535
Ovaries went sour on her.

653
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,664
Oh man, l'm sorry
to hear that.

654
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,936
So lay this situation
out for me.

655
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,909
Who's the players
around here?

656
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:23,175
Which one of these brothers
needs some talkin' to?

657
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,011
Okay.

658
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:28,712
First off, there's
that dude, Poet.

659
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:38,860
They say since Adebisi died,
you've been running the homeboys.

660
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,693
That's right, man.
That's right.

661
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:44,132
They also say you
been doing a shit job.

662
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,568
Look, old man, let me
tell you something--

663
00:43:46,604 --> 00:43:50,096
You think ''old man''
bothers me?

664
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:52,336
Boy, l done had a whole lot
of men tougher than you,

665
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:54,674
you that called me worse
didn't make it to old.

666
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:59,445
My age is my honor
and my strength.

667
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:02,782
Shit, you think you can just come up
here and take control?

668
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,050
Some people are born leaders,
others are not.

669
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:08,820
A wise man knows
his own limitations.

670
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,952
You think on that.

671
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,071
We've got a nice
operation going.

672
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:28,511
- We don't need you fucking things up.
- Chucky, relax.

673
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:32,173
Now we'd value
your friendship.

674
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,946
We'd even be willing
to cut you a slice.

675
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:39,821
Be extremely generous.
l'll get back to you.

676
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,848
Back to us?

677
00:44:41,892 --> 00:44:45,555
You take the deal now
or there is no fucking deal.

678
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:50,431
Pancamo, Morales, l told you dinks
before this classroom is for classes

679
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:53,198
not your board of directors meetings.
Come on, let's go.

680
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:55,933
Let's go, move it!

681
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:59,500
What you waiting for, an engraved
invitation there, Redding? Come on!

682
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:10,843
Red, man, you know them motherfuckers
is plotting against you, right?

683
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,446
Good, that's what
l want them to do.

684
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,788
You want them to kill you?

685
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:17,191
l want them to try.

686
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,196
Last night
a Chinese freighter

687
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,668
ran aground off
the Jeb lsland Sound.

688
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:28,171
When the US Coast Guard
went to evacuate the crew,

689
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:32,107
they discovered 36 illegal aliens
stowed on board.

690
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:35,738
Until the State Department can determine
the legal status of the refugees,

691
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,112
the 18 men,
1 2 women, and six children

692
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:40,549
will be housed
in various state buildings,

693
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:43,144
including the Oswald
Correctional Facility.

694
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:48,021
Leo, this is insane.
The state's got 40 other prisons.

695
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,686
Put these men somewhere else.

696
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,752
l got a call from
the Secretary of State.

697
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:54,594
The Secretary of State asked for help.
l'm not inclined to argue.

698
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:57,294
What are you looking for an appointment
in the new administration?

699
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:59,234
- Don't be snarky.
- My question is,

700
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,966
where are we gonna house them? We're on
the brink of overcrowding as it is.

701
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:05,134
Since this is
a temporary situation,

702
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:07,872
l thought we might set up some cots
in the common room of Emerald City.

703
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:11,814
No way. l have only just re-established
some order in there.

704
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,476
You're not gonna
upset the apple cart.

705
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:15,849
This isn't a matter for discussion.
We have an emergency.

706
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:18,116
And everyone,
including you, will bend.

707
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:21,556
- You mean bend over.
- Tim...

708
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:24,823
l know from a practical side
that this is a pain,

709
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:27,524
but we cannot lose sight
of the humanitarian issue.

710
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:30,125
These men and their families
fled repression in China,

711
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:34,399
paying a sizable amount of money
to book passage on this boat.

712
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:37,874
From what l read in the papers, the
conditions were worse than slave ships.

713
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:40,934
They sailed for months,
they crashed, they got arrested.

714
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:43,674
They're separated from their wives
and their children.

715
00:46:43,714 --> 00:46:47,343
So if we must have them,
let's at least embrace them.

716
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:51,047
Warden, this is Gao Liu Xio
from the State Department.

717
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:53,488
- Ms. Gao, a pleasure.
- Thank you.

718
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:56,391
We have the men
in a bus outside.

719
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:59,521
Okay, let's get them
to Receiving and Discharge.

720
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:02,555
Hi, Tim McManus.
They'll be staying in my unit,

721
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,330
so anything l can do to make them
more comfortable,

722
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,202
- you just let me know.
- Excellent. Come with me.

723
00:47:14,912 --> 00:47:18,143
l'm not going to lie to you
and say that life will be easy.

724
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:24,977
The prisoners in Oz are amongst the most
violent criminals in the country.

725
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:32,326
But we have added extra correctional
officers to the unit,

726
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:34,661
and they've all been
instructed to watch over you.

727
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:41,261
Do any of them
speak English?

728
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:47,576
l-- l do.

729
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:49,670
Good, then l'm going
to be relying on you

730
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:54,150
- to help keep communication going.
- l'm at your service.

731
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:58,144
Thank you. All right, you all need
to follow Officer Armstrong.

732
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:07,796
This is America, Gongjin.
Speak English.

733
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:11,968
Never volunteer.

734
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:16,098
We are in danger of being
sent back to China.

735
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,009
l will do everything l can
to prove that l belong here.

736
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,647
These people
are our guests,

737
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:27,878
and l expect you to
treat them as such.

738
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:32,048
lf any harm comes to them,
the repercussions will be severe.

739
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:35,252
Now they're going
to be arriving shortly, all right?

740
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:37,783
Now until they get familiar
with their new surroundings,

741
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:39,728
we're going to put
the rest of you on lockdown.

742
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,492
Oh come on, what?

743
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:43,261
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
my heart's breaking.

744
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,791
Lockdown. Let's go.
Move it!

745
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:59,043
- So are you staying in town tonight?
- Yes.

746
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:01,749
Doing anything for dinner?

747
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,051
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- Oh no, no,

748
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,887
but we've both
got to eat.

749
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:10,018
There's a little diner
l know, very informal,

750
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,585
where we could grab a quick bite.
lt's nothing fancy.

751
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:29,072
Your grandfather is right.

752
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:32,039
These are bad men.

753
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:47,492
You got a problem
with the cuisine there, Hop Sing?

754
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:50,056
- No, no.
- Then move along.

755
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,727
You're holding up
my regular customers.

756
00:49:56,573 --> 00:50:00,475
l wonder how Wan Wa
and Jia Yu are doing.

757
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:02,638
Mai Shoo Ying is tough.

758
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,443
She look after Wan Wa.

759
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:08,076
But my son-- they put all
the children in the orphanage.

760
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:11,178
He's never been
apart from us before.

761
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:18,717
Hey, guys, this is
my table.

762
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:22,061
- You say what?
- This is my table.

763
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:24,567
Get your Chink asses up
and move. Chop, chop.

764
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:27,536
Oh, hey! No, no.
Stop! We're sorry.

765
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:32,198
Chuck, that's no way
to treat these poor fellows.

766
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:36,475
- You their leader?
- No.

767
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:39,573
- Well, they listen to you.
- Yes.

768
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:40,810
That makes you
their leader.

769
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,980
You come and see me.

770
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:45,682
We'll talk, okay?

771
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:49,992
- All right.
- Okay.

772
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,199
- Do not go.
- How can l not go?

773
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:11,010
He's a powerful man.
We may need his help.

774
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:14,313
l wish we had never
got on that boat.

775
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:17,081
l wish we were
in Tong Du right now.

776
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:21,888
Starving? You watch our crop
burn in the hot sun.

777
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,895
You watch your daughter die.
l cannot do that.

778
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:30,092
- lf they send us back--
- l will not go!

779
00:51:30,134 --> 00:51:32,967
l would rather die here
in America.

780
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:43,412
- Jiu shi.
- Jiu shi, what does that mean?

781
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:45,540
''Chairman'' like Mao.

782
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:49,518
l love that.
Jiu Shi Morales.

783
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:55,117
ln fact it would be
Morales Jiu Shi.

784
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:57,320
The family name
is always first.

785
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:00,023
See, now that's what's fucked up about
your side of the world.

786
00:52:00,063 --> 00:52:03,191
The names, the way you read,
the funny alphabet.

787
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:06,999
- You people do everything backwards.
- Or you people do.

788
00:52:07,037 --> 00:52:09,767
Right.

789
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:13,743
Mr. Bian, the reason l asked to see you
is because l want to warn you.

790
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:16,503
You see that man
over there?

791
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:23,143
- Yes.
- Burr Redding is your enemy.

792
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:26,054
He hates you
and all your friends.

793
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,923
Why? We have done
nothing to him.

794
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,451
He served in Vietnam.

795
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:34,657
We are Chinese.

796
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:36,359
He don't know
the difference.

797
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,960
All he sees is
your yellow skin.

798
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:42,438
And he has vowed to kill
each and every one of you.

799
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:48,768
l will go to him.
l will reason with him.

800
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:51,178
Does he look like
a reasonable man?

801
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:55,317
Then you must kill him.

802
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:57,946
Not you necessarily,
but one of your men.

803
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:02,481
We are simple folk--

804
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:04,494
farmer, factory worker.

805
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:09,124
We left China
to escape the killers,

806
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,690
not to become one.

807
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:13,532
Then from now on l will
call you ''Hombre Muerto.''

808
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,937
- What is that?
- Dead man.

809
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,975
One of the Chinese came to me telling me
that you threatened him.

810
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:28,246
What are you talking about?
l haven't said two words to any of them.

811
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:30,150
l've got a lot more reason
to believe him than you,

812
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:31,950
so l'm gonna
tell you something.

813
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:35,823
Anything happens at all,
l'll hold you personally responsible.

814
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,453
- That's bullshit.
- Regardless, that's the way it is.

815
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,759
You steer clear,
you understand?

816
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:48,504
That's wonderful.
Have you heard from Jia Yu?

817
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:52,134
Tell him that--
that l love him.

818
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:55,968
And, Wan Wa...

819
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,447
l love you, too.

820
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,714
Okay.

821
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:11,018
- How does she sound?
- She-- she miss me.

822
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:13,655
She says Shoo Ying
is bossing everyone around.

823
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,666
Thank you for
the phone call, Jiu Shi.

824
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:18,861
lt's the least l could do.

825
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:22,736
Work detail.

826
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:24,263
What-- what is that?

827
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:25,900
Oh, we all have
jobs to do.

828
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:29,503
Oh l-- l would like
to work.

829
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:31,036
- Yeah?
- You sure?

830
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,915
l would.
l want to do my part.

831
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:38,786
- Okay, let me go talk to some people.
- Okay.

832
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:55,662
What's going on, Ousi?

833
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:59,005
- lshu.
- lshu, sorry.

834
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:01,772
Not that l'll need to know how to
pronounce your name for much longer.

835
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:05,581
What is going on?

836
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:08,176
Well, you see, lshu, you've done
everything l've needed you to do,

837
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:09,947
and l'm grateful,

838
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:12,353
but there's just one last thing
l must ask of you.

839
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:15,051
What?
What's that?

840
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:18,052
Dying.

841
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:23,998
My wife, my son.

842
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:26,366
They will mourn you forever.

843
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,167
Help!

844
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:51,952
l warned you.

845
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:55,924
- What?
- Put him in the cage.

846
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:58,935
- What the fuck for?
- Come on, let's go.

847
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:01,369
- What the fuck's going on in here?
- Come on, move it!

848
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:04,602
Oh, you motherfucker.

849
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:06,199
Come on.

850
00:56:07,744 --> 00:56:10,474
Come on.
Get-- come on.

851
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:14,651
Get the fuck in there!

852
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:18,519
Open up the goddamn door!

853
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:19,544
Open it up!

854
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,393
No! No!

855
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:29,465
Any convert, whether he goes
from communist to capitalist

856
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:31,990
or from six packs a day
to smoke-free

857
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,196
ends up condemning
his former practices.

858
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:37,695
Because those beliefs didn't work
for him, they can't work for anybody.

859
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:41,199
His vision becomes narrow,
blinded by the light.

860
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:44,907
Whether he's transformed
into a Hindu or joins A.A.,

861
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:46,711
he becomes a fanatic.

862
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,982
lf you ask me, it's the fanatics
who fuck up the world.

863
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:54,286
lt's the fanatics who think
they've got God on their side.

864
00:56:54,324 --> 00:56:57,521
The rest of us?
We don't need divine light.

865
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:01,258
ln the dark of night,
all we want is enough light

866
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:04,426
so that we don't stub our toe
on the way to the toilet.
