1
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:37,517
l don't wanna fight nobody!

2
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:41,476
ln America we all have certain
inalienable rights,

3
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:46,532
like the right to bear arms
and the right to remain silent.

4
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,277
But the state has the ultimate right.

5
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:51,785
lt can kill us.

6
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:54,250
Due to popular demand,

7
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:57,087
Governor James Devlin revived
capital punishment.

8
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:01,045
And he decided
that Jefferson Keane,

9
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:04,632
a man he doesn't know,
a man he will never even meet,

10
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:06,422
should be put to death.

11
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:10,007
Should be put down
like a rabid dog.

12
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:13,344
The mood in this country
has changed.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,678
People are sick of crime,
sick of being afraid.

14
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:17,729
They need a sign
that something is being done.

15
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,569
Even, governor, if it's been proven
that executions have no effect

16
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,645
on the increase or decrease
in crime whatsoever?

17
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,317
Especially if it has no effect. These
days murders are random, senseless.

18
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,284
Maybe the punishment
should be too.

19
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:33,574
Jefferson Keane will be the first person
executed by this state in 34 years.

20
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,749
He's the first because he snapped
the neck of another inmate.

21
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,578
He's the first because
he deserves to die.

22
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:41,291
Jefferson Keane is the first
because he's black and he's young.

23
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:44,715
The public is not gonna feel safe
if we execute a 70-year-old white guy.

24
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:47,257
- You gonna turn this into a racial thing?
- Oh, please.

25
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:50,264
Anybody thought about all the protestors
we're gonna have outside,

26
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,347
marching around, yelling slogans?

27
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:54,474
And the counter-protestors
yelling at them?

28
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:57,479
Yeah, and we'll have
even less parking spaces.

29
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:03,853
The protestors aren't
gonna be a problem.

30
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,946
l want you to know
that when those protestors come,

31
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,396
l'm standing with them.

32
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:11,653
l can't have an employee of mine
out there at a vigil,

33
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,657
- holding a candle in front of a camera.
- The last time l looked,

34
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,501
we had freedom of speech and
freedom of assembly in this country.

35
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,834
- Or did you eliminate those rights too?
- The governor's been biting my ass,

36
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,831
saying he's gonna make
more budget cuts.

37
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,841
And he means it,
up to, and including, your job.

38
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,590
ls this a threat?

39
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:33,509
l've got a job, Leo.
l've got a permanent vocation.

40
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,925
l can go teach fifth-grade kids
at Cathedral School.

41
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,222
l can go be a missionary
in Pago Pago.

42
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:42,519
- Don't join the protestors.
- And if l do?

43
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,860
You're fired.

44
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,990
Well, that's fine.

45
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,797
l'll send you a postcard
from Pago Pago.

46
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,587
Hey, Markstrom, man,
what if Keane didn't kill Martinez, huh?

47
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,429
Look, what if they got
the wrong man?

48
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,425
- He did it, Kenny.
- Look, l know he did it.

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,059
l'm saying what if he didn't do it?

50
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,516
- l don't understand.
- All l'm saying, Nino, is,

51
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,348
makes you wonder
what the guy's doing,

52
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:24,607
what the guy's thinking, sitting
on death row knowing he's gonna die.

53
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,769
The only difference between
you and him, Joey,

54
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,187
is he knows the exact date he'll die.

55
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:32,691
So the state's gonna let Keane choose
which way he wants to go out.

56
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,320
Me, l'd take hanging.

57
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:37,241
- What about lethal injection?
- That's for pussies.

58
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:39,537
They say lethal injection
causes no pain.

59
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,125
How do they know?

60
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:44,786
Did someone come back from the dead
and say they didn't feel anything?

61
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:48,044
Did you hear?
Sister Peter Marie got fired.

62
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,125
Yeah, l know. l was her assistant.

63
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:53,256
She got fired because
she's against the death penalty.

64
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:55,132
- So am l.
- Me too.

65
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:58,100
Were you around when the last
person in the state was executed?

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,635
l was the last person
in this state executed.

67
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:43,186
So you're saying your life was saved
by the '65 blackout?

68
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,101
All the electricity in five states gone.

69
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:48,807
To this day they don't know
whether the shortage kept me alive

70
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:50,777
or if l caused the power to go:

71
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,069
- And you had no after-effects?
- Sure.

72
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,824
That's when l first met God.

73
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:59,735
He shook my hand, smiled
and said, ''Bob, play the oboe.''

74
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:01,365
- The oboe?
- The oboe.

75
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,075
- And do you?
- What?

76
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,035
- Play the oboe.
- No.

77
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:07,209
l don't have the lips for it.

78
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,260
Gonna share?

79
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:18,549
Hey, lawboy.

80
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:21,090
l thought Schillinger said
you couldn't get high anymore.

81
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:23,806
Yeah. Fuck him.

82
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,812
You go over my appeal?

83
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:30,435
Ryan, l told you,
l was in litigation, not criminal law.

84
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:32,184
l got no chance, huh?

85
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,276
Considering the number
of eyewitnesses?

86
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,192
- No.
- Yeah. Fuck it.

87
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,661
Least l'm not getting the juice
like that scumfuck Keane.

88
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,905
He should've just let
the Latinos take him out.

89
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,038
That's the reason
why they were there.

90
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,239
What do you mean?

91
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,247
The Latinos were in the gym
to kill Keane?

92
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,421
- Never mind.
- Are you saying he was set up?

93
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:55,332
- Never mind, Beecher.
- No, no, no, if it was self-defence,

94
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,669
- he shouldn't be executed.
- Fuck that.

95
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,924
Don't make trouble or you'll be next.

96
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,435
Excuse me.

97
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:12,895
l'd like to get a fax copy of the transcript
from the Jefferson Keane trial.

98
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,444
Beecher.

99
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:18,986
Get your ass over here.

100
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:30,336
- Yes, sir?
- My laundry's not gonna wash itself.

101
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:41,426
Sir, have you heard anything
about Jefferson Keane being set up?

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,050
Oh, yeah.

103
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,722
Yeah, the hacks
made him a gladiator.

104
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,142
Even got the whole thing
on videotape.

105
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51,060
- Wouldn't you love to see that?
- Yeah.

106
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:54,857
lf we can get ahold of that videotape,
he wouldn't be executed.

107
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,318
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,108
Another nigger's going down.

109
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,487
l'm glad.

110
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,452
- But--
- But, but what?

111
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:07,529
Nothing, sir.

112
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,956
Don't forget, a little starch.

113
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,922
So l'll go to McManus, tell him
what might have happened in the gym,

114
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,581
- get him to investigate.
- You can't.

115
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:20,553
- Why not?
- You say anything, they'll kill you.

116
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:23,467
- They who?
- Exactly.

117
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:26,599
Hey, Beecher.
Sorry l got a little testy before.

118
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,684
That's okay.

119
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,140
You wanna get high?

120
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,438
No, thanks, man. Not right now.
Kind of trying to keep my head clean.

121
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,902
Later.

122
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:43,941
What l should do is represent Keane
and appeal his murder conviction.

123
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:45,441
You?

124
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:48,331
- l'm a lawyer.
- The state disbarred you.

125
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,288
The state can't take away what l do,
who l am. l can help the man.

126
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,084
He killed Martinez in self-defence.
He shouldn't die.

127
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:00,710
You need to talk to Keane himself,
find out what really went on that day.

128
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:02,713
Yeah, l know,

129
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,507
but getting into death row isn't easy.

130
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,760
l have a way.

131
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,437
- l'm in fear for my life.
- From who?

132
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:14,727
l can't say.

133
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:18,191
You know l can't say. l need you
to put me in protective custody.

134
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,232
You can't be going in and out of
protective custody whenever you want.

135
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:23,025
lt's to be used
only in extreme cases.

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,773
- Well, this is.
- Next time you ask for protection,

137
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:28,526
- l may say no.
- l'll take that risk.

138
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,169
Keane?

139
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,893
Keane.

140
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:54,729
Keane.

141
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,891
- Who wants me?
- Beecher.

142
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,652
Tobias Beecher.

143
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:02,779
l need to talk to you about your trial.
l read your transcript.

144
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:04,608
You weren't cooperative
with your attorneys.

145
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:05,945
l killed Martinez.

146
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:08,276
Why didn't you tell the lawyers
that you were set up?

147
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,323
Look,

148
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,742
Johnny Post killed Dino Ortolani
because l told him to.

149
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,453
Now, the Wiseguys know that.

150
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:16,997
Now they want me dead.

151
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:20,332
lf they kill me,
one of my Homeboys gonna kill them.

152
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,458
And then they gonna kill
another one of my boys.

153
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:25,167
And on and on and on.

154
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:29,219
- My death can put an end to that.
- Not necessarily.

155
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,549
Look, if l die,

156
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,642
l feel like l might go to heaven now.

157
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,597
lf l go back to Em City,

158
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:37,356
l might go back to my old ways.

159
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:40,478
l may lose my faith, my soul.

160
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:43,729
l'm at peace right now, Beecher.

161
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:45,990
Please don't take that from me.

162
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,149
Look, l'm not responsible
for your soul,

163
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,406
but as a lawyer,
l am responsible for justice.

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,122
l don't need your cooperation
to file an appeal on your behalf.

165
00:10:58,295 --> 00:10:59,789
Beecher, please, don't.

166
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:01,499
lt's something l have to do.

167
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,502
We gotta get ahold of that tape.

168
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:07,505
lt's got the fight
between Keane and the Latinos.

169
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,010
What are the chances
of one of the hacks giving it up?

170
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:12,714
The video would implicate them
in the murder.

171
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,553
Yeah, well,

172
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:18,352
- do what you can, Bob.
- Sure.

173
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:22,141
There you are.

174
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,649
Oh, yeah, hey.

175
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:26,523
Why did you go into PC?

176
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,275
You know, l just needed
some time alone.

177
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,615
- What are you doing here?
- Working on Ryan O'Reily's appeal.

178
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,290
Really?

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,666
- Thought you said that was useless.
- Well...

180
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:42,334
Yeah, you know, but he asked me
to take another stab at it,

181
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:43,786
so l figured l would.

182
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:46,456
You wouldn't be bullshitting me,
would you?

183
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:49,837
You wanna take a break?

184
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:58,226
- You wouldn't be up to something else?
- No, sir.

185
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:06,523
''Argent v. the state of Texas--''
This is about a stay of execution.

186
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,819
Since when is O'Reily
being executed?

187
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,240
- Eat it.
- What?

188
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,083
- Eat the page.
- No.

189
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,623
Do not fuck with me, prag. Eat it.

190
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:29,842
Another one?

191
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:37,133
- Rebadow?
- Yes?

192
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:40,187
l understand you've been asking
questions about a certain videotape.

193
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,309
- Well...?
- Said videotape does not exist.

194
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:50,026
- Oh, really?
- You don't believe me?

195
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,734
No. Why should l?

196
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,620
Maybe a couple of days in the hole
will help clarify reality for you.

197
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,284
Heard you talked to Keane
even though l said don't.

198
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:04,493
Yeah.

199
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:06,504
That took some balls.

200
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:09,087
Starting to grow some balls,
Beecher?

201
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,087
l had balls...

202
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:16,843
...a long, long time ago.

203
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:21,349
And l thought l could get them
back again by saving Jefferson Keane.

204
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,559
But the lawyer in me...

205
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:32,991
...got stretched out on the rack
and hung by the neck until dead.

206
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:39,489
You got any dope?

207
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:42,578
What you need, pal, is an upgrade.

208
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:45,366
What you need is some heroin.

209
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:48,123
Go ahead.

210
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,503
You swat a fly, step on an ant,
squash a cockroach,

211
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,380
you don't think much of it.

212
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:59,262
ln fact, killing the bug gives you
a sense of accomplishment.

213
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:01,385
Fucking ant was ruining your picnic.

214
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:04,011
Cockroach was crawling
through your kitchen cabinet.

215
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:07,682
You put an end to their disgusting,
miserable little lives

216
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,852
and make a better world
for everyone.

217
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,154
Only for every one you kill,
more appear.

218
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:18,821
Bigger, uglier, meaner than before.

219
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,614
As a man of colour,
l am outraged by that verdict.

220
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,243
As a Muslim, l have to be concerned
with Tizi Ouzou's soul.

221
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,661
- Tizi Ouzou?
- Since the conversion,

222
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,590
that's the name that Jefferson Keane
chose for himself.

223
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,543
And so you wanna serve
as his minister?

224
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,877
As his imam, yes.

225
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,381
- You have any objection?
- No.

226
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:43,134
Okay, then. Here's the deal.

227
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:45,891
You can go see Keane in death row
and talk to him,

228
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,933
but only about spiritual matters.

229
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:51,810
lf l get wind of him or you,
or any of the brothers stirring up shit,

230
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,562
l will give him a rabbi.

231
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:18,177
As the day of execution draws near,
tension grows

232
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:22,047
both outside the walls at the Oswald
Maximum Security Penitentiary,

233
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:25,843
and inside, where the debate
on the death penalty is no less fierce.

234
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:29,811
l don't believe in murder. First degree,
abortion, or by jury decree.

235
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,189
- lt's all murder.
- Lethal injection?

236
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,276
What's wrong with
the good old electric chair?

237
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:37,239
Jefferson Keane will die tomorrow
in this prison.

238
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,118
ln light of the historic, moral
and political nature of the event,

239
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:42,443
we might lose sight
of the human factors involved.

240
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:45,497
We spoke today with
Cornelius Keane, the inmate's father,

241
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:47,954
and Helen Martinez,
mother of the murder victim.

242
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,540
You teach a boy right from wrong
and then you just hope,

243
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:52,290
you just hope for the best.

244
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,834
l want him dead.

245
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:58,458
l want him in the ground,

246
00:15:58,678 --> 00:15:59,710
dead.

247
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,881
Dead. Dead.

248
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,017
Jefferson Keane's sister's
in kidney failure.

249
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:10,894
- They think she'll die.
- Oh, this is just great.

250
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,184
Well, life just keeps getting
better and better.

251
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,404
l fucked this up from the get-ready.

252
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:20,983
Ortolani's dead because of me,
and now

253
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,443
Keane's gonna join him.

254
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:27,740
You think you're responsible
for that bad boy being on death row?

255
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:36,048
Timmy, and l mean this
in the nicest way possible,

256
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,499
you are one fucked-up guy.

257
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:41,716
Well...

258
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:46,090
...does that mean
we're not going to the play tonight?

259
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,468
Doctor. We need you.

260
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,321
We should run some tests.

261
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:08,038
Hey, some say
there are five stages of death.

262
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:15,544
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, and finally, acceptance.

263
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:18,547
The moment
when you say to yourself:

264
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:22,092
''l'm gonna die
and there ain't shit l can do about it.''

265
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:26,090
Oh, yeah,
in Oz we know all about that.

266
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,680
We know all about acceptance.

267
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,518
Look at your hair.

268
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,268
Come on, let me braid it for you.

269
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,598
Nah. lt's all right.

270
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:39,233
Come on, l'll make your hair
look so nice they won't wanna kill you.

271
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,861
- Come on, come on.
- You're crazy.

272
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:47,158
lf you really want to, chief.

273
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:55,910
- l saw Pop on TV yesterday.
- Yeah?

274
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,252
Talking about you,

275
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,754
talking about our family.

276
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,136
Sorry l ain't who you want me to be.

277
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,596
l like being queer.

278
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,180
l love you, Billie.

279
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:19,308
Allah loves you.

280
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,690
But Dad don't.

281
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:28,941
Jefferson. l'm sorry, Tizi.

282
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:31,202
l've got some bad news.

283
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:34,623
Your sister Grace is in the hospital.

284
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,495
Kidney failure.

285
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,333
The doctors think
that she'll probably die soon

286
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,582
unless she gets a transplant.

287
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,469
- But organs are scarce.
- Well, just take one of mine.

288
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,545
Not like l'm gonna use them
much longer.

289
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:50,096
- Make that happen, McManus.
- l'll try.

290
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:53,060
No, you do more than try.
Make it happen.

291
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:56,521
Make it happen!

292
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,890
You are sick people!

293
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:15,039
The governor says no.
He won't grant a stay.

294
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,705
Even that little prick Devlin
can't be that heartless.

295
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,246
Says Keane is too dangerous
to be released to a hospital.

296
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:23,457
He's changed.

297
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,046
This conversion of his
could be bullshit.

298
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:31,180
Talk to him, Leo. lt's real.

299
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:34,178
- We gotta fight for this one.
- How?

300
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:37,845
We go public, we stoke the protestors
and piss Devlin off even more.

301
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:41,149
- Devlin thinks he's God.
- Yeah.

302
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,482
Maybe it's time we got some help
from the real one.

303
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,984
You want me to call the cardinal
to intercede?

304
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,526
- Yes.
- Tim,

305
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,533
Cardinal Abgott
is more conservative

306
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:54,700
than Jesse Helms and Bill Buckley
all rolled into one.

307
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:57,584
He once gave a speech
where he justified the torture

308
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,162
of the Holy lnquisition.

309
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,785
That's fucked up.
Even so, you gotta make the call.

310
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,705
- You make the call.
- What, Ray? Are you afraid?

311
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,219
- No, of course l'm not.
- Then?

312
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:15,427
Why do you think
that l work here, huh, Tim?

313
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:18,763
l went to the Pontifical Gregorian
University in the Vatican.

314
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,599
l was in the top of my class.

315
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:23,858
l was the cardinal's
great yellow hope,

316
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,520
until l started working in his office and
l just asked a few too many questions.

317
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:30,533
l had a few too many opinions.

318
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,742
l defied him, instead of deifying him.

319
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,703
So His Excellency decided
to punish me by sending me to Oz,

320
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,330
to extinguish my career.

321
00:20:43,547 --> 00:20:45,420
So Jefferson Keane's sister dies

322
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,164
because you
and the cardinal had a tiff?

323
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:51,220
l didn't say l wouldn't make the call.
l'll make the call.

324
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,347
l'm just warning you,
it probably won't...

325
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,268
...do any good.

326
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:03,436
Sorry to disturb you.

327
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,353
You've come about the transplant.

328
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:11,407
Governor James Devlin,
under pressure from religious leaders

329
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:14,445
including Sheik Zahir Farar
and Francis Cardinal Abgott,

330
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,656
has granted a 30-day stay
of execution to Jefferson Keane,

331
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,073
the man convicted
of killing another inmate

332
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,041
at Oswald Maximum Security
Penitentiary.

333
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:24,957
Keane will donate a kidney
to an ailing sister.

334
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,627
He is expected to go into surgery
sometime today.

335
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,337
The governor was quick to point out
that all medical costs

336
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,669
are being covered
by the family's own insurance.

337
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,633
Clemency.
That's a fancy word for mercy.

338
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:38,518
You see, the governor can
commute a death sentence.

339
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:42,096
He has the power to just
pick up the phone and say no.

340
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:46,181
But to me, the only time
the governor shows clemency,

341
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,857
is when he don't make that call.

342
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,692
Because life in prison without parole

343
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:54,861
is a shitload worse than death.

344
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,868
Death is parole.

345
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,949
Death is the real mercy.

346
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:01,659
- King me.
- Oh, fuck.

347
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,369
- O'Reily.
- Yeah?

348
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:04,574
- Come here.
- Why?

349
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:05,951
- Because l say.
- So?

350
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,837
- We got business.
- Don't move any pieces.

351
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,666
- l got them memorized.
- Would l do that?

352
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,335
What do you think of me?

353
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:12,880
Hey, Joey. l'm here.

354
00:22:13,053 --> 00:22:14,962
- You bet Detroit in the game?
- Yeah.

355
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:16,336
- You lost.
- Fucking Thomas.

356
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:18,472
- You owe.
- l know. l'm good for it.

357
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:20,052
- Says you.
- Haven't l paid before?

358
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,258
- l want it now.
- Why?

359
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,263
- Because you owe.
- Why you busting my balls?

360
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:25,846
- l don't like your face.
- Hey, take a look in the mirror.

361
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:27,222
- You wanna die?
- Wanna try?

362
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,432
Problem, guys?

363
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,527
Yeah, the joint smells
of too much...garlic.

364
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:35,107
- What you want?
- D'Angelo, count to ten and walk away.

365
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:38,077
Fucking dago jizzbag.

366
00:22:41,832 --> 00:22:46,244
- You lose, white boy.
- No, l never lose when it counts.

367
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:50,001
l'm telling you, Jefferson was set up.

368
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,793
- By who?
- Come on,

369
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,505
you don't have to be John Thompson
to figure out the game plan.

370
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:56,754
You know it was the Wiseguys
that did it.

371
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:59,095
Schibetta sent Jefferson
to the gladiator ring?

372
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,551
No, not Schibetta.
l been asking around.

373
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,260
Looks like Joey D'Angelo
was roguing.

374
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,185
Ever since Ortolani croaked,
D'Angelo's been wanting to move up,

375
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:10,018
but the old man has been slow.

376
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,477
So D'Angelo took it on himself
to off Jefferson

377
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:13,982
just to impress the old man.

378
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:15,816
That fucking mook, D'Angelo?

379
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:18,072
lf D'Angelo got Jefferson
the death penalty,

380
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:20,948
we gotta execute that mother--

381
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,787
Look, you fellas do
what you gotta do,

382
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,632
but with all this shit
that's been going on around here,

383
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:36,921
if you whack D'Angelo,
Glynn's gonna lock us down for good.

384
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:40,630
- So, what are we supposed to do?
- You two work in the kitchen, right?

385
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:43,422
D'Angelo works in the kitchen.

386
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,969
- Maybe he has a little accident.
- Yeah.

387
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:48,103
- l like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

388
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:51,933
Now, why are you so hot on
justice for Jefferson, huh, white boy?

389
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:56,153
Because Jefferson took care
of Ortolani for me. l owe him.

390
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,072
Good morning.

391
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,655
- l'm Colin Auerbach,
- Who?

392
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:06,747
and, as you know,
Sister Peter Marie is not around,

393
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,123
so the warden asked me to pitch in.

394
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:13,333
- We want Sister Pete.
- She's not here.

395
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:17,213
- Today, we're gonna be--
- Shut the fuck up!

396
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:18,916
Thank you.

397
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:22,553
Today we're gonna talk about
anger management.

398
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:25,720
Controlling the savage beast
inside you.

399
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,349
You fuck.

400
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:42,076
Mr. Schibetta?

401
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,529
Can l come in?

402
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,332
l heard what happened to Joey.

403
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:53,207
Steam pipe bursts, knocks him
backward, hits him in the head.

404
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,962
- ls he okay?
- He's unconscious.

405
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,591
He'll be laid up for a while.

406
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,045
l don't mean to be reaching,
but if you ever need an extra hand...

407
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:05,257
l mean, come on, l took care
of Jefferson Keane for you.

408
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:08,227
He's gonna die
and both our hands are clean.

409
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:15,355
One of my best buddies
in the Army was Donnie O'Reily.

410
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,686
lrish guy.

411
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,405
From Howard Beach.

412
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:22,105
Tough little fucker,
didn't take any bullshit from anybody,

413
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,442
including the sergeant.

414
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:28,281
He loved women. He loved boats.

415
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:31,203
He loved women on boats.

416
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:33,126
He loved vodka.

417
00:25:33,336 --> 00:25:37,120
He loved women
who drank vodka on boats.

418
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,712
Who knows,

419
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:45,303
maybe we can do some business.

420
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,930
Great.

421
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:06,699
Poor son of a bitch.

422
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,082
- Yo, Padre.
- How you doing?

423
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:15,493
How's my baby?

424
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,670
He's not doing so good, Miguel.

425
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:22,500
- He's not getting any better.
- Shit.

426
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:26,919
The doctors, they're thinking
of taking him off the life support.

427
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,421
What you mean? Pull the plug?

428
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:33,354
- No. No. No. No.
- Maritza thinks it's the best thing too.

429
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:37,063
No, Maritza's sweet, she gonna listen
to anything anybody tells her to.

430
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:41,018
- l don't want them to kill my baby.
- They're not killing the baby, Miguel.

431
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,485
The machines are keeping
the baby alive. lf they turn them off,

432
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:46,068
the baby can have a natural death.

433
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:48,954
l wanna speak to Maritza.
l wanna see my baby right now.

434
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,078
You can't see Maritza,
you can't see the baby.

435
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:53,655
They're not even gonna
let you make a phone call.

436
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,034
They're gonna start
a psychiatric evaluation of you.

437
00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:59,036
- What, they don't think l'm a bug?
- You cut yourself all up.

438
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:01,456
So? l did it for the baby.

439
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,756
What do you mean
you did it for the baby?

440
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:07,302
You tell me l gave the baby life,
right, that he's my responsibility.

441
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:09,963
Well, the baby being sick,
you know, l don't know what to do.

442
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:11,512
l ain't a fucking doctor.

443
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:13,845
And slashing your face
did what, huh?

444
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:16,062
That's between me and God.

445
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:18,476
Oh, Miguel, you tell the shrink that

446
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,808
and you're gonna be in here
till you're 90 years old.

447
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:25,155
You gotta help me.
You gotta get me out of here.

448
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:30,360
You gotta help me see my baby.
You gotta tell them not to kill it.

449
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,034
You gotta-- You gotta let me
see my baby.

450
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,205
You gotta tell them not to kill it.

451
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,041
l wanna see my baby!

452
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:40,502
You see, l got Alvarez
on the road to redemption.

453
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:42,706
l got him to start caring.

454
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:45,166
And l guess
that's tearing him up inside.

455
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:49,169
The doctor at the neonatal unit,
he says that keeping the baby alive

456
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:52,017
- is actually cruel at this point.
- l'm trying to catch up here.

457
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:56,264
l've had one meeting with Alvarez,
he sort of just whined about his kid.

458
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,646
See, all l want is l just want a release
so l can take him to the hospital

459
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:02,568
because l think that when he sees
the condition the baby is in,

460
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:05,690
he will understand why they're
gonna take the life support away.

461
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:08,022
- l need more time.
- We don't have time.

462
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,943
They wanna turn
the machines off tomorrow.

463
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,034
Tomorrow? Forget it.

464
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:16,706
Okay. l don't need
his permission, you know.

465
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,369
You're gonna take
this responsibility on yourself?

466
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:23,794
Absolutely.

467
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:49,173
l appreciate everything
you've done for me,

468
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:54,009
especially, like, you know,
with the baby and all.

469
00:29:56,183 --> 00:30:00,643
l mean, l guess sometimes that's
the way things go, you know.

470
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:04,608
Things just work out like that.

471
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:08,107
You're right.

472
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:10,944
l feel better about myself.

473
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:19,409
l mean, l never thought
that l'd love a baby with all my heart.

474
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:26,415
And, you know, l never loved
anything before in my life.

475
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,877
lt's like it opened up
a whole new me.

476
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,171
That's important, right?

477
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,644
Figuring out who you are,
you know, and about yourself?

478
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:47,315
So, you know, l know now.

479
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:51,101
Well, l'm real glad.

480
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:55,822
Well, l owe it all to you.

481
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,454
Well, l gotta go.

482
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,239
Hey, Father.

483
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,537
Where was God
when my son died?

484
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:14,882
Same place he was
when his own son died.

485
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:29,189
- Well, it's looking pretty good.
- l feel good.

486
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:32,147
Well, the remaining kidney's
functioning fine.

487
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,696
The rest of you is pretty healthy.

488
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,152
So this afternoon
l'll have you transferred back to--

489
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:39,159
Death row. You can say it, doctor.

490
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:42,820
Keane, you have a visitor.

491
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:49,826
Hey, Pop.

492
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:00,761
How's Grace?

493
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:06,349
Doctor says she recuperating
faster than expected.

494
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:10,098
That's some rocking kidney
you gave her.

495
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:13,020
So how you doing?

496
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:17,982
l'm still a little turned around
by all this publicity, you know.

497
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,441
Having a microphone
shoved in my face

498
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,362
every time l leave the house.

499
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:26,369
We've been getting lots
of letters and cards, mostly nice.

500
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,623
One guy from lowa,
he sent $1 00 cash.

501
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:33,672
Your Aunt Tillie said
that l had to send it back.

502
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:37,381
- Did you?
- No fucking way.

503
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,098
Dad...

504
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:47,144
...l need you
to do something for me.

505
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:50,053
Anything, son.
Come on, now, you know that.

506
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,147
l need for you to talk to Billie.

507
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:59,570
- He's turned into a fag.
- You don't know what it's like in here.

508
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:03,911
You don't know the things
they do to you, the loneliness.

509
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,158
Talk to him.

510
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:10,244
l raised you three all alone.

511
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:16,205
And your sister, she's gonna
make something with her life,

512
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,672
especially with
what you've done for her.

513
00:33:18,885 --> 00:33:21,008
But when he leaves,

514
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:24,214
what's Billie ever gonna be?

515
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:28,264
Your son. My brother. Forever.

516
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,221
Okay, time's up.

517
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:44,908
lt's rare when you say
goodbye to someone

518
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:47,486
that you know it's the last time.

519
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:51,576
You can try to say whatever it is
you should have said before

520
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:55,209
or you can just hold on tight.

521
00:33:56,298 --> 00:34:00,841
Just hold on, hoping the moment
will last you a lifetime.

522
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:11,059
You all right?

523
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:20,397
Jefferson was my oldest.

524
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,693
So he always had a special place.

525
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:28,786
A man...

526
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:33,751
...shouldn't live
to see his own son die.

527
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:53,768
Hey, l brought you some tea.

528
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,768
You brought me some tea? Why?

529
00:34:56,983 --> 00:35:00,187
Well, it's herbal.

530
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:03,687
- Maybe you don't want it.
- Hey,

531
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:07,570
just so happens l'm out. Thanks.

532
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,613
- So.
- So.

533
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:17,875
Why you here, McManus?

534
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:19,286
l mean, what do you want?

535
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:21,415
l don't know.

536
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,585
l just...

537
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:27,090
l just wanted to tell you...

538
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,512
...that l'm sorry you're gonna die.

539
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,673
And...

540
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:33,844
You'd like my forgiveness?

541
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,137
Well,

542
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:40,311
whatever you think you've done,
l forgive you.

543
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:51,946
Did you get
Kareem Said's test results?

544
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:54,539
That feels so good.

545
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:58,664
So far, everything's fine.
l'm just waiting for the MRl results.

546
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,664
Well, good. You want to go
to dinner tonight?

547
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,330
- l can't.
- Why not?

548
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,964
l'm witnessing Keane's execution.

549
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:14,216
- What?
- Yeah, l told you.

550
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:17,680
- What? You didn't tell me. Oh, man...
- Yes, l did.

551
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:22,399
You didn't tell me. Gloria, this is not
something l would forget, believe me.

552
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:25,647
- Christ!
- Look, what is the big deal?

553
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,402
l'm only prescribing the drugs,
declaring the death.

554
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:31,031
- lt's not like l'm sticking the lV in.
- Gloria. Gloria.

555
00:36:31,203 --> 00:36:33,195
Gloria, doctors are
supposed to be healers.

556
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:34,914
You're supposed
to keep people alive.

557
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,201
- You're not supposed to kill them.
- You really see this as a killing?

558
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,036
l don't want you doing this.

559
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:42,875
- You what?
- l don't want you doing this.

560
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:45,040
Look, we've only been going out
a couple of weeks.

561
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:47,458
Where do you get off telling me
what l can and can't do?

562
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:49,545
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hey.

563
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,886
Don't grab me.

564
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:03,025
You better take some time off, Tim.

565
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,645
You been around this prison so much,
you're starting to act like them.

566
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:25,755
Thanks.

567
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,512
ls the governor here yet?

568
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,512
No, l haven't seen him.

569
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:39,557
But a pro-death-penalty marcher
just took a swing at Sister Pete.

570
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:40,761
ls she okay?

571
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:42,804
Good aim.

572
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,558
She just kicked him in the balls.

573
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:51,774
l take it you're not gonna
watch the execution?

574
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,398
How about you?

575
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:55,817
No.

576
00:37:56,037 --> 00:38:00,664
Can't stand watching flowers die,
let alone another human being.

577
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,786
Closest l ever came was Bambi.

578
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:06,418
- Bambi?
- Yeah.

579
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,592
My ex was a big hunter.

580
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,461
He was always going off
with his buddies,

581
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:14,174
so l said to him one time,
''Take me.''

582
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,927
After some complaining, he did.

583
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:20,178
So l got out there
in the forest with this

584
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:24,938
big hunky shotgun
and l fired at a deer.

585
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,399
Hit it dead-on.

586
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:33,322
So l went over to this thing
and l leaned down,

587
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:37,360
and this deer looked up at me
with these eyes...

588
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,450
...these eyes like flashlights.

589
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:46,953
l knelt beside it and l held its head
and l whispered, ''l'm sorry.''

590
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:53,213
Then, like batteries going bad,
the light in his eyes

591
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:59,301
flickered a little bit and went out.

592
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:03,639
For the next two years
we were married,

593
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:06,814
every time l walked into the den
l had to stare at that deer's dead eyes.

594
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,019
l had to dust them.

595
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:15,731
When we got divorced,
that's all l asked for, the deer's head.

596
00:39:16,618 --> 00:39:18,575
Then l buried it.

597
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:25,156
That's how l feel tonight.

598
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,252
What do you mean?

599
00:39:27,796 --> 00:39:31,331
Like my head's hanging on
somebody's wall.

600
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:40,807
- Wanna have dinner?
- Sure.

601
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:42,560
Hey.

602
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:44,139
Yeah?

603
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:48,019
- How you doing?
- Okay. You?

604
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:51,145
Not bad, for a man about to die.

605
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:53,603
Yeah, you go tonight, huh?

606
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:56,064
Yeah. You?

607
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:58,275
Next Thursday.

608
00:39:58,493 --> 00:39:59,656
But l'm on appeal.

609
00:40:00,245 --> 00:40:03,199
Did you ever see that old movie
with that old actress,

610
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:05,946
what's-her-name... Susan Hayward?

611
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:07,247
Which movie?

612
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:10,627
l don't know what it's called.
She's Gotta Live or something like that.

613
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:14,131
She's on death row,
waiting to be fried or gassed

614
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:16,174
or whatever they used to do
back in the day.

615
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:19,844
The only thing, her attorney
has applied for some reprieve,

616
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:21,634
so she just waits.

617
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,717
The clock keeps ticking.
Waiting for that call from the governor.

618
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:29,887
Yeah, and at the last
possible minute he calls, huh?

619
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:33,976
Well, you know, now that
l think about it, l think she fries.

620
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:42,490
l need to ask some questions.

621
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:50,117
What do you want done
with your property?

622
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:53,036
Give it to my dad.

623
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:55,712
And the money in your
trust account?

624
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:58,298
To my brother and sister.

625
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:01,752
Will your family
be claiming your body?

626
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:06,393
Yeah.

627
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:08,562
Who are your witnesses?

628
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:13,189
My dad and the Minister Said.

629
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:20,402
You sure you should see this?

630
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:22,826
Yeah.

631
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:27,412
Tizi and l have come
on a long journey together.

632
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,326
l'm not gonna turn
my back on him now.

633
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:37,545
Okay. Let's do it. Officer?

634
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:49,140
Death is the supreme moment
of truth, my brother,

635
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:52,352
so sayeth the prophet.

636
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:56,480
- Praise be unto him.
- And peace be unto you.

637
00:41:56,695 --> 00:42:01,155
Minister, they took my kufi.
l don't wanna die without my kufi.

638
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:03,240
You take mine.

639
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:14,542
Over 3,000 men and women
are sitting on death row right now.

640
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:19,964
Congress has denied state inmates
access to federal courts.

641
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:23,920
Congress has also eliminated
financing to law officers

642
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:25,591
for death row appeals.

643
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:30,430
The states themselves
are shortening the appeals process.

644
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,830
ln this country, there's now
one execution every single week.

645
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:43,127
There were more executions this year
than any time since the '50s.

646
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:46,711
And we all know how righteous
the '50s were.

647
00:43:52,227 --> 00:43:54,433
You can make
any statements you'd like.

648
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:03,436
l want my family to know

649
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,531
that l love them.

650
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:09,816
And l believe that this punishes them
more than it punishes me.

651
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:15,370
l'm so sorry
for the three murders that l did...

652
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:19,452
...and l wish by killing me today,

653
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:21,829
you could bring them back.

654
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:23,537
My time on this Earth...

655
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:26,417
...has been far too short.

656
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,966
Maybe too short
to get it all done right.

657
00:44:31,183 --> 00:44:32,641
So...

658
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,726
...l'm ready to move on.

659
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:41,682
All praise to Allah.

660
00:44:42,736 --> 00:44:44,775
All praise.

661
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:59,494
- Governor!
- Justice has been served.

662
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,502
L'ltalien, the Supreme Court
refused to hear your appeal.

663
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,128
Rehnquist is a fag.

664
00:45:11,348 --> 00:45:14,966
Be that as it may, your execution
is scheduled for tomorrow.

665
00:45:15,894 --> 00:45:19,974
Prisoner number 9 7L64 1,
Richard L'ltalien.

666
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:22,188
Convicted April 3, '9 7.

667
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,681
Murder in the first degree.

668
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,108
Sentence: Death.

669
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:27,987
Tomorrow?

670
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,914
Well, my schedule's clear. Okay.

671
00:45:37,874 --> 00:45:41,077
Hey, warden,
there's something l wanna tell you.

672
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:44,333
Something l never told anybody.

673
00:45:48,844 --> 00:45:50,670
l suffocated Jennifer Miller.

674
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:52,633
Yeah, l know.

675
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:55,631
That's why you're gonna die.

676
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:59,346
l also suffocated Dorothy Paine.

677
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:02,605
- Who?
- Dorothy Paine.

678
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:06,101
She was a waitress
up in Council Bluffs, lowa.

679
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:09,859
You confessing another murder?

680
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:15,578
l'll notify the proper authorities.

681
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:17,365
Wait!

682
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:22,823
l also suffocated Ethel Peterson
and Gertrude Victor.

683
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:26,627
And Mary Rapp.

684
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:30,956
And Christina Trudell
and Eleanor Hughes,

685
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:36,801
Linda Lomaz, Lisa Masters,
and Lorraine McCarthy

686
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:42,473
and Betty Case and lrene Martin
and Amelia Nugent,

687
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:48,644
Elizabeth Phelps and Lucille Upton
and Esther Vaughan.

688
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:50,647
Well, l did.

689
00:46:50,864 --> 00:46:55,609
Richard L'ltalien confessed
to 39 murders, all young women.

690
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:57,577
He suffocated them all.

691
00:46:57,787 --> 00:47:02,746
lf the governor had his way,
he would execute L'ltalien 39 times.

692
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:05,499
l have to get over there.

693
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:09,004
Ray, listen.

694
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:11,007
How can you go along with this?

695
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:14,007
You're as much against
the death penalty as l am.

696
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,670
Of course l am, Pete. l don't know.

697
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,473
Maybe if anyone deserves to die,
Richard L'ltalien deserves to die.

698
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:23,598
Maybe the world will breathe
a little easier once he's gone.

699
00:47:24,147 --> 00:47:26,270
My job is not to make judgments.

700
00:47:26,483 --> 00:47:29,686
My job is to be by his side.

701
00:47:29,903 --> 00:47:33,901
My place is with him...

702
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:37,525
...if he needs me.

703
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:43,538
Pray for him, Mary.

704
00:47:46,419 --> 00:47:48,329
That's for him.

705
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:52,171
That's for all of them.

706
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:04,680
Have you ever had
bull's balls, Father?

707
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:06,770
No, sir, l can't say that l have.

708
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:11,062
Well, they serve them every year
at the Bohemian Grove.

709
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,148
What's that? That's a restaurant?

710
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:17,230
Oh, man, you never heard
of the Bohemian Grove?

711
00:48:17,534 --> 00:48:21,033
lt's a retreat in San Francisco,
you know.

712
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:27,035
For investment brokers,
bankers, politicians, intellectuals.

713
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:29,375
l'm amazed you're not hip to it.

714
00:48:29,588 --> 00:48:33,751
Of course, l grew up in the Bay Area,
so we knew when it was happening.

715
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:37,552
Even as a kid l always
wanted to go, you know.

716
00:48:39,556 --> 00:48:41,632
Wouldn't that be something?

717
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:45,468
Swim in the Russian River
with some secretary of state,

718
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:48,771
piss on a redwood
next to Donald Trump.

719
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:54,612
l mean, these guys are the elite,
men of power.

720
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:56,150
Men.

721
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:02,943
Women were excluded,

722
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:05,369
but the Supreme fucking Court

723
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:08,155
forced the Bohemian
to let the coozes in.

724
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:09,959
Can you believe that shit?

725
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:13,254
Once they were in,
l wanted nothing to do with it.

726
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:14,710
l was done.

727
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:16,668
But who knows the women
you would have met?

728
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:19,257
Not the kind l'm gonna wanna fuck.

729
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:22,385
There's a big difference between
wanting to fuck a woman

730
00:49:22,557 --> 00:49:23,636
and wanting to kill her.

731
00:49:24,142 --> 00:49:25,802
ls there?

732
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:30,349
Have you ever been laid, Father?

733
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,391
No.

734
00:49:34,945 --> 00:49:37,649
Then what would you know
about pussy?

735
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:41,399
And what would you know
about anything?

736
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,368
All l know is that,
once upon a time,

737
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:47,704
you wanted to walk in the woods
with important people,

738
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,241
and now, instead...

739
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:52,165
...you're here.

740
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:56,079
l'm here because l love women.

741
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:59,503
l love every woman l see.

742
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:02,471
Tall ones, thin ones, fatties.

743
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,139
lt's true.

744
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,552
You know, l once worked
at a circus one summer,

745
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:10,770
and l fucked the dwarf
while the fat lady watched us.

746
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,725
l fucked trailer-park trash
in West Virginia,

747
00:50:15,944 --> 00:50:18,861
l fucked rich girls up the ass
in Aspen,

748
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:23,324
l fucked Ph.D.s, retards...

749
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:27,368
You know, once l fucked an amputee
with both legs missing.

750
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:30,957
Fucking them isn't
the same as loving them.

751
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:35,376
You sound just like a shrink
l had once in juvie.

752
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:39,548
She tried to tell me
that l hated women.

753
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:42,877
l showed her.

754
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:45,633
You fucked her?

755
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:47,557
And her daughter.

756
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:50,223
Then l snuffed them both.

757
00:50:52,355 --> 00:50:55,143
lf you love women so much,

758
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:56,931
why do you kill them?

759
00:50:57,152 --> 00:51:03,866
Because when you love someone,
they own you, they possess you.

760
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:06,945
l will not be possessed.

761
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:15,121
l'm here to give you
absolution for your sins.

762
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:19,002
- Do you wish to be absolved?
- Fuck, yes.

763
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:24,881
Shit.

764
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:30,391
You know, they told me l could order
anything l wanted as my last meal.

765
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:34,433
l should have ordered bull's balls.

766
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:41,733
l'm really not ready for this.

767
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:44,023
Oh, man.

768
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:47,741
First, the inmate's given
sodium pentothal,

769
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:51,119
the same anaesthetic used
in hospitals for major surgery.

770
00:51:51,331 --> 00:51:54,166
Then, a massive dose
of pancuronium bromide

771
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,533
that paralyzes the diaphragm.

772
00:51:57,754 --> 00:52:02,048
Then potassium chloride
to stop the heart.

773
00:52:11,017 --> 00:52:12,927
Don't try this at home, kids.

774
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:16,265
He's finished.

775
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:25,280
Hello.

776
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,317
Hello.

777
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:37,577
Christ was executed, you know.

778
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:39,876
And if he hadn't been,

779
00:52:40,088 --> 00:52:44,038
the world would be
a very different place.

780
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:46,299
A better place?

781
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:50,260
l didn't say that.

782
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:58,557
l want my job back.

783
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:01,688
- Okay.
- l don't have to beg?

784
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,478
lf it'll make you feel better, beg.

785
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:07,401
l want you to know l still
disagree with you on the death penalty.

786
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:10,481
Even for a cyst like L'ltalien?

787
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:14,782
Leo, thou shalt not kill.
The Bible makes that pretty clear.

788
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:18,041
You cannot take a human life
for any reason.

789
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,994
Yeah, but the Bible also says,
''an eye for an eye.''

790
00:53:22,214 --> 00:53:26,258
Which says to me
that if you kill, you die.

791
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:30,051
Seems to me God's talking
out of both sides of his mouth.

792
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:34,515
Maybe he's just as confused about
the death penalty as the rest of us.

793
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:38,973
All l know for sure is,
no one's gonna claim L'ltalien's body,

794
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:41,680
so we're gonna stick him
in a cheap pine box,

795
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,605
stamp an lD number on the lid,

796
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:48,029
and throw him in a hole
at Potter's Field.

797
00:53:48,448 --> 00:53:50,441
There he'll be...

798
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:53,154
...with no one to grieve for him.

799
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:55,786
l grieve for him.

800
00:53:56,456 --> 00:53:59,327
Yeah, l know. That's why l love you.

801
00:53:59,543 --> 00:54:01,915
That's why l'm glad you're back.

802
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:16,975
There's this brother
on death row somewheres,

803
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:20,057
he checked in when he was 1 6.

804
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:23,273
He sat there another 1 6 years

805
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:26,857
while the courts and lawyers argued
about this and that.

806
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:30,150
While he waited,
he painted a mural on his wall.

807
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:33,734
For all those years he painted,
not letting a soul see what he was up to.

808
00:54:33,952 --> 00:54:37,487
Finally, when he was 32
and had spent more life on death row

809
00:54:37,664 --> 00:54:42,160
than in his mama's house,
all his appeals were exhausted.

810
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:44,120
He was about to die.

811
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:46,710
As he was about to be let out
for the final time,

812
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:50,257
he finally unveiled his masterpiece.

813
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:52,011
All there was were six words.

814
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:57,555
''Death is certain, life is not.''

815
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:01,597
The next day the hacks
painted over it.

816
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,725
Peace out.
