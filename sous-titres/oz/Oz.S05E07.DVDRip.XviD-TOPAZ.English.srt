1
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,922
"The road to hell is paved
with good intentions."

2
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,457
Now there's a mind fuck
if I ever heard one.

3
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,029
"The good side of my will
is the road to damnation."

4
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,233
Fuck! Why even try
being good?

5
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,402
And if good intentions
take you to the lake of fire,

6
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,969
where do bad
intentions lead?

7
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,004
Oz.

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,348
Nino, please, you don't understand.
I didn't mean it.

9
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,945
- I did the best I could.
- Hey, doc. Dr. Nathan.

10
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,214
Can't you shut him up?
He blabbed all night. I couldn't sleep.

11
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,457
You're well enough to be discharged.
Transfer Shupe back to Em City

12
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,796
and give Pancamo five milligrams
of Haldol twice a day.

13
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,028
- Hey, Gloria.
- Hey.

14
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,629
- Chucky Pancamo's delirious.
- So what else is new?

15
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,469
- That's not funny, Tim.
- The paperwork said Augustus Hill

16
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,908
was being transferred here today.
I don't see him.

17
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,207
He's still in bad shape.
I put him in a private room.

18
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,736
Okay. Thanks.

19
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,580
- How you feeling?
- Like shit.

20
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,679
You came pretty close to killing
yourself. You want to tell me why?

21
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,690
I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

22
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,284
You had massive amounts
of heroin in your system,

23
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,886
which made you get a little sloppy
with your catheter,

24
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,295
which resulted
in renal failure.

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,300
You may not have been trying
to consciously kill yourself,

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,668
- but the result was the same.
- My moms died,

27
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,299
wife deserted me.

28
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,004
All of a sudden the walls in Oz
got too high and too thick.

29
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,572
Augustus, who gave
you the drugs?

30
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,846
- It don't matter.
- It does to me.

31
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,945
Look, what I did, I did.
Ain't nobody else gonna suffer.

32
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,424
Salvatore Desantos
is brain-dead from a drug overdose.

33
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,825
I suspect Burr Redding
is responsible.

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,422
I suspect he thinks
Desanto sold you the drugs.

35
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,661
- He didn't.
- All the more reason to tell me.

36
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,362
- I want to talk to Burr.
- No.

37
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:28,033
- McManus, please.
- No.

38
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:33,171
You got a message for Burr Redding,
I'm your AT&T.

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,977
Salvatore Desanto
didn't sell Augustus the drugs.

40
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,950
What?
Then who did?

41
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,681
- Well, he wouldn't tell me.
- He'll tell me.

42
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,246
Why, so you can feed
that guy LSD?

43
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,520
See, I don't have any proof,
but I got a feeling

44
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,356
you're the one
that fucked Desanto up,

45
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,192
and I won't give you an opportunity
to fuck someone else up.

46
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,223
Officer, escort
this gentleman out.

47
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,703
- Where's Busmalis?
- Why?

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,934
What's up?
What's up?

49
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,309
- You said Desanto sold those drugs.
- Yes.

50
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,611
- You lied.
- No.

51
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,847
- Why'd you lie, Busmalis?
- Well, l...

52
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:18,050
- Who you protecting? Guerra?
- Guerra.

53
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,486
- Yeah, Guerra made me lie.
- Why?

54
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,893
I don't know.
Maybe he sold the drugs to Augustus.

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,160
All right.
Get out of here.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,860
We need to have a
sit-down with Morales.

57
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,266
Morales,

58
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,537
did Guerra give Augustus
those drugs?

59
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,043
No.

60
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:43,475
- You lying.
- Know what, Redding?

61
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,780
You and me,
since we made peace,

62
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,048
we've had a good
thing going.

63
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,817
Don't blow it
by being an asshole.

64
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,586
Motherfucker.

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,185
Who the fuck you think
you're calling an asshole?!

66
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,526
What the fuck you
think you're doing?

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,907
John and Jane Doe
decided to go on a diet,

68
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,385
eat better, get healthy, live longer.
What could be wrong with that?

69
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,479
Well, studies now show

70
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,650
that the stress John suffers
from trying to lower his cholesterol

71
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,717
can do as much harm
as cholesterol itself:

72
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,661
That the stress can actually raise
his cholesterol.

73
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,723
And take those low-fat,
no-fat products.

74
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,257
Shit's loaded with sugar
to make it taste better.

75
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,202
So while Jane's
trimming down,

76
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,899
she's jacking up her blood sugar
and risking diabetes.

77
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,034
Bottled water. What the fuck could
be wrong with that?

78
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,942
The bottles, my friend.

79
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:50,005
1.5 million tons of plastic
are used for them each year,

80
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,643
which means more toxic gases
in the air we breathe.

81
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,846
So by going all natural,

82
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,582
we're actually
killing ourselves,

83
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,283
killing the whole
fuckin' planet.

84
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,621
Look at O'Reily.
He's been there all day.

85
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,294
Yeah, he's waiting for the verdict
on Cyril's murder trial.

86
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,031
The jury's still
deliberating.

87
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,505
- Think he'll get convicted?
- I hope not.

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,441
I like Cyril. I'd hate to see him
sent off to death row.

89
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,606
Ryan, what news?

90
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,205
Nothing.

91
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,275
The lawyer says
it could be a couple of days

92
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,412
before the jury
comes back with a verdict.

93
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,015
I just wish I was with Cyril
in solitary, 'cause I know he's scared,

94
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,458
and I don't think he has a clue
as to what's going on.

95
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,985
- Good.
- What's good?

96
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,395
Well, the less aware
he is of things,

97
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,367
the better chance we have
of overturning a guilty verdict.

98
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,835
I don't follow.

99
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,735
I'm not going
to let Cyril die,

100
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,672
not without one
hell of a fight.

101
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,675
What do you care
about my brother for, huh?

102
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,939
What fuckin' business
is it of yours?

103
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,812
Just because I'm a prisoner doesn't mean
I've stopped being a priest.

104
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,409
- Cyril is one of God's kids...
- Hey, Meehan! Yo!

105
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,512
You know what? Stay the fuck away
from me, all right?

106
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,023
The last thing I need
right now is hope, so just beat it.

107
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,025
Get the fuck
out of here.

108
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,160
What are you, deaf?

109
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,259
O'Reily,
come with me.

110
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,064
- Where?
- Jury's in.

111
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,536
Oh, take that.

112
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,103
Ryan.

113
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,707
- Oh, Christ.
- I'm sorry.

114
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,276
- We're going to appeal.
- A lot of fuckin' good that will do.

115
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,421
Hey, you okay?

116
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,721
Sure.

117
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,954
- Kiss Jericho.
- No, Cyril, I don't...

118
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,757
Kiss him!
He misses you.

119
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,867
- When's sentencing?
- It's Thursday.

120
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,462
I'll plead for clemency
because of his mental state.

121
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,667
- Don't.
- Why not? The judge...

122
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,576
I'm responsible for
his decisions, right?

123
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,706
I say no appeals,
no clemency.

124
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,651
Now leave us alone.

125
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,622
Is there
a problem, Ryan?

126
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,259
No, just the opposite.

127
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,538
You're getting
out of here, kid.

128
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,541
You're going
to be free.

129
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,580
Why would you want
your brother to die?

130
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,412
Look at our lives.

131
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,577
We were beaten
as kids, ignored,

132
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,417
in and out of juvie
all the time.

133
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,514
Then Cyril gets
his brain smashed in,

134
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,220
and we're stuck in this shithole
for the next 90 years.

135
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,253
Nothingness is better
than a lifetime in Oz.

136
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,596
Once he's gone,
he's gone forever,

137
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,762
and you will have to live every day
with the part you played in that.

138
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,001
Believe me, I accept everything
I've done to screw up Cyril's life.

139
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,134
- I can carry this.
- No.

140
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,906
- No, you won't be able to.
- And what makes you say that?

141
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,312
- Because I know you, Ryan.
- What?!

142
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,407
You think
you know me?

143
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,351
Because we sit around and jaw,
you got me all figured out?

144
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,016
Is that it, huh?
Well, let me tell you something, Ma.

145
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,787
Even if you'd been in that house
my whole life,

146
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,818
you wouldn't have
a fuckin' clue who I am.

147
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,894
- Ryan.
- Let me out of here!

148
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,095
Ryan?

149
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,628
The only way to win this case on appeal
is in the court of public opinion.

150
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,504
In 1989,
the Supreme Court ruled

151
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,341
that executing the mentally retarded was
not a violation of the Eighth Amendment,

152
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,506
because there's no national
consensus against such punishment.

153
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,675
So we have to demonstrate
in court now

154
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,617
that there is a consensus,

155
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,177
that even Americans who believe
in the death penalty

156
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,624
find these particular executions
to be cruel and unusual punishment.

157
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,320
We need to get
the media aroused.

158
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,488
Sister, can you get
out a press release

159
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,760
to the effect that it's
impossible to determine

160
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,926
the extent of Cyril's
culpability?

161
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,993
I mean, he knew he
did something wrong,

162
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,266
but he has no sense
of the gravity.

163
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,365
A press release isn't enough.
We should hold a press conference.

164
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,399
I want to make it clear
that I was never able

165
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,503
to discuss the specifics
of the case with Cyril,

166
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,980
that he did not actively
participate in his own defense.

167
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,711
Father Meehan, do you really think
we can pull this off?

168
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,811
The law is like
God Almighty Himself...

169
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,378
it moves in strange ways,

170
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,414
so we have to keep nudging it toward
a more merciful outcome.

171
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,929
Hey, everybody, check
it out. Shupe's back.

172
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,230
Let's give him a hand.

173
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,668
You're a regular
Chris Rock there, O'Reily.

174
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,229
- What can I say? It's a talent.
- Speaking of talents,

175
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,800
you made a deal with us. We'd hurt Shupe
if you airholed Jia Kenmin.

176
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,472
Well, I never said
I'd do the deed myself.

177
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,346
I'm gonna find someone to do it
who the C.O. S can't blame.

178
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,546
- Who?
- The C.O. S themselves.

179
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,868
I hear justice
has been served.

180
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,135
Your brother's going to die
for whacking Li Chen.

181
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,772
My only wish is that you'd been
in court the day I testified.

182
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,273
Li Chen, he was a good man
who wouldn't hurt a flea.

183
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,514
I even choked back
a fuckin' tear.

184
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,249
I was brilliant.

185
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,158
Hey, wonton.

186
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,394
Get off him.
Get off him now.

187
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,303
Fuckin' cocksucker.

188
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,271
Son of a bitch!

189
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,290
You're going
to be fine.

190
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,060
- How you feeling?
- Sore.

191
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,501
- How's Jia?
- I didn't get to see him.

192
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,595
The C.O. S threw him directly
into solitary.

193
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,299
It's not nice to hit
the hacks.

194
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,934
Given his previous concussion,
I'm a little worried.

195
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,207
Don't be. It's better for all of us
if Jia goes back into another coma.

196
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,976
I'll get someone
to take you back.

197
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,448
I'll take him.

198
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,147
Appreciate what
you did today, O'Reily.

199
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,053
If you hadn't gotten
there when you did,

200
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,582
that chink would have snapped my
neck. I was just returning the favor.

201
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,822
Yeah, Jia, man, he's got some
set of balls.

202
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,696
He's always talking about what pussies
you hacks are.

203
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,996
Yeah? Well, he's got
a lesson coming.

204
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,865
He'll learn.

205
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,237
Hey, Jia.

206
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,714
How's the head?

207
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,478
Fuck you.

208
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,420
See, I would call that
an act of aggression.

209
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,787
Oh! Jeez!

210
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,635
You happy with
what you did?

211
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,505
What'd I do?

212
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,239
Got your revenge
on Jia Kenmin.

213
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,373
- That motherfucker came at me.
- I saw otherwise.

214
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,474
Hey, keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

215
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,914
You wear that
cross of gold. Why?

216
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,790
Do you believe in the risen Christ,
or is it just a bauble?

217
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,625
What happened to you
when you were a child?

218
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,188
What made you walk away
from the church?

219
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,360
- I didn't walk away, I ran.
- Why?

220
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,565
When I was a kid...

221
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,006
and all the shit was
going down at our house,

222
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,101
my dad was wailing
on us non-stop,

223
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,237
so I went
to our pastor.

224
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,907
I had a welt on my back
the size of this fist.

225
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,142
So I asked
the good monsignor

226
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,552
if he could please talk to my dad
and ask him to stop beating on us.

227
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,456
He said if my dad hit us,
it was because we were bad

228
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,221
and we deserved
to be punished.

229
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,890
Then he told me to go home
and "honor thy father."

230
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,332
There are bad priests,

231
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,132
but there are lots
of good ones too.

232
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,732
Your priest wasn't there
for you, but I am.

233
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,208
I'm here for you,

234
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,805
and I'm here
for your brother.

235
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,509
No, it's too late,
Father.

236
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,883
It's too fuckin' late.

237
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,957
John and Jane Doe,
both looking slim and sexy,

238
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,397
meet, fall in love,
decide to get married.

239
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,799
John buys a nice fat diamond
for Jane's finger.

240
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,862
Sweet, except for the fact
that people in Africa

241
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,773
are living in shit
because of those precious little stones.

242
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,174
Men are dying every day
in dangerous mines.

243
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,406
Men are dying every day
in civil wars

244
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,744
fought to control
the diamond trades.

245
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,273
Anyway, John and Jane
get married,

246
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,115
start pumping out
the kids.

247
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,714
Shit, even God told Adam and Eve
to be fruitful and multiply,

248
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,487
but now we've multiplied
to the point of plague...

249
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,653
six billion
and counting.

250
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,461
Suddenly, my cell
don't seem so cramped.

251
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,266
I don't know how I'm going
to give Julie up.

252
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:42,206
I had a kid once. Died.

253
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,176
It fuckin' nearly
crippled me.

254
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,077
I ain't felt love
since then,

255
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,910
until now.

256
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,611
You know that C.O.
That you blinded?

257
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,643
- Eugene Rivera?
- Yeah. Is he going to get your dog?

258
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,521
No. He shouldn't.
He don't want any part of anything

259
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,252
that had to do with me.

260
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,592
You ever seen these
babies fight for sport?

261
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,530
I've seen roosters.

262
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,830
- I haven't seen dogs, though.
- It's fuckin' brutal, man.

263
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,234
Three rounds
of absolute mayhem.

264
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,966
Dogs just rippin'
each other apart.

265
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:18,466
- Jesus Christ, fuckin' stop!
- I'm sorry.

266
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,917
Hey, Penders,
Alvarez, what's this?

267
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,117
Beats me.

268
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,592
It's dogshit,
dickhead.

269
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,959
How can you be sure
that a dog did that?

270
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,192
Who else shits on
the floor?

271
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,928
Guerra.

272
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,492
That's funny.
Clean it up.

273
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,766
- No.
- No?

274
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,832
- No.
- Clean the fuckin' shit up.

275
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,810
Lopresti, why you always
on my fuckin' ass?

276
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,780
Because I'm tired of you
and your fuckin' pooch.

277
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,975
At least Chester
doesn't have bad breath.

278
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,450
Chester, now!

279
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,468
- Yes, yes, Chester.
- Damn!

280
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,246
It's a shame
what Penders did,

281
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,941
teaching Chester
to attack.

282
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,383
He put a shadow
over the whole program.

283
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,887
He really loved
the dog.

284
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,821
He just fuckin'
hates people.

285
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,289
Let her take you
up the stairs.

286
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,190
- What else?
- Have her sit.

287
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,533
Julie, sit.

288
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,100
Good girl. And?

289
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,666
Now take off
your blindfold.

290
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,516
- I pass?
- Yes. A plus.

291
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,519
Gold star.
Great job.

292
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,952
Thanks.

293
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,682
She did all the work,
you know.

294
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,054
And she'll continue to do so,
thanks to you.

295
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,825
You know what I wish?

296
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,060
I wish I could just see
whoever's going to get her, you know?

297
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,501
Well, Miguel...

298
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,697
you're going
to get your wish,

299
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,104
'cause that person will
be here in just a second.

300
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,805
- Who's that?
- McManus has been working the phones...

301
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,245
Oh, shit.

302
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,512
I thought
he didn't want her.

303
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,746
Tina didn't.

304
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,756
Well, neither did I, at first.

305
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,725
Look...

306
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,559
I love my wife and everything
she's done for me,

307
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,895
but she deserves
her life back.

308
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,299
I mean, I know this dog
would be great for me,

309
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,497
but I think...

310
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,200
over time it would be
great for her too.

311
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,699
That's good.
Cool.

312
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,212
This is Julie,

313
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,772
- and I trained her special for you.
- Special?

314
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,410
What do you normally
speak at home?

315
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,010
Spanish.

316
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,853
Now make believe you're at home
right now and ask for her.

317
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,155
Julie...

318
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,332
- You taught the dog Spanish?
- Yeah.

319
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,699
Yeah. Every command,
she's fuckin' bilingual.

320
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,002
Tell her to sit down.

321
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,498
Julie...

322
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,512
She's all yours.

323
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,228
Come on, Eugene.

324
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,905
Let's go.

325
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,911
Well, congratulations, Tim.
You're two for two.

326
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,441
Both the music program
and the Man's Best Friend

327
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,612
have had tangible
and positive results.

328
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,383
- Hear! Hear!
- Thank you.

329
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,414
I just want
to tell you both

330
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,050
that I appreciate
your support,

331
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,459
as guarded and as
half-assed as it's been.

332
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,896
Ouch. I was wondering what happened
to that backhand of yours.

333
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,665
Oh, I've gotta go.
I'm due over at Lardner.

334
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,105
Leo, Timmy.

335
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,173
Well, there certainly
has been a thaw

336
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,808
in your icy relationship
with the governor's office.

337
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,750
- Huh?
- If I didn't know better,

338
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,583
I'd say you had a liaison
with the state liaison,

339
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,715
if not last night,
then very recently.

340
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,453
Yeah,
I gotta go too.

341
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,017
Okay, "Timmy."

342
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,398
51.

343
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,598
Yeah! Jesus Christ,
I fucking won!

344
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,437
That winning ticket
was mine, damn it!

345
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,569
- Have I got any legal recourse?
- No. No.

346
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,340
I mean, even if
we could find him,

347
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,474
it's Dave Brass'
word against yours.

348
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,507
He's a C.O. Injured
in the line of duty:

349
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,076
You, a prisoner known
to talk to God.

350
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,385
That bastard!

351
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,085
He should be arrested
for killing my grandson.

352
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,118
Alex Jr.'s only chance to beat
the leukemia is to find a donor,

353
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,029
- someone willing to give bone marrow.
- I know.

354
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:44,058
I thought because of his unique
ethnic mix, a match was difficult.

355
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,434
The difficulty
is that no one is looking.

356
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,099
- There must be someone out there.
- Or here.

357
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,338
I'll bet if you search the computer files of
every prisoner in Oz,

358
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,140
past or present,
you'd get a match.

359
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,377
Well, why don't I?

360
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,441
- What?
- Search the files.

361
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,714
You'd do that
for me?

362
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,187
For you,
for your grandson,

363
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,453
for Dave Brass,
for my own peace of mind.

364
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,426
Martinez.

365
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,992
- They're shipping your ass to solitary.
- Yeah.

366
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,629
Listen, I could
help you out.

367
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,469
A word from me
and you're sitting in Unit B,

368
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,169
- maybe even Emerald City.
- Yeah?

369
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,110
And why would
you help me?

370
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,448
You doused Dave Brass
for no apparent reason.

371
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,453
Only I'm thinking
you had a reason,

372
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,387
and I'm thinking
if you tell me,

373
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,414
that's maybe
when I could step up for you.

374
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,655
I got nothing to say.

375
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,562
You attacked
a C.O., Carlos.

376
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,090
Where you're going,
you've got no friends.

377
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:55,095
If you don't get smart, you're going to
hurt a lot more than you do now!

378
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,605
Martinez is cracking.

379
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:08,017
We're so close to him jabbering
all the names of everybody involved,

380
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,250
and my guess is
Enrique Morales tops the list.

381
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,917
Good. None of that'll do much good
for Rebadow, though.

382
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,258
I mean, even if we find Brass
and tell him who cut him,

383
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,230
he's not going to give
that lottery money back.

384
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,195
Yes.

385
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,101
Yes, yes.

386
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,662
- Got it.
- Got what?

387
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,174
Salvation.

388
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,346
Farai Gyrobile is a Rastafarian
from Unit C.

389
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,747
It turns out him and Bob Marley
have more in common

390
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,049
than just reggae.
Both of them have white fathers.

391
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,885
And was his mother half West Indian
and half Guatemalan?

392
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,824
Yeah, so he appears to be
the perfect match for your grandson.

393
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,454
Now all you've got to do is convince
him to be the bone marrow donor.

394
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,329
May I talk
to this man alone,

395
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,462
- prisoner to prisoner?
- Of course.

396
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,303
Good luck.

397
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,876
Farai?

398
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,849
Bob.
Bob Rebadow.

399
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:15,375
The guy who got aced out
of two million Mightyball dollars?

400
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,411
Yes.
You see...

401
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,323
I needed to win that money
on account of my grandson.

402
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,885
- He's dying of leukemia.
- Pity.

403
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,421
Which is why
I need your help.

404
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,232
Alex has a very
specific racial makeup,

405
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,603
- which you match exactly.
- How the fuck you know?

406
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,074
McManus told me.
And I was hoping

407
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:42,205
you might be willing to donate
your bone marrow to my grandson.

408
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,683
McManus has no right
sharing that shit with you.

409
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:49,448
Everyone here thinks
my blood be black, 100%.

410
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,651
I fuckin' donate,
and they all know different.

411
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:57,424
And if you tell a soul,
you're as dead as your grandboy.

412
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,754
No, wait.

413
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,238
I'm sorry, Alex.

414
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,940
I tried.

415
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,462
God spoke to me
last night.

416
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,124
He told me that
the missing element

417
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,692
in Alex Jr.'s
recovery is faith.

418
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,533
Uh-huh.

419
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,005
Not money,
not science.

420
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,667
I want to find
a faith healer,

421
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,404
someone who will
go to my grandson in the hospital,

422
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,847
lay hands on him, flush out
the leukemia once and for all.

423
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,817
- I see.
- You're wary.

424
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:58,687
What little I do know
of faith healers gives me pause.

425
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:03,854
A lot of people expecting
a miracle get deception instead.

426
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,522
Okay.

427
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,294
So you don't choose the bruised fruit.
You look carefully.

428
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,267
For whatever
it's worth,

429
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,202
the kind of people
you're talking about

430
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,468
are not typically
sanctioned by any church.

431
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:21,036
Sister Pete, I didn't say religious
healer, denominational healer.

432
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,808
I said faith healer...

433
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,283
the faith that alone transcends
all cultural divisions and systems.

434
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,116
Aren't you sick
of the club mentality

435
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,554
surrounded by members
of other clubs?

436
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,080
Who belongs to what,

437
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,592
what and which one
has the upper-hand on God?

438
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:40,120
I mean no offense,
but I don't want to belong,

439
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,692
- I just want to believe.
- So what happens next?

440
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,896
I wait for instructions.

441
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,905
I wait for the word.

442
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,375
I am an arrow
in God's bow.

443
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,456
How long has he got?

444
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,689
What?

445
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,094
Your grandson,
how long has he got?

446
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,726
Who are you?

447
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,465
A. R. Whitworth.

448
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,836
How long has he got?

449
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,603
I don't know.
Only God does.

450
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,134
Good answer.

451
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,772
- Now we're talking.
- About what?

452
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,112
Faith healing.
Right?

453
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,719
How do you know that?

454
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,847
Would you believe
that last night

455
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,086
I dreamt that your grandson
was restored to perfect health?

456
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,358
Maybe.

457
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,057
Go on.

458
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,531
All right.

459
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,932
I was born a gimp...

460
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:55,065
spinal shit,
impossible to fix.

461
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:59,167
When I was in high school, found out
that my neighbor's a faith healer,

462
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,508
born with x-ray vision.

463
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,141
She denied it for years,
said it embarrassed her.

464
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,119
Then she goes and heals
a friend and the word spreads.

465
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,358
All this time,
right next door to me.

466
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,656
I was pissed off at first,
to tell you the truth.

467
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,255
But she's
the real deal.

468
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,356
No showbiz shit.

469
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,233
But you still
limp a little.

470
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,397
Just started
bothering me again.

471
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,999
But still, it's better
than what it used to be.

472
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,303
God may hold the key
to your grandson's health,

473
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,780
to heal him,

474
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,876
but he's holding
a key inside of the boy.

475
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,716
Regina can turn it.

476
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,847
Absolutely not!

477
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,983
- Sarah, listen to me.
- I have listened to you.

478
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,960
There will be
no strange woman

479
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:54,090
doing some sort of seance
or voodoo over Alex Jr.'s bed.

480
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,226
- I will not have it.
- Put aside your prejudices a moment,

481
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,793
- take Mother and go meet her.
- No.

482
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,035
There is no way I'm going
to dangle that kind of carrot

483
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,009
in front of a terminally-ill
10-year-old.

484
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,773
The boy is
too fragile.

485
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,373
Say it doesn't work,
Robert. What then?

486
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,475
We tell him that God
didn't love him enough?

487
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,952
I don't want
little Alex to die.

488
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,581
We're waiting
and praying

489
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,682
for a bone marrow
transplant.

490
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,421
Waiting and praying,
waiting and praying.

491
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,453
What about doing,
God damn it?

492
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,159
Cool down, Rebadow.

493
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,326
Step back.
This is a family matter.

494
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,599
I want to stand
on a mountaintop

495
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,038
and curse our idiotic,
modern small-mindedness,

496
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:40,443
our lame, civilized methods
of surviving sickness.

497
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,572
Hospitals are the summit
of human potential?

498
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,242
Bull-fuckin'-shit!

499
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,080
- Are you finished?
- No.

500
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:51,384
- I'll find someone to visit Regina.
- Who?

501
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,051
The only reason you called me
instead of Alex, Sophie or Mother

502
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,288
is because you knew
they would need convincing.

503
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,888
No. There is no one in our family
who is going

504
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,525
to let that strange woman
into Alex Jr.'s room.

505
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,694
You can't do this.

506
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,636
Yes, I can.

507
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,832
You know what I see?

508
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,675
I see a man trying to redeem himself
in the eyes of his family,

509
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:19,081
making a last-ditch effort
after decades of absence.

510
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:23,281
See, sometimes
I have x-ray vision too.

511
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,552
Why?

512
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,054
Why open this door
just to close it in my face?

513
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,229
Be healed...

514
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,177
in the name of God.

515
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,746
Our Lady of Fatima church
and its rectory

516
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,652
burned to the ground
this evening, killing two priests.

517
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,588
Also injured was
Father Raymond Mukada,

518
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,488
who suffered
from smoke inhalation

519
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,016
and is in serious condition
at Benchley Memorial Hospital.

520
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,690
I don't want to hear any more, Seroy.
You're going to solitary.

521
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,596
Warden, wait.

522
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,534
What if I give you some intel?
Will you give me a reprieve?

523
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,170
- What kind of intel?
- About Father Mukada.

524
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,402
What if I tell you
the fire at Mukada's church

525
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,742
was requested
by a prisoner here at Oz?

526
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,772
- Who?
- Huh-uh. Not until we have a deal.

527
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,585
Clarence Seroy is
a lying sack of shit.

528
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,821
That's what you said when Jaz Hoyt
implicated you in Jim Burns' murder.

529
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,091
- I'm innocent.
- No, you're a guilty little prick

530
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,861
who's going to take responsibility
for the shit storms you created.

531
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,127
You've got
no hard-core evidence

532
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,072
that either I set up the arson
or was involved in Hoyt killing Burns.

533
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,167
It's still their word
against mine.

534
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,440
Think you got
the system beat, huh?

535
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,414
Well, I've been around
a lot longer than you, Kirk.

536
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,749
Ray Mukada is
a friend of mine.

537
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,756
He's lying in a hospital
and that's pissing me off...

538
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,088
pissing me off royal.

539
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,658
It's your testimony
versus Kirk's.

540
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,397
He claims to have had nothing to do
with Burns' murder.

541
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,634
- He says you're lying.
- I'm on death row. Why would I lie?

542
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,074
What we need is
another witness.

543
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,441
One of your biker buddies
has got to come forward.

544
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,936
- They do that, they end up here.
- Not necessarily.

545
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,179
If they didn't participate in the crime,
I give them a free pass.

546
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,845
All your buddy's
got to say

547
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,219
is he heard Kirk propose
the murder to you.

548
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,917
Done.

549
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,968
Timothy Kirk,

550
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,907
you are hereby charged
with the murder of James Burns.

551
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,410
- What?
- My friend Max here

552
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,380
just corroborated Jaz Hoyt's
version of the truth.

553
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,076
- In solitary until the trial starts.
- No.

554
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,880
- Murder one... death row.
- No.

555
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,683
- I didn't... Warden, please.
- "He who comes in with vanity

556
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,349
- shall go out in darkness..."
- I'm sorry.

557
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,654
"...and his name shall be
covered in darkness.

558
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,661
He shall
never see the sun."

559
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,225
And finally,
I'm happy to announce

560
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,063
that Ray Mukada
will be released

561
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,229
from Benchley Memorial
tomorrow afternoon.

562
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,170
When is he coming
back to work?

563
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,004
Well, the doctors aren't sure yet,
but we hope soon.

564
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,710
Okay, that's all.

565
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,979
Peter Marie...

566
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,810
you haven't
said a word to me

567
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,377
since our little discussion
about Peter Schibetta.

568
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,390
"Little discussion"?

569
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,087
You know, Leo, when you
decided not to resign, I was thrilled.

570
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:54,588
But since then
you've become intransigent.

571
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:58,625
Keller can't see Beecher...
Schibetta, Alvarez.

572
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,365
It seems like when you get
an attitude about some guy,

573
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,273
boy, you just don't want to hear
anything else,

574
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,606
and I don't work
that way.

575
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:13,077
Speaking to Dr. Nathan
really helped me.

576
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,585
Hearing her thoughts
about being raped

577
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,214
- helped me to feel not so alone.
- That's great.

578
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,225
- That's good.
- So what's the next step?

579
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,420
That's up to you.

580
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,952
I would like to schedule
a session with your wife.

581
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:29,262
I'm not ready
to face her yet.

582
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,165
All right.

583
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,102
And perhaps
you should think

584
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,628
about interacting with the men
who attacked you.

585
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,368
How do you feel
about that?

586
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,273
No.

587
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,800
No way.

588
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,712
I'm no rat. I'm not going
to give up any names.

589
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,409
Why would you want
to protect them?

590
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,213
I didn't say
I'm protecting them.

591
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,719
You're going
to get revenge?

592
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,018
- I didn't say that either.
- Peter.

593
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,047
Just let it go.

594
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,027
Okay, for now.

595
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,621
I want to ask you
one more thing.

596
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,191
What's your relationship
with Warden Glynn?

597
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,669
So there is bad blood
between you.

598
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,301
Maybe we need
to let that go too, Sister.

599
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,578
Yeah, let that go too.

600
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,655
Hey, Petey.

601
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,753
Nice ass.

602
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,370
John and Jane
raise their kiddies

603
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,962
to be decent citizens,

604
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,201
teach them the laws
of political correctness,

605
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,338
teach them to respect other races,
genders, body shapes, beliefs.

606
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,609
But think about it.

607
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,446
Doesn't making our children
too aware of the differences

608
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,213
plant the same seed
of separateness?

609
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,120
Are we blinding
little Jane and John Jr.

610
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,751
So they only see what makes us different
and not what makes us alike?

611
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,461
Hey.

612
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,429
Feeling better?

613
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,164
Those painkillers are
fuckin' with your brain.

614
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,432
You've been sitting there
for two days.

615
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,769
You don't talk,
you don't eat with us.

616
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,435
Not to mention you got me worried
about this gum shit now.

617
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,968
Can't tell if they're
recessive or not.

618
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,378
Take a hike, girls.

619
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,644
Yes, sir.

620
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,413
- Vern.
- Yeah.

621
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,682
I don't know
who the donor was,

622
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,713
where that fuckin' dentist
got the gum tissue from,

623
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,319
whose cadaver.
Could be anyone's.

624
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,565
Get the fuck
out of here.

625
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,537
The shit's anonymous,

626
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,598
stored in some
fuckin' freezer somewhere.

627
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,973
How am I supposed
to know to ask?

628
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,944
Don't look at me
like that.

629
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,140
When exactly did this come up?

630
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,809
While I was whacked on gas
and under the knife.

631
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,148
That scum-sucking
towelhead,

632
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,313
he's fuckin' with me
in the middle of surgery.

633
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,585
Christ Almighty.

634
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,055
Is it normal color
at least, the gum tissue?

635
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,928
I don't know.

636
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,832
- I haven't looked.
- You haven't looked?

637
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:20,234
You haven't paid a follow-up visit
to Dr. Faraj to find out?

638
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,338
He won't be in again
until Thursday.

639
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,743
Listen, nobody
hears about this,

640
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,805
especially not
in the Brotherhood.

641
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,929
So, Vern,
am I right in deducing

642
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,565
that the reason I drove 80 miles
to hear this pathetic story

643
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,371
is because you don't know
what effect

644
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,401
James Robson's
little dental dilemma

645
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,243
is going to have on his standing
in the Brotherhood?

646
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,241
- Yes, sir.
- And because you care about Robson.

647
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,153
- He's your friend.
- Yes, sir.

648
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,783
Well, let's see if you can answer
some of your own questions here,

649
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,658
and we'll see if my trip
was worth the time.

650
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,028
Define purity for me, Vern.

651
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,966
You see, I'm not concerned
about James Robson.

652
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,735
I never did care
much for the boy.

653
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,834
His type joins us more

654
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,404
out of an identity crisis
than true faith.

655
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,814
Sir, with all due respect,
Robson has proven himself.

656
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,842
With all due respect,
Vern, I don't give a shit.

657
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,082
What does
concern me is you,

658
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:49,252
that your convictions will falter
in this embarrassing situation,

659
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:52,126
that you will overlook
Robson's infection

660
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,654
because the two
of you are close.

661
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,532
We don't know
anything for sure yet.

662
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,832
Robson'll find out the truth
as soon as he can.

663
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,804
Just remember,

664
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,434
a little leaven
leavens the whole loaf.

665
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,535
That goes
for you as well.

666
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,308
And next time,
spare me the road trip.

667
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,713
Use the fuckin'
telephone.

668
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:18,116
Yo, by the way,
I got James Robson over in Unit B.

669
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,716
He was asking me if I can get him
a copy of your schedule this week.

670
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,093
There some sort of nastiness
going on between you two?

671
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,792
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

672
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,733
He was just
all on edge,

673
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,736
in a darker mood
than most days.

674
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,762
You look kind of
freaked out yourself.

675
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,273
Shit.

676
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,007
Shit, shit, shit.

677
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,182
Quitting?
As of when?

678
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,776
- Today.
- Today?

679
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,118
Jesus, Tariq, a little advanced
notice would have been nice.

680
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,317
Leo, I didn't see it
coming, really.

681
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,417
You can't give me
the rest of the week?

682
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,952
Look, I'll finish out my shift,
and then that's all.

683
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,228
Here, these are some contacts
that could probably help you out.

684
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,464
First Kochurn, now you. Why can't I
hold on to a dentist around here?

685
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,667
- I'm sorry, Leo.
- Bullshit!

686
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,402
Yeah, I guess so.

687
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,680
Do me a favor...

688
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,060
Spread that around.

689
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,027
And don't tell anyone
where you heard it, okay?

690
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,835
Faraj should be in by now.
I'm going to corner him after lunch.

691
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,904
You don't want to talk much
until then, is that the deal?

692
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,812
I'm not handling this
any different than the next guy would,

693
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,213
so give me
a fuckin' break.

694
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,381
- Just soup.
- Sure you don't want

695
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,116
no chitlins and gravy
to go with that?

696
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,386
What?

697
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,950
Shall we?

698
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,728
Everyone, listen up.

699
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:13,897
Robson here went to the dentist
and got a pair of dirty ghetto gums.

700
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,047
- Thanks, Vern.
- I didn't say a fuckin' word.

701
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,381
Shut up, you goddamn nigger.
Give him some soup.

702
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,410
Whoa, you gonna
take that, G...

703
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,479
man calling your brother
a nigger and all?

704
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,115
Hey, don't get stupid.

705
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,854
Don't want me to Sammy Sosa
that jaw with this here spoon.

706
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,192
Keep it moving, girls.

707
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,733
I need to see Dr. Faraj.

708
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,965
- My mouth is killing me.
- You poor baby.

709
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,530
Follow me.

710
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,446
Dr. Faraj, hi.

711
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,853
Now who's the fuckin'
donor, huh?

712
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,518
I have a wife.
I have kids. Please.

713
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,289
- Don't make me fuckin' slip.
- No, no, he was white.

714
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,057
He was like you.
He was just your age.

715
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,896
Prove it. Call the fuckin'
lab or whatever.

716
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,098
I'll prove it. Could you just please
go get me my address book

717
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,402
from other there, okay?

718
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,638
- He wasn't white. I made sure of that.
- Fuck!

719
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,081
What's done is done.
Officer!

720
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,013
He attacked me.

721
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,454
Must be
his gums acting up.

722
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,330
Now...

723
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:55,896
you all know how highly
I've esteemed James Robson...

724
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,899
but the past,
unfortunately,

725
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,003
is nothing more
than the past.

726
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,810
Satan has scored
a very ugly victory,

727
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,681
and it pains me that
Robson is a casualty.

728
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:12,917
We must, nevertheless, abide
by principles, not feelings.

729
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:17,394
As of today, James Robson
is no longer a part of the Brotherhood.

730
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,373
- Hello, Chris.
- Sister.

731
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,403
You have to talk in this ear. This one
doesn't work too good anymore.

732
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:41,748
Yeah. Dr. Nathan says the hearing loss
may be permanent.

733
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,346
Eh, that'll give me a real excuse
for ignoring people.

734
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:49,883
She also says you'll be sent back
to protective custody tomorrow.

735
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,157
Just in time
for my trial.

736
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:57,156
- How do you like your new lawyer?
- I think I'm gonna lose.

737
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:03,404
- How do you feel about that?
- Angry.

738
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,806
I don't want to end
my days on death row.

739
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,373
I'll pray for you.

740
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,644
- Do you think Jesus was a fag?
- What?

741
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,347
You think Jesus was a fag?
It's a legitimate question.

742
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,880
Are you trying to provoke me,
mock my religion?

743
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:24,360
No, just looking
for a role model.

744
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,863
Jesus was divine...

745
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,956
and human
simultaneously, right?

746
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:36,933
Did the divine part
control his sexual appetites?

747
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,942
And if so,
what chance have I got?

748
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,876
I'm not divine,
far from it.

749
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,606
All my life...

750
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:46,138
anytime
I've gotten the urge,

751
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,311
I've stuck my cock
into any cavity

752
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,913
that was open
and available.

753
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,617
That's what's led me
to this point in time,

754
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,058
this precipice of death.

755
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,723
If I'd have been celibate,
do you think I'd have been happier?

756
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,929
- We fight our natures, Chris.
- Why?

757
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,994
God gives us natures.
What, for us to fight them?

758
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,474
It proves we're
better than animals.

759
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,171
I guess I failed
that test.

760
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,244
- You shouldn't think that way.
- What? I can't hear you.

761
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,162
I see the Aryans
have snatched your friend Adam.

762
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,730
Yeah.
It's my fault.

763
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,635
How so?

764
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:46,871
L... I don't want to go
into all the gory details.

765
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,209
- I delivered Adam into Schillinger's
hands. - Why?

766
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,978
Because Schillinger could arrange
for me to see Keller.

767
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:57,282
The irony is I didn't see Keller.
He was sent to Benchley Memorial

768
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,346
before I could get
to protective custody.

769
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,552
So to satisfy
your desires,

770
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,223
sexual or otherwise,
you sacrificed the boy.

771
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,926
I was convinced that Adam
deserved to get raped.

772
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,266
He raped that girl,
he attacked me.

773
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:16,136
But when I saw him
in the gym, l...

774
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,784
I realized that no matter what Adam
had done, no one deserves that.

775
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,879
My guilt is
devouring me.

776
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,790
So it should.

777
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,920
What can I do to make
peace with myself?

778
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,931
Well, I could tell you,

779
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:45,594
- but you want to hear it?
- Go on.

780
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:50,134
This calamity was brought on
by your need to see Keller,

781
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,574
so the only way for
you to punish yourself

782
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:56,511
- is by you denying yourself Keller.
- You mean don't see him.

783
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,980
That's right.

784
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,646
Ever again?

785
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,949
That's right.

786
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,815
Christ.

787
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,021
If you are really
truly sorry, Beecher,

788
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,558
that's what
you must do.

789
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,391
I want to transfer
to another work detail.

790
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,872
You transferred to the mailroom
not even a week ago.

791
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,602
Yeah. I'm not enjoying it
as much as I thought I would.

792
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,372
- Is there trouble with Schillinger?
- No, I just realized

793
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,142
that pushing a cart around
isn't the best use of my talents.

794
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,207
- Sister Peter Marie's replaced you.
- I know.

795
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,617
The only opening's
in the women's dress factory.

796
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,178
- Fine.
- So wait a second.

797
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,124
Sewing hems on women's dresses
is a better use of your talent?

798
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,389
Don't fuckin' bullshit me.
What's going on?

799
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,055
Nothing.

800
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,859
All right.
All right.

801
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,423
This is a prison,
not an employment agency.

802
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,402
We try to accommodate people,
but we can't always.

803
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,997
Now you asked to
work in the mailroom.

804
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,269
Until you give me
a legitimate reason why you can't,

805
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,299
you stay in the fuckin'
mailroom! Go.

806
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,789
I have a special
delivery for Dr. Nathan.

807
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,357
- Can I help you?
- Where's Sister Pete?

808
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:56,332
- In a staff meeting.
- You're that sheriff from Unit J?

809
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,891
- Alvin Yood, yeah.
- Yeah.

810
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,200
- I'm Tobias Beecher.
- Hey.

811
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,832
- I used to have this job.
- And you gave it up?

812
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:08,504
- Yeah.
- Nothing personal, but you're a dolt.

813
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:12,572
Look, Sister Pete gets back
from her appointment,

814
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,050
can you give her
this note

815
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,383
and tell her to make
a meeting with Adam Guenzel?

816
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,289
He's in Unit B, and I think
he needs somebody to talk to.

817
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:24,453
- About what?
- She'll knows when she sees him.

818
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,927
Okay, I'll give her
your message.

819
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,525
Thanks.
So long.

820
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,967
Hey, Beecher,

821
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,904
don't take
any wooden nickels.

822
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:48,173
- How you doing, Adam?
- What do you care?

823
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,243
Look,

824
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,017
I'm sorry I let them
rape you, okay?

825
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,219
But it's this place, you know?
It got my head all fucked up.

826
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,620
Mine too.

827
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,224
We've got to be there
for each other, bro'.

828
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,758
What? You want
to borrow my lipstick?

829
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,432
Guenzel, Sister Peter
Marie has requested your presence.

830
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:15,843
- What for?
- My guess, to Saran Wrap your brain.

831
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,675
Hey, prag, come here.

832
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,884
You listen up.

833
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,982
You don't jabber one fuckin' word
to her about what we done to you.

834
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,722
- Yes, sir.
- And clean that shit off your face.

835
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,561
So that's it?

836
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:46,565
- You have nothing else to say?
- No, ma'am.

837
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,809
Tell me about your relationship
with Tobias Beecher.

838
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,872
I don't have a relationship
with Beecher.

839
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,577
We shared a cell
in Em City, that's all.

840
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,314
What about when you
were both outside?

841
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:00,721
Our families were friendly,
but he's 10 years older than me.

842
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,520
We never hung out
or anything.

843
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,962
What if I told you that he's very
concerned about you?

844
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,056
I'd tell you he's
a lying cocksucker.

845
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,358
I'm sorry
for swearing.

846
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,099
I've heard worse.

847
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,700
- Why is he a liar?
- He knows why.

848
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,769
- You don't want to tell me?
- Ask him.

849
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,717
Normally, my role
in these sessions

850
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,280
is to mediate,
to referee,

851
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,019
but today I'm gonna
be a little more aggressive.

852
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,993
Our subject is
Adam Guenzel.

853
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:44,123
I had a meeting with Adam Guenzel
when he first came to Oz.

854
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:48,365
Since then, his behavior patterns
have changed significantly.

855
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:51,966
Clearly, he has been
abused sexually,

856
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:55,967
and I suspect that the three of you
know the details.

857
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,105
Tobias?

858
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,547
He was raped...
gang raped about a week ago.

859
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,115
By whom?

860
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,460
I'm not investigating
this as a crime.

861
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,696
I just want
to help the boy.

862
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,727
Vern?

863
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,365
I don't know
what you're talking about.

864
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,844
Said...

865
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:32,406
can you shed
any light on this?

866
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,491
No.

867
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,761
Fine.

868
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:51,358
But I want you to know
that I am not letting this pass.

869
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,598
I'm going to be seeing
Adam Guenzel every single day

870
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,606
until I can get
him to open up,

871
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,074
until he can tell me
exactly what happened.

872
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,509
This session is closed.

873
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:05,481
I am sick of sitting
in the same room with you.

874
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,251
Adam Guenzel has
become a liability.

875
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,222
You think he'll
blab to the nun?

876
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,486
Mm-hmm.

877
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,085
Hey, prag,
get in here.

878
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,291
Yes, sir?

879
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,327
I've got good news.

880
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,234
We're gonna
help you escape.

881
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,451
Beecher,
I've got some news.

882
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,325
Adam Guenzel is dead.

883
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:55,990
What?

884
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,398
They just found
his body.

885
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,665
Evidently,
he was climbing the fence,

886
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,604
he was attempting
to escape.

887
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,870
He got past the barbed wire,
but then the fence...

888
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:10,005
- He was electrocuted.
- 4,000 volts, straight through him.

889
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,378
Fuck.

890
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,208
I'm sorry.

891
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,198
So, that road to hell

892
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,200
that's paved
with good intentions?

893
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,067
I'm not saying
to make a detour,

894
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,094
only that before you make
your first step,

895
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,471
consider
the consequences,

896
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,806
'cause good
can turn to bad

897
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:16,937
in the blink
of a fuckin' eye.
