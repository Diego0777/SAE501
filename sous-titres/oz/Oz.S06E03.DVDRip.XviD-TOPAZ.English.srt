1
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,523
The power of music.

2
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,696
Whether a concerto
or ballad or rap,

3
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,262
music stimulates us.

4
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,901
Yeah, it stimulates us.

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:54,243
Willy Shakespeare said, "If music
be the food of love, play on."

6
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,553
Hey!

7
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,955
You're supposed to be having
a farewell conversation.

8
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,652
Use your lips for talking.

9
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,991
- Asshole.
- You girls got one minute.

10
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,519
- Hey, asshole.
- Chris, come on.

11
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,089
Forget about him.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,227
There's a lot I want
to say before I go.

13
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,067
Look, I gotta tell ya,
I'm having a tough time

14
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,938
wrapping my head around
the reality of you being paroled.

15
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,772
Trust me, I won't
fully comprehend it

16
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,108
until I'm sipping
my first martini.

17
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,277
Toby, I'm...

18
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,049
I'm, uh...

19
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,887
What?

20
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm glad.

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,765
You're finally going to get some
time to spend with your kids.

22
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,862
Come on.

23
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,103
- What's really on your mind?
- Don't forget me.

24
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,177
Never.
And now that I'm out,

25
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,774
I'll be doubling my efforts
to overturn your death sentence.

26
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,647
I'm going to see you
more than before.

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,812
Even so, if I die,
don't forget me.

28
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,823
You are not gonna die.

29
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,291
When you say it,
I almost believe it's true.

30
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,021
It is true.

31
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,193
Time.

32
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,836
Time!

33
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,306
Asshole.

34
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,706
Chris, don't!

35
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,048
Fucker!

36
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,717
Hey, you got
anything for me?

37
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,158
Nope.

38
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,991
I love my Rosie.

39
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,532
Maricon!

40
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,261
Thanks.

41
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,241
Mayor Loewen?

42
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,446
Vernie, I wondered
when you'd pop up.

43
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,954
It's great
to see you, sir.

44
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,684
Is that mail
for me?

45
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,385
Oh, yes.

46
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,623
So are you comfortable?
Got everything you need?

47
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,257
Yeah, mm-hm.

48
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,929
You gave me
quite a scare.

49
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,494
When I heard you
almost choked to death.

50
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,208
When's the doctor
releasing you?

51
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,840
I get back to
Unit J tomorrow.

52
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,282
Christ.

53
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,616
- Sir?
- Another hate letter.

54
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,350
Some nigger says
I got off too easy.

55
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,325
Says he's got a cousin
here in Oswald

56
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,987
who's gonna airhole me.

57
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,657
- What does airhole mean?
- Kill.

58
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,725
Black bastard.

59
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,863
Don't worry, Your Honor,

60
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,373
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

61
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,467
Oh, yeah,
is that right, huh?

62
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,606
From what I hear, the Aryans
in Oswald are a sorry bunch.

63
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,514
That guy who saved me
from choking, Beecher.

64
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,745
I hear you've been
trying

65
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,186
to airhole him
for about six fucking years,

66
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,212
and all you have
to show for it

67
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,248
is that little scar
above your eye there.

68
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,125
I did have his son killed,
and his father.

69
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,153
What are you an idiot?

70
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,358
Saying shit
like that out loud?

71
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,993
You know, Vernie, I've got
to tell you, I never thought

72
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,401
you were the brightest bulb
in the chandelier.

73
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,872
You always had this huge ego

74
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,568
with nothing to back it up.

75
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,135
You always had these big plans
with no balls behind them.

76
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,773
Shit, if it weren't
for your daddy

77
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,545
I wouldn't have given you
the time of fucking day.

78
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,576
You're an embarrassment
to the Brotherhood.

79
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,881
I have balls.

80
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,485
Speak up, boy,
I can't hear you.

81
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,290
Nothing, sir.

82
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,514
How'd your meeting
with the mayor go?

83
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,482
Fuck him.

84
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,355
Well, it's been
nice knowing you.

85
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,920
You too, Yood.

86
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,489
You too, Yood?

87
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,428
Well, you're in
such a cheery mood

88
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,597
I'm not sure if
I should burden you

89
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,834
with the little info
I just learned.

90
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,145
I know who killed
your father.

91
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,579
Who?

92
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,814
Franklin Winthrop.

93
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,187
On orders from
Vern Schillinger.

94
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,521
I knew it.

95
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,224
Fuck.

96
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,598
I thought you might
want the facts now,

97
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,002
in case you decide to do
something before you leave.

98
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,097
Like what?

99
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,576
Schillinger murdered
your father.

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,842
Wilson Loewen's like
a father to Schillinger.

101
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,109
Tooth-for-tooth time.

102
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,459
So I said, "Ronnie,

103
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,587
you tell Nancy to keep
her panties on."

104
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,128
- And did he?
- No, when it came to that woman

105
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,567
the great communicator
had no voice at all.

106
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,765
This has been
enjoyable, Mayor,

107
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,900
but I have a meeting
over at Lardner.

108
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,468
Yeah, I have
to run as well.

109
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,810
Jimmy, could you stay
just two more minutes?

110
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,284
- Uh, yeah.
- I'll see you again.

111
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,479
Oh, I hope so,
darlin'.

112
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,491
You fucking cocksucker.

113
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,394
You swore to me that you would
never let me serve a day.

114
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,024
Wilson, they were
burning down the city.

115
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,296
Correction, they were
burning down their city,

116
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,326
their neighborhood,
their businesses.

117
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,237
The violence was
escalating, spreading...

118
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,106
So you send in the National Guard,
tear gas, rubber bullets.

119
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,542
What you don't do is
betray a lifelong friend.

120
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,809
What you don't do
is humiliate a man,

121
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,284
especially when that man knows
where the bodies are buried.

122
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,712
I want my pardon, Jimmy,
and I want it fucking today.

123
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,284
I'm not going to spend another
night in this cesspool, understand?

124
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,023
I don't care what kind of
political typhoon it causes.

125
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,930
If you don't
give me my pardon,

126
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,493
I will call a press conference
and I will tell tales, Jimmy.

127
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,701
Tales of corruption, tales
of graft, tales of voter fraud.

128
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,369
By the time I'm finished you'll
be sitting right next to me

129
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,106
in Unit J playing
par-fucking-cheesi.

130
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,614
All right.

131
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,016
I'll figure out a way.

132
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,988
Yeah, you always do, Jimmy.
That's why you're my boy.

133
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,330
Perry.

134
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,531
There's something
I want you to do.

135
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,733
Something that requires
enormous discretion.

136
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,614
So, here we are.

137
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,050
Yes.

138
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,282
But I'm not saying goodbye
because this is not goodbye.

139
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,887
My dad's law partners,
in his memory,

140
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,591
have decided to do pro bono
work for the prisoners.

141
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,361
Even though
I've been disbarred,

142
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,563
- I'm going to coordinate the office.
- That's great.

143
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,299
I'm glad, Tobias.

144
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,274
I'm glad some good will come out
of all the sadness you suffered.

145
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,207
I want to thank you both
for always being there.

146
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,283
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

147
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,495
I'll see you
tomorrow.

148
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,193
Tobias, do not
come back tomorrow.

149
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,260
Be with your family. Take the time
to play with your children.

150
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,671
And comfort my mother.

151
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,039
I promise you, Beecher,

152
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,840
I will find
who killed your father.

153
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,042
Yeah, uh-huh.

154
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,247
Hey, Beecher,
sign here.

155
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,963
Okay, you're free to go.

156
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,875
Free to go.

157
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,809
Free.

158
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,986
Free.

159
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,854
Be well.

160
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:46,537
"One good thing about music,
when it hits, you feel no pain.

161
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,472
So hit me with music."

162
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,169
Bob Marley.

163
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,671
Wilson Loewen
is dead.

164
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,882
Oh... well.

165
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,613
Oh, well.

166
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,923
Oh... well.

167
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,994
It amazes me some of the books
the prisoners read.

168
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,431
I mean,
Henry James?

169
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,460
They had to force-feed me
James in college.

170
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,268
I too thought it odd

171
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,706
that Pablo Rosa would want
to borrow "The Ambassadors."

172
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,937
He's 18,

173
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,971
in for murdering
a classmate.

174
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,178
Nice to know he's
expanding his horizons.

175
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,209
Turn the book over.

176
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,779
Is that blood?

177
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,690
He clubbed
his cellmate with it.

178
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,093
Pablo Rosa, huh?

179
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,994
What cell block's he in?

180
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,555
Why?

181
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,362
I know you want
to help people,

182
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,028
but you can't
reach a kid like that.

183
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,560
Which is exactly
why I should try.

184
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:33,638
Doesn't your boyfriend worry,
you coming in here every day?

185
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,082
Is that your not-so-subtle way
of asking if I'm involved?

186
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,312
Yes.

187
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,616
Well, Robert,

188
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,350
to me...

189
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,621
men are like books.

190
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,857
Sometimes I want
a romance,

191
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,364
sometimes a thriller,

192
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,426
sometimes maybe a trashy novel
to take to the beach.

193
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,334
And sometimes...

194
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,965
I want a classic.

195
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,773
But when I finish, it's back
on the shelves and on to the next.

196
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,210
You've never
been married?

197
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,713
Oh, no.

198
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,715
Then maybe...

199
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,013
you're reading too fast.

200
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,577
I'm voracious.

201
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:47,083
Prisoner #02R104...
Pablo Rosa;

202
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,679
convicted December 22nd,
2002;

203
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,622
involuntary manslaughter;

204
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,522
sentence... 18 years;

205
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,220
up for parole in 10.

206
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,358
Pablo?

207
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,529
Come on in.

208
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,101
What do you want?

209
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,943
I've been reading
through your records.

210
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,644
You're 18 with 18 years
left on your sentence?

211
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,277
I get parole in 10.

212
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,652
Okay, so...

213
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,418
how do you want
to spend that time?

214
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:29,291
Fast as fucking possible.

215
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,161
The thing is, Pablo,
that's not an answer

216
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:36,497
any more than
this is a weapon.

217
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,730
Did the job pretty good
if you ask me.

218
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,467
Not the job
it was meant to.

219
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,903
Tell me,
can you read?

220
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,311
- Sure.
- Do you enjoy it?

221
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,746
No.

222
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,443
Books are just
shit teachers give you.

223
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,213
- So you did go to school?
- Sometimes.

224
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,948
But not always because
you hated the shit

225
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,479
your teachers gave you,
right?

226
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,153
Well, can't expect everyone
to enjoy the same thing.

227
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,459
So what I'd like us to do is find
a book that's right for you.

228
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,397
- Why?
- Because when we do,

229
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,924
it'll make the time fly,
and that's what you want.

230
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,701
Tell me some of the things
that interest you.

231
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,969
Like what?

232
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,636
Like pussy and baseball?

233
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,611
Now we're cooking.

234
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,117
Hey, Rebadow, heard
you were in the library

235
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,120
checking out more
than just books.

236
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,612
I don't really care to dignify that
with a response.

237
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,388
Chill, man. I'm just a little
jealous, you know?

238
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,555
You got your old lady
on payroll, right?

239
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,397
I call mine twice, she won't even
so much as fart my way.

240
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,272
You and Busmalis
should switch places.

241
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,673
His girl keeps showing up,
but he won't see her.

242
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,143
Well shit, let me know
the next time she comes by.

243
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,341
Shit, I'll visit anything
in a skirt, man.

244
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,077
Norma's here today.

245
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,914
For some reason,
she asked for me.

246
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,546
Well shit, share the love.

247
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,079
Share the love.

248
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,319
Damn!

249
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,792
You think I can convince
Busmalis to visit with you,

250
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,560
but I can't.

251
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,261
He's impenetrable.

252
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,768
Oh, come on.

253
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,737
We both know Agamemnon.

254
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,933
What looks like a wall
is only an inch thick

255
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,966
over that tender
little heart of his.

256
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,843
Well, I'm no
cardiac surgeon.

257
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,610
I'm not sure how to cut
through the wall.

258
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,549
Say you saw me,

259
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,677
that I was crying.

260
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,450
- But you're not.
- But I do.

261
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,719
Every day.

262
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,158
And tell him this,

263
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,924
I'll show up one last time.

264
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,228
If he doesn't come,
even just to say farewell,

265
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,828
then I swear he'll never
hear from Norma Clark again.

266
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,735
Okay.

267
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,740
But I can't
promise success.

268
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,368
Please, Bob!

269
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,868
Do your best.

270
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,439
See?

271
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,974
Tears.

272
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,120
Where have you been?

273
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,649
You know I hate
playing solitaire alone.

274
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,390
Black four
on that five.

275
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,830
And this is why.

276
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,528
I just saw Norma.

277
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,196
What, my Norma?

278
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,070
- Agamemnon, calm down.
- Went behind my back.

279
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,268
Is there a reason
everyone's taking her side?

280
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,278
I'm of the mind you're both
on the same side.

281
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,304
Oh, and what are you,
Dr. Love?

282
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,943
And what's led you
to such a learned diagnosis?

283
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,715
For one, you called her
"my Norma."

284
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,019
You've got 12 years
left in Oz.

285
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,459
Do you really want to spend
that time angry and desolate?

286
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,588
Oh, what do you know?

287
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,896
You're busy mooning
over that librarian.

288
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,868
Yes.

289
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,464
Stella's conjured up
all sorts of feelings in me.

290
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,169
Reminding me of what
I was like when I was young,

291
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,938
passionate about architecture,

292
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,242
about Betty.

293
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,714
I was on the verge
of an extraordinary career,

294
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,411
an extraordinary life.

295
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,421
But I've been
alone 38 years,

296
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,151
and I'm just beginning
to make up for lost time.

297
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,489
You, you're choosing
to lose the time

298
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,791
you and Norma
have together.

299
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,165
Red queen on that king.

300
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,295
Yeah yeah,
I see it.

301
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,890
Little man, what was
that bullshit?

302
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,993
You didn't like
"Of Human Bondage"?

303
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,191
I thought it was
an instruction manual.

304
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,223
It was about
some crippled kid.

305
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,497
There's no pictures,
even.

306
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,697
Sorry.

307
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,330
Uh...

308
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,897
how about "Macbeth"?

309
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,274
The story of a brutal
Scottish warlord

310
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,006
who kills mercilessly
to gain power.

311
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,673
They're doing
a production here.

312
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,342
Yeah, sounds all right.

313
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,613
Well, Lady Macbeth,
what are you waiting for?

314
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,643
Get me my fucking book, man.

315
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,835
Hey, don't forget
my cookie.

316
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,428
Hey, Robson.

317
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,906
Hey, what shade of
lipstick is that, huh?

318
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,206
Dick-suck red?

319
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,908
Yeah, we heard you're working
receiving and discharge.

320
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,973
Uh-oh.

321
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,713
Fuck you, Pancamo.

322
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,620
I'll tell you what, prag,

323
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,988
this time, I'll use
my bad hand to beat you.

324
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,549
- Even it up a little.
- Bitch.

325
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,172
I was only talking.

326
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,340
- Since when's it against the rules?
- Since right now.

327
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,874
- "Since right now."
- Hey, what did I just say?

328
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,819
This is the problem, you got
zero listening ability.

329
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,484
So focus and either nod
or shake your head, got it?

330
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,118
That's a start.

331
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,596
Since Redding plans to move
over to telemarketing,

332
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,099
I'm giving you
back the kitchen.

333
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,034
Keep it efficient,

334
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,730
keep it clean,

335
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,432
keep it honest.

336
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,032
And in return
for my generosity

337
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,976
I want you to stay
the fuck away from the Aryans.

338
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,343
Got me?

339
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,507
Now, this is the part
where you say thanks.

340
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,414
Thanks.

341
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,419
You're welcome.

342
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,616
So, what'd you give
those Nazi fucks?

343
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,284
And now
you shut up again.

344
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,794
Psst, White.

345
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,424
White!

346
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,661
What, man, what?

347
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,465
How you feeling?

348
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,266
Better, thank God.
How about you?

349
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,035
Good, not great.
They tell you what we got?

350
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,543
No, man, only dribs
and drabs of shit.

351
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,637
Yeah, me too, but it can't
be that terrible

352
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,739
if Nathan sent us out
of the hospital that quick.

353
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,682
I wanna hear quiet!

354
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,778
- When's Martinez coming back?
- I don't know.

355
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,288
They tell you
what's ailing us yet?

356
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,347
I don't know!

357
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,783
Ah, see?

358
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,796
Quiet.

359
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,692
Let's give Gannon
10 milligrams.

360
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,534
Carlos Martinez...

361
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,405
He's one nasty man.

362
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,966
His liver is
deteriorating rapidly.

363
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,309
Let's up his
Aldactone 25 milligrams.

364
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,153
Martinez, you look
like fucking hell.

365
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,834
Brass giving you grief?

366
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,529
Always, man, always.

367
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,662
Listen up.

368
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,003
Morales is worried you're
going to tell Brass the truth

369
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,337
about how his ankle got cut.

370
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,242
No, I would never tell.
I swear on my life.

371
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,678
That's what Morales
had in mind.

372
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,545
He wants me to shank you.

373
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,378
I'm too weak
to fight, Chico.

374
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,391
Que estés fuerte.

375
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,557
Gracias, hermano.

376
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,691
Stay strong.

377
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,708
Is it done?

378
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,441
No.

379
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,109
I talked to Martinez.
He's not gonna jabber on you.

380
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,347
I told you to kill him.
That was an order.

381
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,378
He's a compadre.

382
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,980
You want him whacked?

383
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,616
Do the deed yourself.

384
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,723
I will.

385
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,098
And I won't
fuckin' forget this.

386
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,580
- Grace!
- He's dead.

387
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,051
What the hell happened?

388
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,577
Well, I was in the office
filling out report sheets.

389
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,216
- I never heard him code.
- How do you not hear the code?

390
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,282
Well I was busy.

391
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,090
Well now you're not.
You're fired.

392
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:08,028
Carlos Martinez is dead.

393
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,268
God damn it.

394
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,175
He died because we,
you and me,

395
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,441
didn't send him to a real
hospital for proper care

396
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,710
- and now he's dead.
- Gloria.

397
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,977
I have to do an autopsy,

398
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,077
and this time I am not lying.

399
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,248
I'm not covering anything up.
Full disclosure.

400
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,316
Did you hear me?
Full fucking disclosure!

401
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,122
Aw, shit.

402
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,970
I'm still not sure this is the best solution to
the problem.

403
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,501
Once the state medical board
reviews Nathan's findings

404
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,514
the truth will
come out anyway.

405
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,314
But shouldn't you just wait
until the autopsy's done?

406
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,751
He who creates the news

407
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,187
has the best chance
of controlling it.

408
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,182
Here's to full disclosure.

409
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,299
Thank you for coming.

410
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,064
We have discovered
that toxic chemical elements

411
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,664
residing in the air ducts
throughout solitary confinement

412
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,642
have infected three inmates.

413
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,545
And sadly, yesterday it lead
to the death of one of them,

414
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,946
Carlos Martinez.

415
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,686
I take full responsibility
for Martinez's death.

416
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,488
Good morning,
my beloveds.

417
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,290
Got a newsflash for you...

418
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,162
Your pal Martinez
bought the farm.

419
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,326
Farm?
What farm?

420
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,666
He died, stupid.

421
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,797
- What'd he die from?
- I don't know.

422
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,364
But whatever he had,
you clucks have it too.

423
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,275
- Are you sure?
- That's the scuttlebutt.

424
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,903
Shit.

425
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,746
If I were you, I'd pay up
my insurance premiums.

426
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,013
Wait wait wait
wait wait, look.

427
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,215
But buying a farm is
a good thing, right?

428
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,224
I mean, why does
that have to mean dying?

429
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,659
Shut up, Omar.

430
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,925
No, look, now that
don't make no sense.

431
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,990
Sold the farm, lost the farm,
the farm burned down, but...

432
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,899
Shut up, Omar!

433
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,403
That don't make no
goddamn sense.

434
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,461
Hey, Sean.

435
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,234
Sean, I've been
looking for you.

436
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,867
Here I am. Want to get a beer
after work?

437
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,069
Yeah, and I'm buying

438
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,409
to celebrate the death
of that spic Martinez.

439
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,107
Yeah, I'm not
shedding any tears.

440
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,616
It's too bad he 10-7'd
before he ratted on Morales.

441
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,710
That's the beauty part,
pal, he did.

442
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,846
You know I've been
visiting Martinez regular,

443
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,685
always at him to tell
me the truth?

444
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,714
Well he must have known
he was going to croak

445
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,193
and he wanted to make his peace
'cause last night he spilled.

446
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,628
- A deathbed confession?
- Yeah.

447
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,725
Martinez pinned the tail
on Morales' donkey ass.

448
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,362
You've known since last night,
didn't say anything till now?

449
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,338
That's why
I'm looking for you.

450
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,500
I want Morales
in solitary ASAP.

451
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,407
All right, come on.

452
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,320
Take the cuffs off.

453
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,159
What the fuck
do you want?

454
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,529
- What is this?
- Halftime entertainment.

455
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,029
Yo, Penders.

456
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,699
You think Morales is gonna
get his farm foreclosed?

457
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,312
Martinez cut me
right here.

458
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,213
Ruined my chances of
ever playing pro ball,

459
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,443
and I have this limp.

460
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:43,113
So you see, Enrique,
if I only cut the one

461
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,917
you'll limp like I do.

462
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:49,154
But if I cut them both,
you'll walk fine.

463
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,855
I see the devil.
I see the devil everywhere.

464
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,952
And you say this started when?

465
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,929
The moment Kirk died.

466
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,865
It's as if whatever
possessed him came into me.

467
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,300
I'm going to ask Sister Peter Marie

468
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,633
to schedule a session with you.

469
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,606
I'm not crazy, Father.
I see the devil...

470
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,474
right over your shoulder.

471
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,358
It sounds like he's going for an insanity
defense in his appeal.

472
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:01,024
No, he keeps saying,
"I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy."

473
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,831
Don't get me wrong, I think
he's crazy, but he doesn't.

474
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,064
I'm not sure that he
hasn't always been crazy.

475
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,471
Therefore, I'm not sure
that he should be executed.

476
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,202
Would you
talk to Hoyt?

477
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,904
Certainly.
But I have to ask,

478
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,209
what are you hoping
to get out of this?

479
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,579
- Me personally? Nothing.
- Yeah.

480
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,243
Wait a minute.

481
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,085
Are you trying to assuage
your guilt by helping Hoyt?

482
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:28,183
You told me yourself that you
prayed for Timmy Kirk to die.

483
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:32,322
Yes, but I know God doesn't
answer those kinds of prayers,

484
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,126
that Hoyt acted
on his own volition

485
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,326
and that I had nothing
to do with Kirk's demise.

486
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,234
And yet down deep you're
happy that the boy is dead.

487
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,867
Like I said, you're trying
to burn off excess guilt

488
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,467
by making Hoyt into a cause.

489
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,947
Just be sure he is
the proper recipient.

490
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,812
What do you mean?

491
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,148
Jaz Hoyt is not
the victim here.

492
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,192
You can walk away,

493
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,961
but I'm not like
the Reverend Cloutier.

494
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,265
I won't just disappear.

495
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,066
- Mrs. Kirk?
- Yes.

496
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,595
I'm Father Mukada.

497
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,938
I have Timothy's
belongings.

498
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,534
I just need you
to sign this form.

499
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,117
Did you know
my son?

500
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,812
Uh, yes.

501
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,230
Such a sweet
sweet face.

502
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,894
Who knew there was
so much bad inside?

503
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,598
He left his own baby
to die in a dumpster.

504
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,631
Then he came here.

505
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,239
He said such
terrible things,

506
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,842
shocking things...

507
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,580
about the church,
about Jesus.

508
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,356
He called me
Satan's whore.

509
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,859
Father, would you
hear my confession?

510
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,366
What could you possibly
have to confess?

511
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:30,405
I stopped loving
my son that day.

512
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,678
My heart went cold,

513
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,515
and I stopped loving him.

514
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:40,255
I need God to forgive
me for that.

515
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,470
"Music expresses that which
cannot be put into words,

516
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,408
and that which cannot
remain silent."

517
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,968
Victor Hugo.

518
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,476
Hello, Cyril.

519
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,452
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

520
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,986
I've been wondering...

521
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,619
Wait, Sister, don't you want
to say hello to me?

522
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,061
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hello, Jericho.

523
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,689
Cyril,

524
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,759
how are you
feeling lately?

525
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,702
He's fine.

526
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,368
Okay, that's enough.

527
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,900
Let's put Jericho
away, okay?

528
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,346
No.

529
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,477
Yes.

530
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,316
Give me the puppet.

531
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,056
Fuck... you...

532
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,619
you... cunt.

533
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,599
Cyril,

534
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,431
I gave you Jericho,

535
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,700
and now I want
him back.

536
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,744
Okay, now let go.
Let go.

537
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,411
Ow ow ow ow!

538
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,682
Officer!

539
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,246
- I need help.
- Let her go!

540
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,281
Jericho made me do it!

541
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,555
Jericho made me do it!

542
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,893
Get off me!

543
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,491
- Give me that thing!
- Take this goddamn thing!

544
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,195
Get up.

545
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,734
Jericho.

546
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,544
Jericho.

547
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,651
Jericho!

548
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,685
Jericho!
Jericho.

549
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,626
O'Reily, shut the fuck up.

550
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,596
Jericho.

551
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,689
Sobbing like a chick
over a stupid puppet?

552
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,927
Jericho.

553
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,528
Knock it off right now,
or else.

554
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,471
Jericho Jericho.

555
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,303
Okay, I warned you.

556
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,936
- Matt!
- Jericho.

557
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,105
- Jericho.
- What the fuck?

558
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,815
Jericho.

559
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,443
Douse the little prick.

560
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,115
Stop stop!

561
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,998
Stop!

562
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,232
You want some of this too?

563
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,602
Stop!

564
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,405
Lights out!

565
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,150
If the appeals court
plays ball,

566
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,286
Cyril O'Reily
will die next month.

567
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,126
The first person executed
under the state's new definition

568
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,395
of mentally retarded.

569
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,027
We have to be prepared
for a backlash.

570
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,060
Yes, Reimondo and her
happy band of do-gooders

571
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,767
have been stirring up
the press and the public.

572
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,365
The question is,
how do we fight back?

573
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,343
There wouldn't be all
this breast-beating

574
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,972
if folks thought
the 'tard was normal.

575
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,472
So, we have
to make him normal,

576
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,418
or appear normal.

577
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,546
According to Sister
Peter Marie's files,

578
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,853
Cyril has been given a series
of stabilizing drugs,

579
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,381
none of which
has been successful.

580
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,224
Which is why
I propose using E.C.T.

581
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,890
What's E.C. T?

582
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,527
Basically the PC way
of saying electroshock.

583
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,059
Governor...

584
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,697
There's a nasty misconception
about E.C.T.

585
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,539
It's not the horrible mind
torture you see in the movies.

586
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,374
It's really quite benign.

587
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,243
Look, I'm not gonna sit here

588
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,908
debating the pros and cons
of electroshock therapy.

589
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,145
Cyril is Sister
Peter Marie's patient.

590
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,710
A decision can't be made
without consulting her.

591
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,587
Dr. Donald Rofe, Director of
the State Office of Mental Health

592
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,091
will meet with her tomorrow.

593
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,151
You'll also need permission
from the O'Reily family.

594
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,493
Signed by the father,
Seamus O'Reily.

595
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,603
You agree with all of this?

596
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,265
It was my idea.

597
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,280
Peter Marie,
you okay?

598
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,157
Uh...

599
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,956
No.

600
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,587
I just had a meeting
with Don Rofe

601
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,591
who told me that they're going
to give Cyril O'Reily E.C.T.

602
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,433
And...

603
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:57,407
that I'd better shut up
and like it.

604
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,409
Will you?

605
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,580
Well...

606
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,139
that's what I'm
trying to decide.

607
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,913
You know, normally
in situations like this,

608
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,921
I just raise high
the battlements

609
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,482
and charge.

610
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,494
But as uh...

611
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,759
Rofe so eloquently
pointed out,

612
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,322
in Cyril's case...

613
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,671
I have failed completely.

614
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,577
Nothing I tried
has worked.

615
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,343
So, I have to weigh my ego

616
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,512
against what's best
for my patient.

617
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,982
I don't want to say no

618
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,687
just to keep somebody
else from...

619
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,131
succeeding where I
have failed.

620
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,466
And you think a spin around
McManus' maze will do the trick?

621
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,404
Can't hurt.

622
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,826
Hey, you wanted
to see me?

623
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,691
Yeah, Ryan, sit down.

624
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,720
That's good, because
I wanted to see you too.

625
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,198
I just saw Cyril,
and he's so goddamn sad.

626
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,791
If his puppet
means so much to him,

627
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,826
why don't you just
give it back to him?

628
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,532
I can't, Ryan.

629
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,906
Jericho was my idea,
remember?

630
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,208
A way for Cyril to deal with
the confusion surrounding the trial,

631
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,647
but unfortunately the puppet
has come to mean

632
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,674
more than that to him.

633
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,347
It's become a whole
other personality.

634
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,584
I don't care about that.

635
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,285
I just want Cyril
to be happy.

636
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,726
It's not that simple.

637
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:01,129
Cyril is suffering from severe
depression and schizophrenia.

638
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,532
All right, so what's next?

639
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,729
I mean, what can
we do to cure him?

640
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,375
Your father has already agreed
to electroshock therapy.

641
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,967
My father?

642
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,877
What the fuck does that old
bastard have to do with anything?

643
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,314
I know, it's unbelievable,
but in the eyes of the law

644
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,682
he is Cyril's guardian.

645
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,381
All right, so this
electroshock therapy,

646
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,481
does it do any good?

647
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,458
I have no experience
with it.

648
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,689
The treatment was in vogue
for years and fell out of favor.

649
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,165
However, some mental health
professionals swear by it.

650
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,293
Clinical evidence indicates
that E.C.T.

651
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,567
Produces a substantial
improvement in 80% of patients.

652
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,074
Are there any dangers?

653
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,077
There's headaches,

654
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,341
there's soreness,

655
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,245
nausea, memory loss.

656
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,250
Look...

657
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,411
we're talking
120 volts...

658
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,921
an ordinary
household current

659
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,583
applied to the brain
for half a second,

660
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,491
10 to 15 times within a period
of two to three weeks.

661
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,519
And no one knows if there's
permanent damage.

662
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,794
No.

663
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,994
Jesus Christ,
can't we stop them?

664
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,267
The truth is that they have
conspired to make this happen.

665
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,332
We are taken out of
this decision-making.

666
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,605
I spoke to Zelman to see
if we could go to court,

667
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,771
if we could fight it,
and he says we wouldn't win.

668
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,805
That's genius.

669
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,683
Devlin wants
to electroshock Cyril

670
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,916
to make him normal enough
to electrocute him.

671
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,568
"Music is the brandy
of the damned."

672
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,196
George Bernard Shaw.

673
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,069
Hello, Cyril.

674
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,267
Why don't you hop
right up here?

675
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,675
Trust me, this one's going
to be a piece of cake.

676
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,680
We're going to give you
two different drugs,

677
00:41:56,714 --> 00:42:00,878
one that puts you to sleep,
the other relaxes your muscles.

678
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,943
This is gonna prick a bit.

679
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,251
These are electrodes,
and once you're asleep

680
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,087
they'll measure the current
that's stimulating your brain.

681
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,423
We're going to do
a little procedure today.

682
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,554
Now, this is going
to prick just a bit.

683
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,402
Relax.
Relax.

684
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,371
This will put you to sleep.

685
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,575
- Does it hurt?
- Not if you're asleep.

686
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,580
He's out.

687
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,558
- Ready?
- Fire away.

688
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,848
How are you feeling?

689
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,649
I have a terrible
headache.

690
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,552
Did you tell your doctors?

691
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,458
Who?

692
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,621
Never mind.

693
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,860
Sometimes if somebody
holds you

694
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,564
the pain goes away.

695
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,130
Do you want me
to hold you?

696
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,642
Okay.

697
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,146
Come on, sweetie.

698
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,997
- Hello, Ryan.
- Hi.

699
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,632
I, uh, just...

700
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,973
had a call
from Arnold Zelman.

701
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,036
They've denied
Cyril's appeal.

702
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,245
Shit.

703
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,611
Okay.

704
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,554
Okay, now
what do we do?

705
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,648
Well, Zelman will probably
try to figure out

706
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,593
another approach,
another appeal,

707
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,153
but in the meantime
the judge has set the date

708
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,631
for Cyril's execution.

709
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,765
What?

710
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,602
- When?
- Three weeks from Thursday.

711
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,739
That's not much time.

712
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,250
I feel deep down
we'll stop the execution,

713
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:24,186
but just in case, Ryan,

714
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,315
- you ought to accept the fact...
- No.

715
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,655
No way.

716
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,820
You know, if I even
entertain the thought,

717
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,593
if I let myself believe for a second that my
brother's gonna die,

718
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,863
then my brother's gonna die.

719
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,871
This was Father Meehan's.

720
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,873
I don't know,

721
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,273
I have faith, Sister.

722
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,904
For the first time
in a really long time

723
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,436
I have faith.

724
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,821
I still don't understand

725
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,619
why we gave up
running the cafeteria.

726
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,217
We got us some new jobs.

727
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,956
Man, kitchen best
detail there is.

728
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,827
I got the belly
to prove it.

729
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,765
Yeah, well I found us
something better,

730
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,166
something that will get us
out of the muck and mire.

731
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,794
Man, we ain't down
in no shit.

732
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,771
Wrong, Kenaniah.
We in so much shit,

733
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,501
you can't even smell it
no more.

734
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,772
- So what's your brainstorm?
- Gonna be telemarketers.

735
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,979
- Tele who?
- I'm serious.

736
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,041
Gonna learn you boys
some skills,

737
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,643
something that'll make you
more cash

738
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,278
than you're making
in the kitchen.

739
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,119
- Not more than slinging.
- Ain't gonna be no more slinging.

740
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,888
- Are you crazy, nigger?
- Yeah, no motherfuckin' way...

741
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,919
Hold up, hold up.
So what's your angle, Burr?

742
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,295
There ain't no angle.

743
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:45,062
This is the dawn
of a new day, gentlemen.

744
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,799
Our charge is to rise up
and face it.

745
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,137
And rise up we shall.

746
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,543
And this is the nerve center

747
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,679
of our operation.

748
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,315
It's very nice.
Very nice.

749
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,621
And it runs like any other
telemarketing firm?

750
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,152
Better. I hire these guys
cheap, you get me cheaper,

751
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,892
which in turn lowers
your overhead,

752
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,095
increases call volume and fills
those campaign coffers.

753
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,160
And the day-to-day,
no difference?

754
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,264
S.O.P. You provide us with contact
numbers and prepared text,

755
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,831
we get right to work.

756
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,036
And nobody knows
they're talking to convicts?

757
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,375
Not unless you want us
to tell them.

758
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,246
Trust me, that would be
the last thing that Senator Laken

759
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,977
would want
his constituents to know.

760
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:38,716
Laken? The right-wing,
Bible-toting motherfucker?

761
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,382
His legislation
is the main reason

762
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:43,120
why half the men in here
are doing twice as much time.

763
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,128
Let me assure you,
Mr. D'Arta,

764
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,221
that my company
is non-partisan

765
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:50,324
and will be committed to
whatever it is you want us to do.

766
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,699
Can the editorials!

767
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,432
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't
mean any offense.

768
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,963
That's all right.

769
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,704
Everyone is entitled
to their own point of view.

770
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:03,076
This is America,
after all.

771
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,877
And this program is working
in other prisons?

772
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,884
It's thriving.

773
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,046
A situation like this benefits everybody.
Nobody loses.

774
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,716
I'm a campaign manager,
Ms. Degenhart.

775
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,725
Somebody always loses.

776
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,954
But I will take your proposal
back to my people.

777
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,225
Great.

778
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,533
Don't let me go real-a,
gorilla, bad nigger driller;

779
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,306
Double live, cross-eyed,
see-you-from-the-side schemer;

780
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,438
Type of nigger bang
his chest when he fight,

781
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:38,709
for he's in too much truth,

782
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,979
so, we see the blessings of
night, blessings of calm.

783
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,486
Nothing lays waiting. Imagine
what he's holdin' in his palm;

784
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,680
Holding in his dream,

785
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,019
500 years of hate
just building like steam;

786
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,752
Mounting like Kilimanjaro.

787
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,226
So just wait until tomorrow
when things get right with me.

788
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,526
I'm gonna smite the wicked,
step off easy.

789
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,130
Burr, Burr, what's up,
what's up?

790
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,034
We're in business,
gentlemen.

791
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,801
Contract got signed today.

792
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,298
Why that put you in such
a fine fuckin' mood?

793
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,245
They ain't turning us
into working stiffs, man.

794
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,874
Poet, that attitude is the first
thing you gonna get rid of.

795
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,146
I ain't doin' it.

796
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,653
Funny how you think
you got a choice.

797
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,623
So we giving up the tit
trade just like that?

798
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:24,149
If I am, you are too.

799
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,960
You don't have to worry about
getting on board right away.

800
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,023
Just be ready by 9:00
tomorrow morning.

801
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,126
C'mon Burr.
God damn, man.

802
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,161
And you don't have to believe
that I'm right,

803
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,901
because I'm going to show you
how right I am.

804
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,147
So, when do you expect to
publish Augustus Hill's book?

805
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,084
We were hoping
to have it out this month,

806
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,644
but that's why
we needed to see you.

807
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,747
There's been a bump over
who owns the rights.

808
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,248
Augustus had a will, clearly stating
all monies from the book

809
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:00,229
went to groups that help prisoners,
like The Fortune Society.

810
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,128
Yes, but his wife,
Anabella...

811
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,292
Ex-wife.
She divorced him.

812
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,895
She is claiming the divorce was not final at
the time of Hill's death

813
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,668
and that she is the rightful heir
to his royalties.

814
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,005
Plus we've been served
an injunction

815
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,476
by the family
of Lawrence Hudack.

816
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,570
The officer
that Augustus killed?

817
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,241
This state has a Son of Sam Law.
All the money from the book

818
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,750
is supposed to go
into a victim's trust.

819
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:26,744
Kareem, we are looking
at months,

820
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,759
maybe years of legal battles.

821
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,120
What are you saying to me?

822
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,394
You're not gonna publish
this book?

823
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,731
The publishing industry's
shaky right now.

824
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,533
And this memoir,
although well written,

825
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,540
it's not a bestseller.

826
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,578
What if I could make it
worth your while,

827
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,480
cut your printing costs?

828
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,917
How are you gonna do that?

829
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,854
I had an inspiration.

830
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,895
Now just wait a minute,
wait a minute, back up.

831
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,523
You want to start
your own company?

832
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,795
Yes, bookbinding.

833
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,062
I've done the research.

834
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,127
Perfect size business
to run from Oz.

835
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,832
I presume you're not looking
to the state

836
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,601
for money to start
this little venture.

837
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,132
No, we Muslims will pool
our bank accounts.

838
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,340
It's a small risk.
My publishers have agreed

839
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,109
to let me produce
Augustus' book for them.

840
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,139
They've introduced me
to potential clients.

841
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,381
I thought you were against
the concept of prison labor.

842
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,787
Not the concept,
the way it's practiced.

843
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,292
I'm not gonna drive some local
competitor out of business,

844
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,159
in that I do not have
any local competitors.

845
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,426
And more importantly,
McManus,

846
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,330
I will pay
the decent wage,

847
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,129
minimum wage.

848
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:49,571
You're going to fork $5.25 an hour
out of your own pocket?!

849
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,006
In the beginning, yes.
But with projected earnings

850
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,705
I expect we'll be making it
back within six weeks.

851
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:59,442
Well, I can't think of
a good reason to say no.

852
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,418
You?

853
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,250
You know, we keep developing
our own industries,

854
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,951
Oz is gonna end up on
the cover of "Fortune 500."

855
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,119
Look at this,
my brothers.

856
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,833
It's an ordinary book
to some.

857
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:23,098
And yet I believe what
I hold in my hand

858
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,041
is the past...

859
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,567
what has been written;

860
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,513
The present...

861
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,516
what can be read now;

862
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,313
And the future...

863
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,287
the glorious work
before us.

864
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,082
And we Muslims, we're going
to lead the way

865
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,093
for the world to see
how workers

866
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,118
can be treated fairly,

867
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,064
can be treated respectfully.

868
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,535
We will demonstrate
true pride in our craft

869
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,538
and we will demonstrate,
once and forever,

870
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:59,133
how human beings pulling
together can become a force

871
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,144
for good

872
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,045
and celebrated
in the spirit of Allah.

873
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,149
Now, I'm asking
for your help.

874
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,746
I'm asking
for your dedication.

875
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:16,191
I am asking for your
absolute commitment.

876
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,854
- Are you with me?
- Yes!

877
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,920
I can't hear you,
are you with me?

878
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,159
- Yes!
- Allahu akbar.

879
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,031
- Allahu akbar!
- Allahu akbar!

880
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,263
- Allahu akbar!
- Allahu akbar!

881
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,795
Allahu akbar!

882
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,774
All praise is due
to Allah.

883
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,771
The course you've set
will be difficult, Minister.

884
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,610
Yes, but worth
the struggle.

885
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,082
Being a part of publishing
Augustus' book,

886
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:44,018
the entire population of Oz
will be rejuvenated.

887
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,181
Now, I've contacted
Anabella Hill

888
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,021
and the Hudack family.

889
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,118
I'm trying to settle
their legal claims.

890
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,425
Who's that?

891
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,953
He's a reporter.

892
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,296
He's gonna do a story
on our new venture.

893
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,700
- Wait here.
- All right.

894
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,601
Kareem Said.

895
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,872
Mr. Idzik.

896
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,662
Arif...

897
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,569
don't harm him.

898
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,473
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

899
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,811
You're gonna be all right.
Come on, come on.

900
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,249
Breathe breathe.

901
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,379
Breathe, please.
Please...

902
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,361
William Congreve said,

903
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,957
"Music has charms to soothe
the savage breast,

904
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:06,958
to soften rocks or bend
a knotted oak."

905
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,563
But what happens
when the music is gone?

906
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:12,074
When there is no melody?

907
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,440
When all you hear...

908
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,105
is silence?

909
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,945
The bittersweet
deafening sound of nothing.

910
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,212
Nothing at all.
