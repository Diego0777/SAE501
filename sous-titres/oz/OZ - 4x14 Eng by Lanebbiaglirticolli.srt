1
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,469
Back in the old Greek times

2
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,412
there lived a man
named Orpheus.

3
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,039
Loved his wife.

4
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,107
Took it easy on the ouzo.

5
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,085
Played a mean guitar.

6
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,916
Upstanding guy.

7
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,582
So what did
the almighty gods do?

8
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:53,616
They fucked with him,
made his life Hades.

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,151
Why? Because that's what
those in power do

10
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:58,061
to those of us with none.

11
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:22,285
The time for action
has arrived.

12
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:26,019
Tug, you waste Pancamo.

13
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,496
We don't like Burr Redding
any more than you.

14
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,594
You want him dead,
we want him dead.

15
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:42,472
l want Morales.

16
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:12,698
l was in the hospital
10 days.

17
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,470
l'd like to think that's when this
little brouhaha began,

18
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,776
but l have an inkling
it's been brewing a lot longer.

19
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:24,682
At any rate, we narrowly missed
a major war with significant carnage.

20
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:27,881
The question then becomes:

21
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,718
what happens now?

22
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:32,281
Now l'm gonna give
you gentlemen a couple of options.

23
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,589
l could stick you both
in that cage

24
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,528
where you can maul
each other

25
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:39,259
until one of you's dead
and the other on death row.

26
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,427
l could transfer you both
to different units,

27
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:45,734
where you could still kill each other,
but not on my watch.

28
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:50,037
Or we can come
to some kind of truce.

29
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:52,067
What do you say?

30
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,681
Peace.

31
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,325
lt's a beautiful thing.

32
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:12,160
Yeah. Shake hands
where everybody can see you.

33
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,924
Burr. Burr. Burr.

34
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,791
- You keep away from me.
- Wait a minute, man.

35
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,091
l know it was you
who tipped off them hacks.

36
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,097
You betrayed me.

37
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,793
Me, who raised you
like you was my own.

38
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:51,531
lf you was anybody else
you would be dead now.

39
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,096
But l'm gonna let you live.

40
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,338
Live with the shame
of what you done.

41
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:01,108
Only you and me is through.

42
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,712
Whoa.
Step back, Chinaman.

43
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,483
Don't push your luck
with me, Guerra.

44
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,685
And just 'cause you
and Redding made nice-nice

45
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:15,559
doesn't mean l'm not gonna whack
your taco-eating ass.

46
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,893
l said step back.

47
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,455
Jesus, man!

48
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:21,228
You're not out of the pod
10 minutes,

49
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,031
you're already causing trouble.
ln the fucking cage.

50
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,656
Supreme Allah.

51
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,491
l heard you were dead.

52
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,520
Now that's funny.

53
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,532
l heard the same thing
about you.

54
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,126
Guess you can't believe
rumors.

55
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,138
Like the one that says you fools
signed a treaty with Burr Redding.

56
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,868
- What would you have done?
- Tell you what l will do.

57
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,876
That nigger's going down.

58
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,640
We've been trying to airhole
that motherfucker since he got here.

59
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,341
No success.

60
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:12,044
Besides, if he dies now,
the hacks will be after us.

61
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,780
Not if he gets greased
by one of his own.

62
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,117
Who have you got
in mind?

63
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:18,181
Him.

64
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,595
Augustus,

65
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,129
how come you ain't chowing
with your old pal Redding?

66
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,007
Take a fucking walk,
Ketchup.

67
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:40,376
You know Omar White?

68
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,472
He tried to kill me.

69
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:45,951
Tug Daniels,
he tried too.

70
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,613
But l'm still
on my hind legs.

71
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,850
Now that you're on the outs
with old Burr,

72
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,448
you need a friend.

73
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,619
Yeah, well that ain't you,
nigger.

74
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,822
Look, l want to make right
what l done to you,

75
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,627
putting you in this chair,
putting you in Oz.

76
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,635
So remember,

77
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,103
from now on

78
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,766
l got your back covered.

79
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,914
Redding, meet your new cell-mate,
the colonel.

80
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:18,179
l don't want a cell-mate.

81
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:21,881
Your reservation for the single suite
must have got screwed up.

82
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,481
What the hell is McManus
thinking anyway,

83
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:28,756
putting me and you
in here together?

84
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,786
l don't know.

85
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,458
Why did he call you
the colonel?

86
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:39,495
Because that's what l am.

87
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,241
You're a marine.

88
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,039
Affirmative.

89
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:47,740
l was in the army myself,

90
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,807
4th armored cav,
1st infantry division,

91
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,751
Vietnam.

92
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,255
l was in Vietnam,

93
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,849
3rd battalion,
4th marines.

94
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:03,556
McManus might not be
as stupid as l thought he was.

95
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,204
Make yourself at home.

96
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:19,572
Colonel,

97
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:23,013
l just might have
a little mission for you.

98
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:26,712
A search and destroy.

99
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,953
Physically Omar White's
fully recovered.

100
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,428
l was planning to send
him back to solitary today.

101
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,829
- Pete, you had a session with him?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,926
He's a volatile young man,
but much of that is fueled by drugs.

103
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,564
So if we can keep
Omar White clean, then he's salvageable?

104
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,871
- Tim, what are you--
- l'm bringing him back to Em City.

105
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:52,810
Tim, he stabbed you.

106
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:55,815
That's all the more reason
for me to be the one to make the effort.

107
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,556
Hello, Omar.

108
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,794
Look, man, l-l'm sorry
for shanking you.

109
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:16,029
- l just don't know what comes over me.
- l forgive you.

110
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,299
You do?

111
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,136
How'd you like to come back
to Em City?

112
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,642
lnstead of solitary?

113
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,079
You don't have
to ask me twice, you know.

114
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,913
Well, l can make
that happen,

115
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,078
but we gotta go over
some ground rules.

116
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:39,048
Yo, man, so how you
get out of solitary?

117
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,582
McManus.

118
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,458
He forgave me.

119
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,487
- That motherfucker's on crack.
- Who you telling?

120
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:53,263
So Orpheus' wife's
strolling along,

121
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:56,036
gets bitten by a snake
and dies.

122
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:59,977
Orpheus freaks out
and heads down into the underworld

123
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,038
to demand that his lady
be returned.

124
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:06,279
Then some goddess says,
''Okay, on one condition.

125
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,415
lf you look at her before you get back
to Earth, she'll disappear.''

126
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,822
With, like, 10 feet to go,

127
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:15,123
motherfucker turns around,

128
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:18,096
and wifey's sent right back
to hell.

129
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,292
Orpheus should have
known better.

130
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,860
You don't fuck
with the gods.

131
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:28,363
That's what l told him,
Shirl, but you know how men are.

132
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,399
Yeah, about...

133
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,710
What, you want
something there, kid?

134
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:38,341
What kind of name
is Yood?

135
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:41,911
What do you mean, what kind of name?
lt's a last name.

136
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,583
- Jesus.
- Let's deal.

137
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,320
l meant, what kind
of nationality is Yood, you dumb ass!

138
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,852
- lt's American.
- There are no American names, dumb ass.

139
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:54,298
- Quit calling me that.
- Because there are no Americans.

140
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,325
Oh, here we go again.

141
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,803
We're all from someplace else
originally.

142
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:02,569
My name is American.

143
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,576
Your name is dumb ass!

144
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,509
Officer Howell.

145
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,310
- What?
- Do your job.

146
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:13,547
l'll call you back.
Clayton, are you starting shit again?

147
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,554
l'm just making
conversation.

148
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,682
Well, shut your trap!

149
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,819
Basil, you taking
Yood's side against mine?

150
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,559
Yeah, why shouldn't l?

151
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,157
'Cause of what he is
and what we are.

152
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:30,192
What you are
is a fuck wad.

153
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:53,187
Oh, Johnny.
God, l missed you so much.

154
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,626
l didn't know how much
till now.

155
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,686
Shh. Don't cry.

156
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,027
Let's sit down.

157
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:07,701
l want you
to come home.

158
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,402
- Sweetheart, come home.
- You know l can't.

159
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:13,241
As much as l want to,
not for at least three years.

160
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,907
- l won't make it three years.
- Yes, you will.

161
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,745
You'll have to.

162
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,877
For Robby's sake.

163
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,386
And for mine.

164
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:28,489
You being there waiting is the only
thing that keeps me whole, Abby.

165
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:32,328
And someday you, me and Robby,
we're gonna be together again.

166
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:35,334
And we're gonna laugh.

167
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,838
And we're gonna forget,
okay?

168
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,742
Next week l want you
to bring Robby.

169
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,147
l'm finally ready
to face my boy.

170
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,388
- Basil.
- Yeah?

171
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:39,624
Your son, you think he's gonna be okay
growing up without a father?

172
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,599
What?

173
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,034
Now who's the fuck wad?

174
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,502
You crazy son of a bitch!

175
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:56,213
What the hell is going on?
Open this fucking door now!

176
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,643
Open the door now,
you sons of bitches!

177
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,416
Open the fucking door!

178
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:00,076
l'm heading home.

179
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,670
l'll walk out with you.

180
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:03,375
- Ooh, l'll get that.
- Leave it.

181
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,850
- The stain might mess up--
- Leave it alone!

182
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,721
l want the broken glass
there in the morning

183
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,315
to remind me

184
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,690
of how drunk l am.

185
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,524
You can't drive
in this condition.

186
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,291
What's the worst
that could happen?

187
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,889
Wrap myself
around a tree?

188
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,797
l'll call you
a cab.

189
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,098
- No.
- Then l'll drive you myself.

190
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:31,471
John Basil and l had
a lot in common.

191
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,411
Good intentions

192
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:37,575
that turned to shit.

193
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,286
He warned me about Clayton.

194
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,348
l did nothing,

195
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:51,295
'cause there was nothing
l could do.

196
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,094
Come on.
Let me take you home.

197
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:13,078
Well, l just love snow
before Christmas,

198
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,555
and l could tolerate it
in January,

199
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:20,525
but come February,
snow is redundant.

200
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,991
Well, good morning
to you, too.

201
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,557
l'm sorry.
Good morning, Sister.

202
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,871
What's the matter?

203
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,498
l miss Keller.

204
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:39,436
We can't call each other,
and if he's written me back,

205
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:43,608
one of the Nazis in the mailroom
probably destroyed his letters.

206
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,447
Or maybe he hasn't written.

207
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,885
Maybe he's already found somebody else.
Maybe he's dead.

208
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:54,154
l'll contact the head of psychiatry
at Cedar Junction

209
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,854
and find out how
Keller's doing.

210
00:16:55,895 --> 00:17:00,059
l'll even try to arrange a phone
conversation between you two.

211
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,033
Well, that would
be great, Sister.

212
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,229
Because since he's
been gone l just--

213
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,795
l feel like, um--

214
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,469
l don't know, not dead,
not empty.

215
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,570
You know, Tobias,
you have a lot to be happy about.

216
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,241
Your daughter's finally beginning
to respond normally,

217
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:20,446
Katherine McClain is setting up
your parole hearing.

218
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:23,046
That's part of all this weirdness
inside me.

219
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:28,750
lf l get out,
who will l be?

220
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,857
So l've walked Steve Dawkins
through your case.

221
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:35,366
l have to say,
l'm guardedly optimistic.

222
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:39,394
You actually think there's a chance
the parole board might let me out?

223
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,963
Yes.
Yes, l do.

224
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,599
Oh my God.

225
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,167
Katherine, that--
l can't thank you enough.

226
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:49,511
Don't thank me until
you're on the other side of the wall.

227
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,449
Okay, but if l do go free
l'm gonna take you out to dinner.

228
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:55,818
Nicest restaurant
in the city, Dom, everything.

229
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,119
Hmm.
l'd like that.

230
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,452
Are you married?

231
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,689
- l'm--
- You know what?

232
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,287
You don't have
to answer that.

233
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:07,390
What am l thinking,
asking you personal questions?

234
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,401
- You're my lawyer, for Christ's sake.
- Stop.

235
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,268
lt's okay. l know every detail
of your personal life,

236
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,431
why shouldn't you
know something about mine?

237
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,399
l'm divorced.

238
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,536
Any kids?

239
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:22,513
One. A son.
He's eight.

240
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,982
That's the same age
as Holly.

241
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,679
- l know.
- Oh, yeah.

242
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,245
Right.

243
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,053
Party's over.
Let's go.

244
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,720
That's the problem
here in Oz.

245
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,888
You never get to finish
a conversation.

246
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,921
We're far from finished,
Tobias.

247
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,702
Okay, here he is.

248
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:49,503
- Hello?
- Chris? This is Sister Pete.

249
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,510
- l'm with Tobias
- Hey.

250
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,536
- Hey.
- Warden Glynn and the fellow

251
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,811
who runs Cedar Junction have agreed
to this phone call on the condition

252
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,545
that l stay in the room here

253
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,576
and that someone stay
with you there.

254
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,420
So l-l'm afraid that this
won't be as, um,

255
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,655
intimate as you might like.

256
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,855
Thanks, Sister.

257
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:12,887
Toby, how are you?

258
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:16,527
Better now. You?

259
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,537
Hey, me,
you know,

260
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,267
making new friends,
surveying the lay of the land.

261
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:24,105
Chris, l might be
getting paroled.

262
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,168
- No shit.
- Yeah.

263
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,873
Maybe as soon
as a couple weeks.

264
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:31,212
l thought if l do, l'm gonna make
the trip up to Massachusetts.

265
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,016
Hey, Toby, don't.

266
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,988
lf you are lucky
enough to get out,

267
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,388
l want you to turn your back
on this shit and run.

268
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:43,657
You understand?
You gotta fucking run for your life.

269
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,721
- You giving me an order?
- No.

270
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:49,791
Man, l'm on my knees and l'm begging
you, stay away from me.

271
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:51,666
- l'm hanging up now.
- Chris.

272
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,809
Thank you.
Here we are.

273
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:44,015
Let me hold her.

274
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,456
l never got the chance
to hold her when she was born.

275
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:49,518
- You got it?
- Yeah, l got her.

276
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,998
Okay, say hello
to grandpa, Jewel.

277
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,364
You named her Jewel?

278
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,392
Well, she is one,
isn't she?

279
00:20:57,436 --> 00:21:00,963
And Hank loved
''You Were Meant for Me.''

280
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:03,975
Jewel Schillinger.

281
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,136
Jewel.

282
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:15,818
Yeah, Vern,
she's real cute.

283
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,958
Her name's Jewel.

284
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:22,961
Jewel?

285
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:26,624
Sure as hell hope the other kids
don't nickname her Jew.

286
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,566
Yo, you Salinger?

287
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,039
Schillinger.

288
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:37,042
All right.

289
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,703
l knew your son Hank.

290
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:42,612
- You knew my son?
- l heard you're a fucking pimp.

291
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,479
And proud of it.

292
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,950
My girls are the finest
on the strip.

293
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,887
- And my son?
- Short on some cash,

294
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,322
wanted to rent out
his girlfriend.

295
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:55,054
- All right, look--
- Casey, Carrie, something like that.

296
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:58,063
- Cute little blonde.
- You fucking liar!

297
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:01,191
Wait a minute, chief.
l don't want no trouble.

298
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,896
But, fuck, l thought you knew Hank
pimped that bitch.

299
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:07,132
Even a couple
of the brothers hit it.

300
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:10,403
l'm surprised
that baby ain't come out golden brown.

301
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,047
There is the possibility
that Curtis Bennett is lying.

302
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,055
Well, how do l find out
the truth?

303
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:26,319
Have you discussed
this with Carrie?

304
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:29,452
No, l can't see her again until
l get visiting privileges next week.

305
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:33,431
She has been talking
to Sarah over at my church.

306
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:36,798
l'll ask Sarah if the girl
said anything about her past.

307
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:40,362
ln the meantime,
be patient.

308
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:41,998
Patient!

309
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,407
Reverend, this thing is gonna
gnaw on me non-stop.

310
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,708
l need to know if this baby
is really my grandchild,

311
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:50,271
really my blood.

312
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,718
Why are you still
talking to Cloutier?

313
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,516
l gotta find out if Bennett's telling
the truth about Carrie.

314
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:58,716
- And if the nigger's lying?
- Oh, he's dead.

315
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:01,817
l'll stick him myself,
right between his banjo eyes.

316
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:07,830
James Robson hired Leroy Tidd
to assassinate me,

317
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:10,835
but when Leroy
converted to lslam,

318
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,997
he became Salah Yudin.

319
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,940
Robson had to hire
Carl Jenkins to finish the job.

320
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:26,407
He died saving me.

321
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:28,283
And Jenkins is on trial
for the murder.

322
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,788
But not Robson.

323
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:33,257
There's only one person
that can corroborate your theory,

324
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:36,227
that's Jenkins.
He ain't gonna squeal on a fellow Nazi.

325
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,286
l know how to turn
Jenkins around.

326
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,060
You let me speak
to the boy.

327
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,126
No. You face to face
with Jenkins

328
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,228
will only set off another race war.
l pass.

329
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:49,297
Glynn, you just do
what you always do--

330
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,309
nothing.

331
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,916
May we speak alone?

332
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,087
What's on your mind?

333
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,461
l've been watching you.

334
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,556
l believe you
to be a man of God,

335
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,569
true to your faith.

336
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,537
That you believe
in justice.

337
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:21,334
l do.

338
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:24,504
Then l have a favor
to ask.

339
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:43,822
You here to kill me?

340
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,853
No.

341
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:49,833
To help.

342
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,733
To save your soul.

343
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,431
Jenkins gave you up.

344
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,565
He pinned Leroy Tidd's
murder on you.

345
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:58,235
What did you do,
beat a confession out of him?

346
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,142
You're going down,
Robson.

347
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,307
- lt's his word against mine.
- You're gonna fry.

348
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:05,748
lt's his motherfucking,
cocksucking word against mine!

349
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,018
Thanks, Vern.

350
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:25,033
Carl.

351
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,039
This is for you.

352
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:30,371
From your friends
in the Brotherhood.

353
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,021
ls there a problem?

354
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,353
You been a comfort to me,
Reverend.

355
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,188
So l'm gonna
let you live.

356
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:23,660
But don't you ever

357
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:26,858
meddle in the affairs
of the Brotherhood again.

358
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,834
- Vern--
- ''And l will pour out

359
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,733
mine indignation upon thee.

360
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,797
l will blow against thee
in the fire of my wrath

361
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:37,900
and deliver thee into the hand

362
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:41,709
of brutish men and skillful to
destroy.''

363
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:59,664
Hey, what's up,
half-dick ?

364
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:02,030
- Fucking mick!
- Hey, hey!

365
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,830
Get in there.

366
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,030
There you go,
Alvarez.

367
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,766
You stupid fuck.

368
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:21,279
Hey, Smith.

369
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,982
- Yeah?
- Jenkins don't look so hot, man.

370
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:25,785
What do you mean?

371
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,328
Oh.

372
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:35,526
Guess he won't be eating
his chicken nuggets.

373
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,738
Oh, shit!

374
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,988
Oh shit!

375
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:00,390
Phelan!

376
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:04,691
You get on your phone
in there and call pest control!

377
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,857
l'm sick of sharing my cell with Mickey
and the other rats.

378
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,957
Mickey is a mouse.

379
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,832
l'm serious,
God damn it!

380
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,572
Your shot's off.

381
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:24,541
- Nothing wrong with my shot.
- No, it's off.

382
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,813
- There's no follow-through.
- Give me the ball.

383
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:29,685
Watch. See?
That's follow-through.

384
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:36,785
That's follow-through.

385
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:41,424
Come to think of it, your jumpshot
was erratic before you got to Oz.

386
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:44,264
Erratic my ass.
See that last game l played?

387
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:46,896
Shit, l busted
the Bulls for 55.

388
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:50,237
Yeah, if l remember right,
your team lost that night.

389
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,436
Well, l had
no supporting cast.

390
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:54,945
lt seemed to me
you were being too selfish.

391
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,811
You and every other
come-to-the-game-

392
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:58,679
live-your-dreams-
through-me motherfuckers.

393
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:00,207
Hey, l played.

394
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:03,380
l didn't have your gifts,
but my teams won.

395
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:07,381
White boy city league?
Not exactly the NBA.

396
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,019
Hey, winning's winning.

397
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,122
You either know how to win
or you don't.

398
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:16,032
lt's just in a guy.

399
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,593
So you're saying
if you and l played, you'd beat me?

400
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:20,332
Under the right circumstances,

401
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:22,306
ball bounces the right way,
who knows?

402
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,365
No circumstances
are you beating me.

403
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,934
Shit, l'd spot you
nine in a game of 10,

404
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:28,605
l'd beat you 10-9
every time.

405
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:31,013
l could take
the sorriest motherfucker in this prison

406
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,607
and you take the best,

407
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:37,418
and l'd still clown your broke-down,
pushing-50 junkyard ass.

408
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,583
Well, let's do it.

409
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:42,559
- Do what?
- You take the worst inmate,

410
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:46,621
l'll find the best CO
play a little two-on-two.

411
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:50,032
You're serious.

412
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:54,232
- As l stand here.
- You're gonna be pissed if l say no.

413
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,703
- l say no.
- Yeah? Fuck you.

414
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:01,075
lf you think about it,
it's really fuck you.

415
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:05,515
Hey! Hey!

416
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:10,448
You say yes,
l'll bring you back to Em City.

417
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,295
Basketball tournament?

418
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:22,425
More of an exhibition match.
Best of three games.

419
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,992
- Here we go again.
- What's that supposed to mean?

420
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,197
- What if something goes wrong?
- Nothing's gonna go wrong.

421
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:30,174
That's what you said about the boxing
and Hamid Khan died.

422
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,108
Basketball isn't boxing.

423
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,112
l'm more concerned
with crowd control.

424
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:37,206
The gym won't accommodate the amount
of prisoners we had attend the fights.

425
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:39,683
We limit the numbers.

426
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:42,016
Make good behavior
the price of admission.

427
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:44,920
All right.

428
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,947
That's all.

429
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:54,622
l need a teammate.

430
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:57,895
You're looking
at the wrong guy.

431
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:00,598
Oh, come on, Leo.
You love basketball.

432
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,631
l love basketball, but l'm not about
to go against Jackson Vahue.

433
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,667
- Leo, together l think we could--
- No, Tim.

434
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:10,545
Find another sap.
This one is staying on the sidelines.

435
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:18,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

436
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:21,225
l need you to play
with me in the game against Vahue.

437
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:24,194
Thanks, but you know,
l don't think so.

438
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,220
Hey, you're my guy.
l need you.

439
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:29,722
Tim, look, l--

440
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,963
l really think you should
call this game off.

441
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:34,096
- What?
- This is bad for us, man.

442
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,403
l mean, it ain't just you
out there.

443
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,068
All of us hacks
are gonna take

444
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,940
a tremendous amount of shit
when you lose.

445
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,572
Who knows?
We might win.

446
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:45,310
You're not gonna win.
You're gonna get your ass kicked!

447
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,648
lf l can get the space
to get my shot off,

448
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,347
l can score.

449
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,878
And you used to be
All-State in high school.

450
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:54,687
That was 20 years ago,
and you just got out of the hospital!

451
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:56,557
- l'm not playing.
- Oh, fine!

452
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:59,120
- Go fuck yourself!
- Jesus, Tim.

453
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,394
You know, you can be such
an asshole sometimes.

454
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:05,028
What's the matter? Timmy can't find
anybody to throw the ball to?

455
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:26,949
Dave!

456
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,825
Hey, looks like
you're a player.

457
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,625
You're good.

458
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:34,632
Oh, yeah.

459
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,692
All right.
You're better than good.

460
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,728
- Did you play in college?
- JUCO.

461
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,933
Had two good years
at a school upstate.

462
00:32:42,974 --> 00:32:45,943
You didn't go on
to a four-year program?

463
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:49,572
No, l did.
University of lowa.

464
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:51,946
But l had to drop out.

465
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:53,450
Ah, grades?

466
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,621
Yeah?

467
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:02,650
Got caught scalping my player comps
to football games.

468
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:05,390
Any minnie moo bullshit
l could think of.

469
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,024
Upside was l was never charged
for any of it.

470
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,830
Yeah, but the school was still forced
to run you off, huh?

471
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,429
Yeah. l guess
in my heart of hearts

472
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:16,167
l knew l wouldn't have
lasted there anyway.

473
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,869
Listen, uh,

474
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,402
l challenged Jackson Vahue
to some two-on-two.

475
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:25,348
- l heard.
- So you want to be my running mate?

476
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:28,318
- Go head to head with Vahue?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,878
That'd be a dream.

478
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:35,289
You wanted to see me?

479
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,625
- Busmalis, come in.
- Sit?

480
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:40,495
- Stand. You play basketball?
- No.

481
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:43,558
- How about when you were younger?
- No.

482
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,035
- Any sports at all?
- Nah.

483
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,039
l was the guy
with the towel.

484
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,473
Go introduce yourself
to Jackson Vahue.

485
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:52,669
You're his new teammate.

486
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,463
As you all know, this is the best
of a three-game series,

487
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,628
and due to the fact
that our court is

488
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,265
smaller than regulation size,
the games will run full court.

489
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:24,298
We'll set the clock,
20 minutes.

490
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,435
Each team will be given
one time-out,

491
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:29,413
and the three-point line
is in effect.

492
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:31,506
All right,
let's hoop it up.

493
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:29,232
Air ball! Air ball!

494
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:50,491
Vahue! Vahue! Vahue!

495
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,427
?? Na na na na
na na na na ??

496
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:03,635
?? Hey, hey, hey,
good bye... ??

497
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:11,305
The court has set
next Thursday

498
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,442
as the date
of your execution.

499
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,851
Have you decided
how you want to die?

500
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:19,345
l'm not like
my buddy Giles over there.

501
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,292
l'm not going for anything flashy
like being stoned to death.

502
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:26,229
Lethal injection will suit me
just fine, sir

503
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,095
- Good.
- l've contacted

504
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:30,862
the organ donor association

505
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:34,338
regarding your willingness
to donate your organs to people in need.

506
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,967
They were thrilled
by your generosity.

507
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,968
Plenty of folks are gonna
be thrilled to see me breathe my last.

508
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:44,481
The association
was resistant to having you meet

509
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:46,848
with those who would be
receiving your organs,

510
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:50,981
but after a little
gentle persuasion, they have agreed.

511
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,013
But only as long
as the patient does.

512
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:56,026
- Well, that's fair.
- One already has.

513
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,756
Tomorrow morning you meet
with one Jiffy Karas.

514
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:01,765
- Who's that?
- A blind man.

515
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:05,200
And your corneas will help
restore his sight.

516
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:11,241
Oh, don't get up.
l'm Jiffy Karas.

517
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:14,541
Don't ask why
my dad named me Jiffy.

518
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:22,352
- Moses Deyell.
- Ah, my hero.

519
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:25,288
Nobody's ever called me
a hero before.

520
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:27,518
Well, that's what
you are.

521
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,687
My children's children will
sing your praises.

522
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,958
You been blind
all your life?

523
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,658
No.

524
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,758
Lost my sight
two years ago.

525
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,133
But thanks to you,

526
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,469
l'll be able to see the faces
of my children again.

527
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:46,603
Well, l'm glad my death
could bring about some good.

528
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,977
Mr. Deyell, would you mind
if l touched you?

529
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,175
- Touch me?
- Your face.

530
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:55,014
l want to remember
exactly what you look like.

531
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:59,247
Yeah, sure.

532
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:11,402
All right, Deyell. We're shipping you
over to Benchley Memorial

533
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:14,337
so that the transplant
doctors there can do whatever tests

534
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:15,896
they need to do
before Thursday.

535
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,500
You'll also be
meeting a Deborah Beck,

536
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,511
a 20-year-old
social science major.

537
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:23,571
She'll be receiving
your heart.

538
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,085
You know what's
so crazy about this?

539
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,021
On the brink of my demise
l feel more alive than ever,

540
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,752
like l got more reason
to live.

541
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:38,421
- Take him out.
- So long, Said.

542
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,505
Funny,

543
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:55,671
he said so long
like he was never coming back.

544
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:03,576
You're gonna risk it all
and go for the $1 million?

545
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:05,282
Absolutely.
l feel lucky.

546
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:10,124
What is the capital city
of Burkina Faso?

547
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,254
Any idea?

548
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:14,924
Burkina Faso City?

549
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:17,059
Now, l need either a hint
or an answer.

550
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,898
What's the answer,
Beecher?

551
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,370
l do not have
a fucking clue.

552
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:24,000
l dated a girl
named Burkina Faso.

553
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,636
And the capital
of Upper Volta is Ouagagoudou.

554
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:29,670
- You're sure?
- l'm positive. Ouagagoudou.

555
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:34,378
l'm sorry, John.
The answer is Ouagadougou.

556
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:36,887
- Ouagagoudou is wrong.
- You've got to be kidding.

557
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:39,856
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special news bulletin.

558
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,485
WYAT has just received word

559
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:45,553
that convicted murderer
Moses Deyell has died

560
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,622
in an attempted escape while
being temporarily transferred

561
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:52,261
from the Oswald Correctional
Facility to Benchley Memorial Hospital.

562
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:56,171
Deyell, who had decided to donate his
organs immediately after his execution,

563
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,266
was being transported
in a van

564
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,743
when he apparently leapt
out of the moving vehicle.

565
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:04,043
We'll have more details
on this story as it develops.

566
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,576
So Orpheus returns
to Earth

567
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:39,015
alone, sad,
and what happens?

568
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,076
Do the townspeople console him?
Fuck no.

569
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,247
They blame him
for his failure

570
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,813
and tear him to bits,
literally.

571
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:49,156
Then they throw his organs
in the river.

572
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:51,787
All this 'cause
he let his family down,

573
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:55,128
'cause he took one last look
at someone he loved.

574
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:59,728
The gods don't have
a sentimental bone in their bodies.

575
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:09,236
Prisoner #01C972,

576
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,804
Padraig Connolly;

577
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:14,682
Arrested
February 28th, 2001 ;

578
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,187
lllegal entry
into the United States.

579
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:20,520
Being held
pending deportation.

580
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,355
Padraig Connolly
is here?

581
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:26,227
Came in this morning.
You knew about Connolly?

582
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:28,824
Yeah, from the papers.
Member of the lRA,

583
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:31,198
British government wants
to extradite him

584
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,795
for his involvement in the death
of a British soldier.

585
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:36,238
A few days ago the court ruled
in Connolly's favor,

586
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:37,468
they granted him asylum.

587
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:39,635
The lNS Appealed
the decision.

588
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:43,044
Connolly's been sent here
to wait out the legal battle.

589
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,742
- Why isn't he in a federal prison?
- He was.

590
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,250
He kept getting
death threats.

591
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:49,685
Almost got murdered
by a Protestant sympathizer,

592
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,517
so our friends at
the State Department

593
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,717
asked if we could hide
him in Oz.

594
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:56,852
- Put Connolly in Em City.
- Why?

595
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:58,327
Why not?

596
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:03,330
You just want him there
so you can study his every move.

597
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:05,835
Genuine terrorist.

598
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,804
l admit, l'm intrigued.

599
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,831
Okay, he's yours.

600
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,568
God help you both.

601
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:24,550
Padraig,
l'm Tim McManus.

602
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,284
l'm Unit Manager
of Em City.

603
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,154
Have a seat.

604
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,368
l've been following
your situation,

605
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,461
and so l know how
fucked up it is.

606
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:42,699
So l took the liberty
of calling your lawyer

607
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,264
and l got
some pretty good news.

608
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,674
lt doesn't seem like you're
gonna be here long.

609
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:49,839
Since you're litigating
to stay in the US

610
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,248
it's presumable you don't pose
any flight risk.

611
00:42:53,284 --> 00:42:57,015
So your lawyer feels
that with the judge already sympathetic

612
00:42:57,054 --> 00:43:00,546
to your cause, along with the support
of human rights groups,

613
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:03,253
bail's gonna get set.

614
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,561
That is good news.

615
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,364
May l go now?

616
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,899
Uh, yeah.

617
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,736
Yeah, sure.

618
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:37,023
Who's he?

619
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,528
Padraig Connolly.

620
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:40,530
That's all we need
in this place.

621
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:43,590
Another dumb fucking
spud-eating mick.

622
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:48,100
- Hey, Ryan O'Reily.
- Stand back!

623
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:50,130
- Huh?
- ln the doorway.

624
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:52,233
- No, l just came--
- Step back.

625
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,403
All right,
l like that, Padraig.

626
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:56,345
You're a soldier,
you're cautious.

627
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,712
This is good.

628
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:03,644
How do you know
me name?

629
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:06,088
Oh, on the TV,
past couple of days,

630
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,614
nothing but you
and the lRA executing

631
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:11,526
that British limey commander
officer fuck thing.

632
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:14,258
That was on the telly,
that we executed Captain Harley?

633
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:16,391
That's not what happened.

634
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,925
lt doesn't matter
what happened.

635
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,063
That's what the guys in here
think happened.

636
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:23,539
And believe me,
that's a good'n for the both of us.

637
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:26,236
Mr. O'Reily,
l've no need for what you're selling.

638
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,804
You know, Padraig,
you're starting to piss me off,

639
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:32,407
so l'm just gonna say
this once.

640
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,045
You best start treating Oz
like a North lreland,

641
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:40,547
because in here you walk,
talk, sleep, work, eat,

642
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:43,082
shit and drink
with your own kind.

643
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:44,924
You fucking understand me?

644
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:48,090
Because your name's O'Reily
you're one of my kind?

645
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:51,568
We got the same color
green running through our veins, bro'.

646
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:53,194
lf that were true,
it would matter to you?

647
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:57,936
- What would matter?
- There was no execution.

648
00:44:57,975 --> 00:44:59,840
You should be looking
at me.

649
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:02,869
- We're being watched.
- Watched?

650
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:06,314
l walk out of here
and on body language alone

651
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,979
everyone's gonna know
what's what between the two of us.

652
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:19,522
l won't be here long enough
to need your friendship,

653
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,554
so have a good walk.

654
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:42,083
Connolly?

655
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,019
l'm Timmy Kirk.

656
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,613
This is Jim Burns.

657
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:47,385
Why should l care
what your names are?

658
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,450
We're inviting you
to a Bible study

659
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:52,053
that the Reverend Cloutier
is holding this afternoon.

660
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:53,723
Cloutier?
Who's Cloutier?

661
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:56,198
Today's your conversion day,
Padraig.

662
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,066
Well, either that,

663
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:01,367
or we beat the Catholic
right off you.

664
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:03,134
Your choice.

665
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:16,879
Shit.
Burns, Burns, off.

666
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,186
What's wrong, boys?
Let's not stop now.

667
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:23,159
All right.
Who started it?

668
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:24,821
We're only boxing.

669
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:27,490
- Yeah, without gloves?
- He speaks the truth.

670
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:30,295
Only boxing, sir.
l was demonstrating the techniques

671
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,598
of the great
John L. Sullivan.

672
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:35,264
All right, you two get
the fuck out of here.

673
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:40,906
Listen, Padraig,

674
00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:44,005
if you want me to put
you in protective custody, l will.

675
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,414
Sounds very confining.

676
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,441
No thank you.

677
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:57,522
Mr. Zelman,
what's wrong?

678
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,461
Ah, sit down, son.

679
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:01,931
The bail hearing
not happen?

680
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:04,400
No, it happened,
and it was all set.

681
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:07,233
But here, take a look. That's a letter
from the Justice Department

682
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:10,069
specifically urging
the court to deny you bail.

683
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:14,669
Fucking Christ.
So now what?

684
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:17,704
Well, l'm afraid
this appeal may play out

685
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:19,272
all the way
to the Supreme Court.

686
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:22,012
The fact is you may
be stuck in Oz

687
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:23,485
for a very long time.

688
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,855
Did he-- did he beat you?

689
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:35,661
- What?
- Dad, did he beat you.

690
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,758
- ls-- is that why you left?
- No.

691
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:40,099
He cheated on you.

692
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:43,470
l was barely 17

693
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:46,943
and the world was new
and there were people to see

694
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:49,537
and places to explore.

695
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,775
So it was you
who cheated on him?

696
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,646
l guess.

697
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,743
ln a way.

698
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:58,277
l hate him.
You know?

699
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:02,850
And l would never blame
you for leaving that son of a bitch,

700
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,793
but what l don't get is--

701
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:07,353
is, Jesus,
didn't you even just--

702
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:09,628
Miss you?

703
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:16,798
Ryan, from the night
we made you till the day l left,

704
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,173
you are the only
real happiness l have ever had.

705
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:23,374
l just didn't know
that then.

706
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:25,814
l was a child
with a three-month-old.

707
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:29,080
lt didn't even occur
to me that l'd never see you again.

708
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,748
lt's just how things
had to work out.

709
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,055
No, you-- you're thinking
of Cyril.

710
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:39,062
- What?
- You said three months.

711
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:40,961
Cyril would've been
the baby.

712
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:42,522
No, Ryan,
you were the baby.

713
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:44,591
But l'm a year
and a half older than Cyril.

714
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:47,297
Your father and l
didn't have Cyril.

715
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:50,306
What are you
talking about?

716
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,067
Cyril's your half-brother.

717
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:05,287
Hey, Cyril,
you remember that--

718
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:09,418
that one time when Dad made us go
spend the summer

719
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,894
in lndiana
at Uncle Bill's farm?

720
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,230
lt was you, me
and those three neighbor kids

721
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:20,499
in the fields
walking beans.

722
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:23,233
And Uncle Bill had made
me the foreman

723
00:49:23,274 --> 00:49:25,708
and those three kids
decided to quit

724
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,904
because they thought
l was yelling too much.

725
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:32,712
l think they wanted to go
swimming or something like that.

726
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,547
And they wanted to take you
with them,

727
00:49:34,585 --> 00:49:37,679
but instead

728
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:42,283
you decided
to stay with me

729
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:44,556
in the fields
until we were finished.

730
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:49,222
l've always wondered

731
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:53,498
did you stay with me
'cause we're brothers

732
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:57,871
or did you stay

733
00:49:57,908 --> 00:50:02,140
'cause you thought that if you tried
to leave l'd beat you up?

734
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:15,322
One, two, three, four.
Up. One, two, three.

735
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,328
All that time in the cage,
l never got to exercise.

736
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,694
Not enough room to move.

737
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:22,596
Hey, Jia, we're trying
to work out here.

738
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:24,692
- Want to shut the fuck up?
- l want to try that.

739
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:28,694
- No, stop.
- l could teach you a lot of things

740
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,604
better than
that bullshit boxing.

741
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:33,109
- l want to learn.
- Okay.

742
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,667
There's this.

743
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:37,010
Hey, motherfucker!

744
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,588
No, stay back!
Back!

745
00:50:45,622 --> 00:50:49,285
He hit you!
He hit you!

746
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:51,294
Back! Back!

747
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:53,819
Oh, fuck.

748
00:50:56,867 --> 00:50:59,597
- Well?
- Jia is in a coma.

749
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:01,331
We sent him over
to Benchley Memorial,

750
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:04,535
but l have no idea
when or if he'll wake up.

751
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,736
Another knockout
for Cyril O'Reily.

752
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:09,337
- Jia provoked Cyril.
- So says his brother.

753
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,180
But Ryan O'Reily
isn't exactly trustworthy or unbiased.

754
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:16,550
- What are you saying?
- We've put off this decision enough.

755
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,351
l think we should ship Cyril
to the Conley lnstitute.

756
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,587
- No, that would be a tragic mistake.
- For who?

757
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,186
Cyril's brother is his only lifeline
to reality.

758
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:28,062
We separate them,
the guy's gonna spiral into lunacy.

759
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:30,066
We keep him here,
he gets into more fights,

760
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,727
maybe puts somebody else
in a coma.

761
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:33,669
l think we should transfer
him out today.

762
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:36,468
- You're being cruel.
- Rather cruel than blind.

763
00:51:36,507 --> 00:51:38,270
l have an alternative.

764
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:41,209
Let's place Cyril
in protective custody for a while,

765
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:43,611
allow Ryan regular visits

766
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:46,343
and see how Cyril adjusts.

767
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:49,875
- That makes sense to me.
- Tim?

768
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,353
Fine.

769
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:53,379
As long as he's
out of my hair.

770
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,821
But l don't want to go.

771
00:52:01,865 --> 00:52:05,323
Cyril, trust me.

772
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:07,200
You have to.

773
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:10,673
Because if you don't, they're gonna send
you far, far away from me,

774
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,768
and you and l ain't
gonna see each other no more.

775
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,476
Hey. Come on, man.

776
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:22,542
lt's okay.
Come on, take your bag.

777
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:28,316
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

778
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,829
Hey, Cyril.
Toughen up, all right?

779
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,338
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Yeah?

780
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:44,363
Eliminating Jia,
l owe you.

781
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,904
You got a problem,
friend?

782
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:09,359
l have a confession
to make.

783
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:13,663
Several months ago
l was heading into the gym.

784
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:15,695
No one was there

785
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:18,936
but Ryan O'Reily
and Patrick Keenan.

786
00:53:24,481 --> 00:53:27,644
Because l was so wrapped up
in my own failings,

787
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:30,619
l just pushed
the incident aside,

788
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:33,885
but every day, every time
l'm near O'Reily

789
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:36,722
- l say to myself, ''Do something.''
- Do what, exactly?

790
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,923
Tell the authorities.

791
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:42,898
The attack on Jia Kenmin
only proves

792
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,424
that O'Reily will continue
hurting people.

793
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:48,302
Okay.

794
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,300
We'll go
to Warden Glynn together.

795
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:55,470
Because if O'Reily finds
out that you told...

796
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,538
he'll kill you next.

797
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:03,716
l don't know what
you're talking about.

798
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,085
Patrick Keenan
was my friend.

799
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:08,614
Whoever told you this bullshit
must have it out for me.

800
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:10,627
The informant has
no motive to lie.

801
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,961
Look, Warden,
when those news people were here,

802
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,026
they asked me all about
Adebisi's videotapes

803
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,538
and l didn't say
word one.

804
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:25,337
What? You're expecting
a return of the favor?

805
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,900
- Yeah.
- Fuck you!

806
00:54:27,945 --> 00:54:30,345
l'm gonna
thoroughly investigate these charges.

807
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,282
lf l find any corroborating evidence,
you're going to death row.

808
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,684
You got that?

809
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,421
- What happened?
- CO said he collapsed.

810
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:51,058
- Ryan, are you okay?
- Yeah.

811
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:54,298
l just needed
to talk to you,

812
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:55,896
so l faked falling down.

813
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,964
- You scared the shit out of me.
- l'm sorry.

814
00:54:58,008 --> 00:54:59,839
What's wrong?

815
00:54:59,876 --> 00:55:01,810
We need privacy.

816
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,086
You realize this
is the first time

817
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:15,557
you and l have ever
been alone?

818
00:55:15,592 --> 00:55:17,457
l need to get back
out there, Ryan,

819
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:19,086
so tell me
what's so important.

820
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,421
Everything's turning
to shit, Gloria.

821
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:29,835
There's a good chance
Cyril's gonna end up in a loony farm,

822
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:33,934
and now there's a chance l'm gonna
be convicted for whacking Keenan.

823
00:55:33,977 --> 00:55:36,036
What? How?

824
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,445
Someone jabbered on me
to the warden.

825
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:40,450
Oh, hey, it wasn't you,
was it?

826
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:43,715
- No.
- No, those eyes don't lie.

827
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:47,182
Go on.

828
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:49,522
l also hear
there's a sizable chance

829
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,926
that you're gonna lose
your doctor's license, which means

830
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:55,727
l'll never see you
again.

831
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,700
l know.

832
00:55:57,734 --> 00:56:00,225
So l have a proposition
to make.

833
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:03,465
Don't answer me
right away.

834
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:06,943
l want you to take the time
to really think

835
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:09,502
about what l'm asking.

836
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,949
Which is?

837
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:20,923
l want you to help
Cyril and me escape.

838
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:29,056
Myths are supposed
to teach us something.

839
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:32,967
But what's the life lesson
in this sad tale of Orpheus?

840
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:36,530
No good deed
goes unpunished?

841
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:38,404
Fuck that.

842
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,774
Ain't no such thing
as a good deed.

843
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:43,405
Love conquers all?

844
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:47,076
Never has, never will.

845
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:50,985
Maybe the moral
of the story is that those in power

846
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,989
are just as fucked up
as those who ain't,

847
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:55,992
and the worst thing a body can do
is give up his or her own power

848
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:57,789
to some butt-heads
on Mount Olympus,

849
00:56:57,828 --> 00:56:59,728
'cause if they're
so fucking powerful,

850
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:02,493
how'd they let us get away
with all this shit in the first place?

851
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:05,262
Answer me that.
