1
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:40,641
There's all kinds
of slang words for prison--

2
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,013
''The Joint,'' ''The Slammer,''
''The Big House.''

3
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,781
But my personal favorite
is ''The Clink.''

4
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,057
That's because the word comes
from the sound the chains made

5
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,356
back in the 1400s.

6
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,557
They had these big-ass,
motherfucking iron chains.

7
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,462
The prisoners
weren't allowed to talk,

8
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,831
so when they moved
around the dungeon,

9
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,769
all you heard was ''clink.''

10
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,636
Listen up.

11
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,470
The following are being
transferred

12
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,339
out of Emerald City:

13
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,904
96G333,

14
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:15,642
Guccione;

15
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,981
91H481,

16
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,384
Hardin;

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,184
94S727,

18
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,020
Shirner.

19
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,855
Get your
stuff

20
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,383
and follow
Officer Keating.

21
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,266
Yo, so long, suckers.

22
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,528
Psst!

23
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,095
Blow me.

24
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,460
You got to fix
this damn thing by noon.

25
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,190
Querns...

26
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,391
how can you condone
what Adebisi is doing?

27
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,628
The drugs,
the sex?

28
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,297
He even has a curtain across
his cell to hide his sins.

29
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,068
l don't have to explain
why l condone

30
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,508
what l condone
to you.

31
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,240
No, you don't.

32
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,975
But l can go
to the warden.

33
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,949
l can send you
to the hole.

34
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,252
You know others
have tried to silence me.

35
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:04,155
Others ain't me,
Said.

36
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,215
lf you want
to move to another unit,

37
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,749
l can arrange that.

38
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:11,161
lf not, do what you do best.
Pray to Allah.

39
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:14,030
Rest of the time,
keep your mouth shut.

40
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,789
Arif...

41
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,301
look out there.

42
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,700
Look!

43
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,268
Can you see
what's going on?

44
00:04:58,311 --> 00:04:59,676
Yes.

45
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:03,342
Then how can you
just sit there?

46
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:06,045
You said you
wanted to lead.

47
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,077
Well, in the name
of all that's holy,

48
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,480
lead.

49
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:16,085
All right.
Okay, bye-bye.

50
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,120
Bye.

51
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,094
You're on.

52
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:30,167
l've been trying to get five minutes
with you for days.

53
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,269
Well, you got
them now.

54
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:33,711
Don't waste them
by complaining.

55
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:36,716
First off, when you set up
this new system,

56
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,581
why wasn't l named
one of the trustees?

57
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:42,645
The Muslim population
constitutes 18°/% of Oz.

58
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,715
As their leader, l expect some sort
of representation.

59
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,855
l know the Muslim
population is large,

60
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,888
but as a force,
you all seem...

61
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:54,923
rudderless.

62
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:58,233
You wait, Querns.

63
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,501
You'll feel the full force
of our power.

64
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,268
Are you
threatening me?

65
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,212
Hmm?

66
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,806
Hmm?!

67
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,783
Huh?

68
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,285
Huh?!

69
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,879
Are you
threatening me?

70
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,085
Get your ass
out of here.

71
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,013
But me and Supreme,
we were just talking.

72
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:44,243
l don't want you
anywhere near him.

73
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,377
But l was just listening
to what he had to say.

74
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,148
That's an order.

75
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:50,554
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,923
Now go.
l must pray.

77
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,284
And just then,
l heard a voice,

78
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,120
a thunderous voice
with like--

79
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,092
with like an Eazy-E-type
of nasalness saying,

80
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,186
''Truth casts no shadows

81
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,596
because it soaks sun
like fava sponges,

82
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:35,795
do bungee-cord jumpings
into the abyss.

83
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:39,293
Hold truth
tightly in your fist.''

84
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,466
What did l tell you,
Ketchum?

85
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,274
My name's
Supreme Allah.

86
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,803
Your name
is Kevin Ketchum.

87
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,880
You're nothing
but a low-life corner boy.

88
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,318
What are you,
Arif?

89
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:57,255
Other than a Kareem Said
wannabe?

90
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,520
l'm not warning
you again.

91
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,135
Adebisi.

92
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,761
That's me.

93
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,999
We need to talk
about this guy Ketchum.

94
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,337
Oh, yeah?
What about him?

95
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,309
He's a danger
to us both.

96
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,903
Yeah?
How so?

97
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,414
He's making all these converts
of my people, yours.

98
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,211
l'm not worried.

99
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,717
You should be.

100
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,982
Pretty soon they'll be
following his orders.

101
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,319
Well, me and Supreme,
we have an understanding.

102
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,324
You can't
trust him.

103
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:33,882
What are
you suggesting?

104
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,191
You should do what you usually do
when you face an enemy.

105
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,721
You mean kill him?

106
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,694
l thought you Muslims
are against murder.

107
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,474
Ah, yeah, but it's okay
if l kill him for you, eh?

108
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:54,042
- Adebisi.
- No.

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,105
l says no.

110
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,117
You want him dead,
grab a knife, eh?

111
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,245
Morning.

112
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,474
Hey, Sean, what are you
doing here?

113
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,812
The new guy running
Em City, Querns,

114
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,082
- he and l came to a parting of ways.
- Oh, yeah?

115
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,112
The warden reassigned
me to reception,

116
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,623
but l'll tell you, l'm not cut out
for deskwork.

117
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,421
My guess?

118
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,087
l'll be gone
in a week or two.

119
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,119
Hey, listen,

120
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:47,664
you know what l said
about being mad at you

121
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,669
because you didn't quit
when l was fired? That's bullshit.

122
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,694
Given my
behavior at the time,

123
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:56,140
how could l possibly pass
judgment on what anyone else did?

124
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,837
Tim, you-- you sound
so enlightened.

125
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:00,345
You find God?

126
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,779
Better.

127
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,975
An affordable
shrink.

128
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,484
Let's have dinner
tonight.

129
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:08,919
Okay, but you're
buying.

130
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,946
Okay.

131
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,957
Hey, Andrea.

132
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,965
lt's morning
already?

133
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,796
Quiet night?

134
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,927
lf you count two
fistfights

135
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,064
and some anal
penetration as quiet, yeah.

136
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,438
Who got
in the fights?

137
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:32,842
That biker, Hoyt,
and one of those lrish boys, Keenan.

138
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,051
- Cocksucker!
- Fuck you!

139
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,388
Fucking rape--

140
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,692
Break it up, break it up.
Come on.

141
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,964
Martin, what's up?

142
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,669
As you know,
Sean Murphy has been asked

143
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,507
to transfer out
of Em City

144
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,105
and l've made Travis Smith
my new CO supervisor.

145
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:10,377
Problem is, some of the officers
are loyal to Murphy.

146
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,544
So l'm asking you
to move these COs out

147
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,110
and bring these in.

148
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,755
Okay, done.
Mobay!

149
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,024
l need these transfers
taken care of right away.

150
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,585
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,396
- So how's the campaign going?
- Great.

152
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,128
l say we talk
to the warden.

153
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,899
Nah, he's got his head
up Devlin's ass.

154
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,430
He's not paying attention
to our problems here.

155
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:37,739
We ought to go
to the Union.

156
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,869
Huh? Go to the Union
about what?

157
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:43,347
My pal Querns is replacing
all the COs in Em City

158
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,351
with people
of his own choosing.

159
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,353
That's his right.

160
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:51,289
Yeah, only he's choosing
all black guys.

161
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,451
Oh, well,

162
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:56,018
good news is you can come
work for me in Unit B.

163
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,189
Really?

164
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,960
Yeah, l could use
the muscle, believe me.

165
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,933
l'll go to Glynn.
l'll make the transfers.

166
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,435
- Thanks, Tim.
- Sounds good.

167
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,461
- Hey, we were a great team, right?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,242
Okay.

169
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:12,710
- l'll put the paperwork through.
- Good.

170
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:15,043
- Hey, Leo.
- What?

171
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,845
Doesn't it bother you
that Querns is putting together

172
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,852
an exclusively
black staff?

173
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,855
Look, l told the man
he could run his unit any way he wanted

174
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,449
as long as the violence
was kept down.

175
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,516
Okay? You know,
since Querns took over,

176
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,653
there's been no significant
nonsense in Em City.

177
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,663
Yeah.

178
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,688
How long is that
going to last?

179
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,237
There's that Romanian place around
the corner.

180
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,434
lt's a dump,
but the food's delicious,

181
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,205
especially that
''chumala de mia.''

182
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,474
Well, well,
Frick and Frack.

183
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,481
l hear you two choirboys
are working

184
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,415
together
again in Unit B.

185
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,043
That's right.

186
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,781
l just got a
transfer myself.

187
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,016
Seems the warden was in
a tizzy 'cause Querns

188
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,115
got all black
COs in Em City.

189
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,895
You're going to work
in Emerald City?

190
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,522
Yeah.

191
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,193
Life's full of ironies,
isn't it?

192
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,351
For Christ's sake, Ginzburg,
l can't take it anymore.

193
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,983
All day, all night
with the vomiting.

194
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,425
Why don't you
hurry up and die?

195
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,021
Jesus.

196
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,191
l just came from seeing
Nat Ginzburg.

197
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,632
What's he want?

198
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,328
You know he
has AlDS.

199
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:46,497
Yeah, but he refuses
to move to the AlDS ward.

200
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,871
Gloria tells me
he hasn't got long to live,

201
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:51,308
but he's tired
of fighting the disease,

202
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:54,836
so he asked me
to ask you

203
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,849
if it would
be possible

204
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,407
to move up
the execution.

205
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,442
Move up
the execution?

206
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,078
Yeah.

207
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,157
No one's ever asked
to be executed early.

208
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,683
l mean, the court set
a specific date.

209
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,889
There's no legal precedent
to change it.

210
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,421
So let's start
a precedent.

211
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,957
You're encouraging
me to do this,

212
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,664
given your own position
against capital punishment?

213
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:21,832
The man is
dying, Leo.

214
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:24,741
l believe, in this particular case,
ending his life would be a--

215
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,506
a blessing.

216
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,104
That's euthanasia.

217
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,708
l thought your church
was against euthanasia.

218
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,219
My church is against
a lot of things l'm not.

219
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:40,453
Okay, l'll call
the lawyers.

220
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,620
Good.

221
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,892
State troopers closed
Bear Mountain this morning

222
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:48,264
after a reported sighting of escaped
convict Miguel Alvarez.

223
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,963
An extensive search
was launched, but Alvarez,

224
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:52,732
who has been missing
for three weeks,

225
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,763
once again
evaded capture.

226
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:58,072
ln a related story, Superior Court Judge
Mason Kossler today

227
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,772
granted the unusual request
of convicted murderer

228
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,644
Nathaniel Ginzburg,

229
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,445
who asked to be executed
two months earlier

230
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,451
than the court
had ordered.

231
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:09,079
The execution will
take place next Thursday

232
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,555
at the Oswald
State Correctional Facility.

233
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,219
Sister Pete's
here to see you.

234
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,802
How do l look?

235
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,606
You look like
Susan Hayward.

236
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,041
Bingo. That's what
l was going for.

237
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,079
Sister,
l'm so grateful to you

238
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,979
for everything
you've done,

239
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:38,643
but l've got to ask you
one more favor.

240
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:39,981
Anything.

241
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,419
My nails.

242
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,013
l'm so excited

243
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,081
l can't hold
the damn brush still.

244
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,457
- Will you do me?
- Sure.

245
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,054
Sit down.

246
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,124
Okay.

247
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,828
Try to keep your
hands still.

248
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:01,396
Okay, that's it.

249
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,936
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

250
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,344
You know what? No, no.
You'd better lie down.

251
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,111
We'll finish
your nails later, okay?

252
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,921
5:00 AM...

253
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,152
l got me a date
with an angel.

254
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,218
You rest.

255
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:28,792
Ginzburg's dead tomorrow
because he killed Antonio Nappa.

256
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,859
Yeah?

257
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:34,964
- You wanted him to do it.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,736
Doesn't that bother you
a little?

259
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:38,767
He's dying
'cause of you.

260
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:43,445
No. This is
the life we chose.

261
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,416
Sure,
but Chucky...

262
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,442
are you afraid of
dying?

263
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,217
No.

264
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,351
What the fuck are you
doing with a cigarette, Pancamo?

265
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,486
Smoking it?

266
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,895
Put it out.
Now!

267
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,762
Or l'm coming
in there.

268
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,935
Now her,
l'm afraid of.

269
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:13,506
l heard Ginzburg
picked the gas chamber as a way to die.

270
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,174
That'd be
all right.

271
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,513
One minute you're sitting
there breathing in and out,

272
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,348
stuff fills
your lungs.

273
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:22,479
Next thing
you know,

274
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,648
you don't
know nothing.

275
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,386
- A blow job.
- What?

276
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:30,156
lnstead
of a last meal,

277
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:34,792
they should give you
one last blow job.

278
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,826
Yeah.

279
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,978
Ginzburg, it's time.

280
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,812
Ginzburg?

281
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,960
Nat?

282
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:03,985
Oh, my God.
He's cold.

283
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,701
He's dead.

284
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,225
Get a doctor.

285
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,373
Go figure.

286
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:18,844
He dies in his sleep
of natural causes.

287
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,104
He looks so beautiful.

288
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,576
What are
you doing?

289
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,146
l'm going to
finish his nails.

290
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:45,994
Count!

291
00:18:58,017 --> 00:18:59,882
Mobay.

292
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,857
Mobay, get your ass
in the air.

293
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:37,145
Yeah, yeah.
Coming.

294
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:51,999
Mobay, pay attention.

295
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,698
Tomorrow
we get healthy.

296
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,003
''Healthy?''
What does that mean, ''healthy?''

297
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,339
lt means we're getting
a new shipment in.

298
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,971
- Where?
- None of your business.

299
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,105
So, Mobay,
T-Brown,

300
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,344
l want each of you
to bring me five new babies.

301
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:08,376
Babies?

302
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,355
- Some new customers,brother.
- Babies. Okay.

303
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,484
Poet,
you supervise.

304
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,518
l don't need
supervising.

305
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,158
What you need

306
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,637
is to learn
to take an order.

307
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:30,970
Yes... sir.

308
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,543
Mobay.

309
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,947
You know Detective McGorry
from Homicide?

310
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:41,180
- Sure. Hi, Guinevere.
- John.

311
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,415
You're here about
the death of Bruno Gergan.

312
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,980
Gergan may have been a bad cop,
but he turned state's evidence

313
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,583
in the gun
smuggling case.

314
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,719
The DA is pissed
that his prime witness

315
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,559
didn't last a week
in Oz.

316
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,690
Any idea
who killed him?

317
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,633
l thought him falling
down the elevator shaft was an accident.

318
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,995
No, my gut says
otherwise.

319
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,701
You think somebody
whacked Gergan

320
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,208
'cause they found
out he was a cop?

321
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,006
No, this is--
this is something else.

322
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:07,740
l just can't figure out
what yet.

323
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,748
Wait, Mobay.
Please, man, please!

324
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,742
Well, if l can help
your investigation in any way...

325
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:16,311
Yeah.
Keep your ears open.

326
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:17,982
You hear boasting,
you call me.

327
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,184
Warden, l'm gonna
set up some interviews,

328
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:22,455
- starting with Gergan's cell-mate.
- Okay.

329
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,020
Later.

330
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,134
So, you in good

331
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,866
with Adebisi
and the boys?

332
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,737
Yes.

333
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:38,038
They've got a fresh supply
showing up tomorrow,

334
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:39,908
only l can't find out
which door.

335
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,675
They also wanted me to recruit
some new buyers.

336
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:46,151
As a police officer,
you can't sell drugs.

337
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:47,914
l know.

338
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:50,683
l'll use the cash l have
and pretend l found my ''babies.''

339
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:02,790
- Hey, there's your boy.
- Okay.

340
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,826
l got him.
l got him.

341
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,270
- Where you been?
- Recruiting.

342
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,333
l got two babies.

343
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:13,902
- Who?
- l don't know their names.

344
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,470
Well, point 'em out
to me, man.

345
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:17,982
- They already left.
- Shit.

346
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,814
Well, give me
that money, man.

347
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:21,649
Come on, come on,
come on.

348
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,746
- l'm out of tits.
- All right.

349
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:27,416
Here you go.

350
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,256
Keep on selling,
baby.

351
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:31,592
Keep on selling.

352
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,537
Hey, Mobay.
Give it a rest, man.

353
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:41,732
You been shoving that shit
up your nose since lights out.

354
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,366
l want to get
some sleep.

355
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,942
So sleep.

356
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:51,609
What'd you say?

357
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,811
Nothing, sorry.

358
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:23,304
Sister Peter Marie.

359
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:28,252
l'm glad the warden
told you who l really am.

360
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,684
l need to talk and l need
this to be confidential.

361
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,717
Of course.

362
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,365
Oz is my first big
undercover assignment.

363
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,766
A lot of the guys
l work with in Narcotics

364
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,963
didn't think l could handle
the job, but l knew l could.

365
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,995
Thought l could.

366
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,933
Left my wife
and son,

367
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:55,538
told them l'd be gone l don't
know how many months.

368
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,572
Abby--
that's my wife--

369
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:02,984
she's worried,
naturally,

370
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,649
that l'll
be found out,

371
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,387
that l'll be killed.

372
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:10,418
Today's Robby's birthday.

373
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:17,057
l thought l was close
to busting the drug ring,

374
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,094
but l'm not.

375
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,965
Only l've got to.

376
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,871
l blow this,
my career is over,

377
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:28,903
l'm back to riding
the subways arresting bums.

378
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,074
So l gotta stay.
l gotta see this through.

379
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,277
But--

380
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,717
but, Sister,

381
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:47,460
l'm an addict.

382
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,632
People in love
sometimes say that they're

383
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:57,642
''head over heels,''

384
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:00,338
but if they knew what
the phrase really meant,

385
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,939
l'm not sure that
they'd make the claim.

386
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:05,279
Back in the bad
old days,

387
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,342
as a warning
to criminals,

388
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:09,547
judges would order
malcontents to be

389
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:12,887
hung by their ankles,
heels over head.

390
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:16,258
The phrase came to mean
a state of helplessness,

391
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:18,388
confusion.

392
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:21,857
Now that l think
of it,

393
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,891
that is being
in love.

394
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,932
What should l do
if l ever find out who killed Gary?

395
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:31,409
You should
whack 'em.

396
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:33,638
Yeah?
lt'll be my pleasure.

397
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,306
What the fuck?

398
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:38,009
You murdered my son!

399
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:58,296
My son is dead.
Nothing can change that.

400
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,237
And Keller
had Gary killed.

401
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,638
Nothing's gonna change
that either.

402
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:06,770
Beecher, killing Keller
is no way to mourn your child.

403
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,440
What, now you're defending
that cocksucker?

404
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:12,314
No. He must
be punished.

405
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:15,343
But not by you.

406
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:20,448
Tobias, the F.B.l. found
your daughter.

407
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,483
Holly's alive.

408
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,908
We investigated
the lead you gave us.

409
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,881
Bob ''Big Butt'' Towland
had nothing to do with the kidnapping.

410
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,907
He'd been arrested
two days before

411
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,976
and was sitting
in the Crown and Shield Holding Center

412
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,419
awaiting arraignment.

413
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,388
But if he didn't do it,
that means...

414
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:54,449
Chris Keller
is innocent.

415
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,863
Oh, Christ.

416
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:02,333
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

417
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,130
We arrested
the real kidnapper this morning.

418
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:06,694
Tobias...

419
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:08,797
it's Hank Schillinger.

420
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:17,974
Sit down, Vern.

421
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:20,951
We got a couple
of items to discuss.

422
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:24,312
Oh, do we now?

423
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:46,610
l got a file
just full

424
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,408
of fights between
you two.

425
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:49,937
Plus...

426
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:52,712
l'm told you like to fuck
each other up the ass.

427
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:56,619
Now l'm not wild
about either practice,

428
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:59,920
so, Keller, l'm moving
you to another pod.

429
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,416
But if either of you
touches the other in love or war,

430
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:07,956
l will transfer both of you to Gen Pop.
Understood?

431
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,265
- Yes.
- Yes.

432
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:13,464
Keller, go pack.

433
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,133
Beecher, l have
other business with you.

434
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,838
The warden tells me
that an inmate from Unit B,

435
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:25,611
Vern Schillinger,
may be responsible

436
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,277
for your son's death.

437
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,378
So we've decided
for the time being

438
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:31,753
to restrict your movements
through the rest of Oz.

439
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,815
No library or gym
privileges,

440
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,919
and you'll eat your
meals here at Em City.

441
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:39,157
He killed my son
and l get punished for it?

442
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:42,655
Well, given the fact
that l have transferred

443
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,101
all the Aryans out
of Em City,

444
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,002
this is the safest
place for you.

445
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,666
Safe?

446
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,733
Relatively speaking.

447
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,785
- Chris?
- Don't. Don't even.

448
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:08,154
My son died horribly.

449
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:11,060
l was out of my mind
with grief.

450
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,532
You actually thought in your heart
that l could do such a thing?

451
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:17,057
Order the murder
of a child?

452
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,061
Your child?

453
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,408
Yeah, you've got plenty
of reasons

454
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:25,307
to assume
the worst about me.

455
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,642
but l worked very hard...

456
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:33,117
to regain your trust,

457
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,641
your love.

458
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:37,120
l thought l had,
but this proves that l haven't.

459
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:38,816
- Chris...
- l don't, l can't--

460
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,324
- Please.
- l never will.

461
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,053
- Please.
- No. We're over.

462
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:43,891
We're finished.
We're done.

463
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,362
Chris, you gotta
forgive me.

464
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:46,921
No.

465
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,424
l forgave you.

466
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,829
Well, l guess that
makes you the better man.

467
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,179
Howdy.

468
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,478
l's your
new neighbor.

469
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:14,124
This is my bunk.

470
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,921
lt ain't no more.

471
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:21,699
Mondo...

472
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,963
play nice.

473
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:26,368
Lunch detail!

474
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:27,894
Follow me.

475
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:41,179
- Feds arrested Hank?
- Yeah.

476
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,449
After letting
the girl go,

477
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:45,046
feds surrounded him.

478
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,185
Push comes to shove
and the federal boys leaning on him,

479
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,286
think your son'll
give you up?

480
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,756
Honest to Christ,
l don't know.

481
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:59,961
Hey, Vern.

482
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,700
Four marriages,

483
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,403
l never had any kids,
so l don't know dick about parenting,

484
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:08,674
but you, fuck,
you deserve some sort of prize.

485
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:11,614
One son, you give him
drugs knowing he'll OD.

486
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,515
The other you set up
for lethal injection.

487
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,077
You're father of the fucking year,
but you know what the best news is?

488
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,954
When both your sons are dead,
that'll be the end of it,

489
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,958
'cause you ain't making
any more children. Not in here.

490
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:23,859
So that when you die,
your name dies with you.

491
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:26,363
Everything you are
dies when you do.

492
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:35,001
And the world'll be
a better place.

493
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:42,413
Well, well, well, what have
we got up in here?

494
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,415
Oh, l see.
My man Keller.

495
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:45,916
What's up, dog?

496
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,818
Hey, Keller, man,
l gotta ask you a question, man.

497
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,616
You mind if l fuck
your girlfriend Beecher?

498
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:53,624
You mind if she
sucks my cock?

499
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:56,650
l don't give a fuck what you do
or what he does.

500
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:58,060
You heard that,
Leroy?

501
00:31:58,096 --> 00:31:59,893
l did, Mondo.
l did.

502
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:02,229
All right, 'cause we
don't want no problems in Em City,

503
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:05,464
so it goes on record
that l got Keller's permission

504
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:08,802
- to fuck Beecher up the yazoo.
- Yes, you do.

505
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:18,109
Peace.

506
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,131
What happened
to your hand?

507
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:47,636
l was remembering
what hell felt like.

508
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,739
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.

509
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,912
ln the past year or so, l've committed
numerous homosexual acts.

510
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,883
Do you want me
to elaborate?

511
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:01,653
No.

512
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,888
Before coming
to Oz,

513
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,362
l had sex
with several men...

514
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:15,872
and then
l whacked them.

515
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:18,102
What?

516
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:22,079
After sex,
l murdered them.

517
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:23,671
Why?

518
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:30,486
l didn't want them to tell anyone,
to speak my name.

519
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:33,320
You have to go to the authorities
and confess.

520
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:36,054
What?

521
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,056
You can't
absolve me?

522
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:43,499
l can absolve you, but the only way
to show God

523
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,594
that you're truly sorry is to go
to the police.

524
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,565
Look...

525
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,015
l'm truly sorry, okay?
So just fucking absolve me.

526
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,984
No.

527
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,593
Give me my
fucking penance.

528
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:15,590
No.

529
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,228
God damn you.

530
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,138
God damn you
to fucking hell,

531
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,644
you goddamn
hack in black.

532
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:36,950
Oh, no.

533
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:53,468
Come on, Beecher,
suck my dick.

534
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:55,803
Jesus, you're such
a romantic.

535
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,070
That the way you talk
to your women?

536
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,976
Well, when l'm horny,
the less talk the better.

537
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,817
Okay, lover boy.

538
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:14,415
Pucker up.

539
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:32,975
For centuries,

540
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:35,036
part of any punishment
was humiliation.

541
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,776
ln England, they'd hang
a criminal inside a cage

542
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:40,375
a few feet off the ground

543
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:42,784
in the middle
of the town square.

544
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:46,222
The filthy fuck sat
in his cage looking like a canary,

545
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:49,693
like a parakeet.

546
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:51,718
So people started calling
them ''jailbirds.''

547
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:56,595
Only the kind of chirping
we do in Oz...

548
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,602
ain't all
that pretty.

549
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,998
- Mr. Morales.
- Mr. Rebadow.

550
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,193
My request.

551
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,169
You said you needed time
to think it over.

552
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:34,137
Ah, yes.

553
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,969
Well?

554
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:39,143
When you asked me
to kill Raul Hernandez,

555
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,737
you said l could have
anything l wanted in return.

556
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,413
And now you want me
to let you kill someone else.

557
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:50,716
Yes.

558
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,327
Oddly enough,

559
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,659
there's no one l need exterminated
at the present time.

560
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,721
Besides...

561
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,359
as a newly-appointed trustee,
l have promised Querns

562
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:06,336
that there will be
no violence in Emerald City.

563
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,931
You're going
against your word.

564
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:10,770
Ask for
something else--

565
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,106
cigarettes,
money, drugs.

566
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,112
l want to kill
somebody.

567
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,114
lf you have
your heart set on it,

568
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:18,775
why do you need
my permission?

569
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,875
Not permission,
protection.

570
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,443
That you can have.

571
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,682
No matter who l kill?

572
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,392
You aren't gonna
do anything crazy, are you?

573
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:32,760
Like waste Pancamo?

574
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,856
Certainly not.

575
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:37,527
Then who are you
gonna kill?

576
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,764
Who indeed?

577
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:25,943
May l join you?

578
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:28,885
May l join you,
Busmalis?

579
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,683
You're talking
to me?

580
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,883
You're actually saying words
intended for my ears?

581
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:35,586
Yes.

582
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:38,118
l've been treating you badly,
and l'm sorry.

583
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,720
You mean all's
forgiven?

584
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:42,426
That's right.
All's forgiven.

585
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,902
Would you like
my pie?

586
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:49,395
Yes.
Yes!

587
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,605
l'm tired
but happy.

588
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:01,284
You're speaking
to me again.

589
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:03,344
The chicken
at dinner was edible.

590
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:06,789
All in all,
life is good.

591
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:10,123
l'm the happiest
of men.

592
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:15,325
Lights out!

593
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,994
l've been reading
''The Art of War'' by Sun Tzu.

594
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:21,695
Fascinating stuff.

595
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,436
The instinct to kill

596
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:27,273
is as common as the need
to procreate.

597
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:31,580
Those of us in Oz are actually
the normal ones,

598
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:36,420
following nature's lead.

599
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,581
Funny, huh, Busmalis?

600
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:44,918
Busmalis?

601
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:24,257
Jesus!

602
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:25,826
Help!
What are you doing?

603
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,838
- Get him off me!
- Fucking Christ.

604
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:29,897
He's trying to kill me.

605
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,465
Jesus Christ!
He cut me!

606
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,204
Give me this!

607
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:35,405
You're doing fucking time.

608
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:37,846
- You're okay.
- What the fuck did he do that for?

609
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:41,181
Shit! God damn,
l'm all cut up here.

610
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,487
Eddie.

611
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:21,788
Hey. Yeah.
No, it's me.

612
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,589
That's why
l'm calling.

613
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:25,459
Yeah.
Right.

614
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,020
You'll get it done
by next week?

615
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:29,794
Good. No later
than next week, right?

616
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,201
Okay. All right.
See you.

617
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,620
- You called for me?
- Did you put Hoyt into solitary?

618
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,055
No.

619
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,024
- He tried to kill me.
- l know.

620
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:58,085
But so far,
neither of you will tell me why.

621
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:00,097
lt's personal.

622
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:01,928
Fine.

623
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,763
You ask for
protective custody,

624
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,826
l set you up here.

625
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,497
But sooner or later,
l'm bringing you back,

626
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:09,870
and Hoyt or one of his
biker buddies

627
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,535
will finish the job on you.
So go ahead,

628
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,568
keep it personal.

629
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:17,910
Wait!

630
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,155
l will tell you.

631
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,885
Everything.

632
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,319
Galino had a cell phone.

633
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:34,263
After he died,
l got hold of it.

634
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:36,459
Now O'Reily's got it.

635
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,661
He's hidden it somewhere
in Em City.

636
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:50,214
Where is it?
The cell phone.

637
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:52,113
What-- what cell phone,
Mr. Querns?

638
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:53,480
You know
which cell phone.

639
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,508
They're against
the rules, sir.

640
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:00,213
Mm-hmm.

641
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,319
- You didn't find it?
- No.

642
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,922
And without that cell phone,
l have no way

643
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:09,364
- of proving your story is true.
- So what happens now?

644
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,528
Well, l leave you here
a couple more days,

645
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,936
then l'm sending
you back.

646
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:16,701
To die.

647
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,973
All right,
Mr. Querns,

648
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:23,412
l have two requests.

649
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:25,506
l would like to see
my girlfriend

650
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:28,450
and a rabbi.

651
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,477
l'll set it up.

652
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,053
l am soon very likely
going to die.

653
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:39,654
- Nikolai.
- There is one thing you must do for me.

654
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:41,824
Anything.

655
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:44,198
Tonight at 5:00 PM,

656
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:47,068
l want you to dial
this phone number.

657
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,440
lt must
be 5:00 PM sharp.

658
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,551
ln my proudest moment
as your Governor,

659
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:05,112
l signed the law that
reinstated the death penalty.

660
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:07,351
Together, we've made
great strides

661
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:10,019
in the war on crime,
but there's much more to do.

662
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:11,858
Let's finish the job.

663
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:15,388
The courage to lead:
James Devlin for Governor.

664
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,191
A long time ago...

665
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,726
if a man stole
another man's cow

666
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:23,934
or lamb or pig
and butchered it

667
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:26,500
and was found
with the animal's blood

668
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,671
on his fingers,

669
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,681
he was said to be caught

670
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:33,275
''red-handed.''

671
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:36,480
Of course, if the robber
was too cocky to wash his hands,

672
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,818
maybe he deserved
to get busted.

673
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:42,890
Count!

674
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:05,638
Shit.

675
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:13,085
Fuck.

676
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,743
l never touched
the cell phone.

677
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,439
He never let me
touch it.

678
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:37,242
l didn't kill
Galino.

679
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:38,509
Stanislofsky did.

680
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:39,846
lt's his word
against mine.

681
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:42,444
l got five guys
that'll back me up.

682
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:47,253
l want Stanislofsky dead.

683
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,556
Protective custody?
No can do.

684
00:45:50,594 --> 00:45:52,892
l thought you had some
clout in this fucking place.

685
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,696
Sorry, O'Reily.

686
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:59,066
Your brother,
he sleep all day?

687
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:01,628
No, no, they just got
him on this new medication

688
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,663
to calm him down
and stuff.

689
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:07,436
lf you ask me,
he's too calm.

690
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:18,078
Cyril, psst.

691
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:21,858
Cyril?

692
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,826
Cyril, wake up.

693
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:26,261
Cyril!

694
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:29,698
Cyril, wake up!
Cyril, wake the fuck up!

695
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,633
Cyril!
Fuck!

696
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:34,194
Officer Smith, there's something
the matter with my brother.

697
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,865
- What do you mean?
- l don't know. Hurry up.

698
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:37,897
Call a fucking doctor.
Let's go.

699
00:46:37,942 --> 00:46:41,503
Central, this is 16.
We got a possible four here.

700
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:49,581
Let's start two large lVs
with normal saline running wide open.

701
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,850
- We'll need to tube him.
- What happened?

702
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,413
He OD'd
on the Haldol.

703
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:02,930
- O'Reily?
- What?

704
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,901
- Any news on your brother?
- No.

705
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:07,529
The-- the fucking hacks,
they tell me to wait here

706
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:09,630
and l'm fucking waiting
here and there's nothing.

707
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:11,436
What's going on
in there?

708
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:13,033
l'm sure he'll
be fine.

709
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:14,704
You know, she did this.

710
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:16,212
This-- this fucking
Dr. Nathan.

711
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,306
She gives him too much of the
drugs on purpose.

712
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:20,317
lt's her way of trying
to get back at me.

713
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:21,943
l don't think she's capable
of something like that.

714
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:23,954
Hey, Gloria
fucking hates me.

715
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,354
Wake up. l mean, she thinks
l hired Keenan to rape her.

716
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,950
Now she's got my brother back
there in her clutches

717
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:30,927
and there's not a fucking thing
l can do about it.

718
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:32,690
l fucking hate
this place!

719
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,789
Fuck!
Cyril!

720
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:38,801
Gloria.
How's Cyril?

721
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:41,066
They pumped his stomach.
He's breathing normally.

722
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:43,767
Problem is, we don't know
how long he was unconscious

723
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:46,503
before they brought him in
so the next few hours will be dicey,

724
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:48,603
but l think
he'll be fine.

725
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:51,444
How does that
make you feel?

726
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:54,576
- Are we suddenly in session?
- No.

727
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,143
No, l just wanted to be sure
that he gets the best care that he can.

728
00:47:57,188 --> 00:48:00,783
Oh, and you don't think
that l'm capable of separating

729
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:02,917
my professional obligations
from my anger?

730
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,394
l think that right now
you're so turned around

731
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:06,987
you can't see
which way to go.

732
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:09,898
- l have other patients, if you don't--
- Gloria.

733
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:13,028
Ryan O'Reily did not hire
that man to rape you.

734
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,765
He admitted that
he did.

735
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:17,000
He told you what
you wanted to hear.

736
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:21,442
Keenan raped me
because of O'Reily.

737
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:23,446
The attack on
you was random.

738
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,710
lf Keenan hadn't
raped you,

739
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:28,047
he would've raped
someone else.

740
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:40,693
- Hi, Keenan.
- Hey.

741
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:43,325
Hey, luck
of the lrish, right?

742
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,358
- Yeah.
- All right.

743
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,932
Hey, l want you to do
something for me.

744
00:48:49,974 --> 00:48:52,169
Anything.

745
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:54,200
l want you
to tell me.

746
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:56,042
About what?

747
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,708
When you raped
Dr. Nathan,

748
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:01,013
l want to know what it
was like to fuck her.

749
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,118
Okay.

750
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:09,993
She was heading
into her apartment,

751
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:12,222
looking so hot.

752
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:14,163
Yeah.

753
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,367
How you feeling?

754
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:19,028
My head hurts.

755
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:21,196
That'll go away.

756
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:23,672
Where's Ryan?

757
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,868
l don't know.
Probably Em City.

758
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,275
And then l just
slammed my cock into her.

759
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:30,246
l slammed her.

760
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,011
You don't like us,
do you?

761
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,018
l like you.

762
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,680
Until she couldn't
scream no more.

763
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:39,586
Couldn't breathe
no more.

764
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:41,887
My brother...

765
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:45,459
he does bad things,

766
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:48,932
but deep down he's
not bad.

767
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:54,098
l came inside her
and she was moaning.

768
00:49:57,408 --> 00:49:59,399
He loves you.

769
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,102
With all his heart.

770
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:09,786
Jesus.

771
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,378
You sure did
a job on her, huh?

772
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:12,889
Oh, yeah.

773
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:14,914
Yeah.

774
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,156
So you say you want
to work for me?

775
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:21,255
Definitely.

776
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:22,788
l do things different
here in Oz

777
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,664
than the way we
worked on the street.

778
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:28,502
For instance, when l want
someone dead,

779
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:31,099
l never grease
them myself.

780
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:33,302
l always--
l always talk someone else

781
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:34,868
into doing
the deed for me.

782
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:38,404
l make them believe
the person l want dead is their enemy.

783
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:41,077
That way the kill
can't be traced back to me.

784
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:42,847
That's so cool.

785
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:44,581
You got, what,
seven years till parole?

786
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:46,054
Uh-huh.

787
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,717
You think you'll
go the distance?

788
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:50,727
- Sure, l'll get out.
- Yeah. That's good.

789
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:52,729
You keep believing
that, Patrick.

790
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:55,027
You know how l said
that l always

791
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:57,625
- get someone to kill for me?
- Yeah.

792
00:50:57,668 --> 00:50:59,636
Well...

793
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:04,770
in your case, l'm gonna make
an exception.

794
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,732
Take him down
to the morgue.

795
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:12,032
My only real memory from that night
was this shamrock.

796
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:17,509
l remember the light from
the streetlamp kept bouncing off it.

797
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:23,716
When they brought Keenan
into the ER, l thought,

798
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,950
''Good.

799
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:30,983
He's dead.
Good.''

800
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:35,594
You were right.

801
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:39,929
l came back
too soon.

802
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:45,073
l need to take
some time,

803
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:48,339
you know, just put
my anger back

804
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:50,437
in its proper place.

805
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,508
Maybe then l can learn
to forgive,

806
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,850
myself more than anyone.

807
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:06,724
The job will be here

808
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:09,095
whenever you decide
to come back.

809
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,232
lf l come back, Leo.

810
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:19,107
''To seal one's fate.''

811
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:22,202
Years ago, the death sentence
could not be carried out

812
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:25,443
unless the death warrant
had the judge's official seal

813
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:27,916
affixed to the bottom.

814
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:30,146
lmagine...

815
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:32,621
the only thing standing
between you and death

816
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:36,717
is a little lump
of melted wax.

817
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:43,293
But that's the thing
about life.

818
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,628
The big changes all
come because of

819
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,867
little lumps of wax.
