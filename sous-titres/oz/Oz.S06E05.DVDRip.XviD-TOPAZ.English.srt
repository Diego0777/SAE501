1
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,056
A wise man once said,

2
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,625
"Life is an adventure
in forgiveness."

3
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,468
You might rank bungee jumps
off a bridge in New Zealand

4
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,099
or bachelor parties in Vegas
a few notches higher

5
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,369
on the adventure ladder.

6
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,775
But think about
the risks involved.

7
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,006
You could climb
to the mountaintop of attrition

8
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,040
only to get shot down by a victim
who refuses to forgive.

9
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,813
Think about the rewards...

10
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,651
A chance to heal
those nasty wounds,

11
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,021
reconcile
with someone you love.

12
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,219
Huh, now that
I think about it,

13
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,251
forgiveness
might knock bungee jumps

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,889
and bachelor parties
off the charts.

15
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,270
It's okay.
Take a break.

16
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,575
Cutler's a suicide, huh?

17
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,079
That's what
Reimondo's saying,

18
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,549
- and I ain't disagreeing.
- I didn't imagine you would.

19
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,845
So now what,
Vern?

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,853
Someone else
needs to commit suicide

21
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,117
- before I get some respect?
- Jesus Christ, Robson,

22
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,249
you made your point.
Shut the fuck up and spot me.

23
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,589
And... one.

24
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,998
Come on! Come on!

25
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,266
Miguel, sit down.

26
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,177
What did I do?

27
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,806
Well, that's
what I'm wondering.

28
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,146
Tell me about your relationship
with Wolfgang Cutler.

29
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,278
Cutler, the Nazi guy? We didn't
have a relationship.

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,255
Dome-head was an equal
opportunity racist.

31
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,952
Would it surprise you if he
left you something in his will?

32
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,051
He left me
something?

33
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,528
- Like what?
- Everything he owned.

34
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,259
What?

35
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,427
You are the sole beneficiary
of all his worldly goods,

36
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,561
both in Oz
and on the outside.

37
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,801
His house, his car...

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,139
hell, his 1942
Indian motorcycle.

39
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,374
- Get the fuck out of here.
- The will is signed, notarized.

40
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,779
Are you shittin' me?

41
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,147
I barely even spoke
to the fucking guy,

42
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,153
a couple of times
at rehearsal. That's it.

43
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,712
The guy had
any wife, kids,

44
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,657
- family, anything?
- Wife, no kids.

45
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,027
- This is fucking crazy.
- We packed up his cell,

46
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,158
put all his belongings
into a box.

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,997
You'll have to decide
what you want to keep.

48
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,562
I'm not gonna look
through a dead guy's things.

49
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,540
Jesus.

50
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,081
I guess we'll have to wait
till the afterlife to find out

51
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,952
why Cutler would give his
belongings to a fucking wetback.

52
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,184
Yo, I'm as bugged
out as you.

53
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,091
I know you guys spent
a lot of time with Cutler.

54
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,856
Did he ever mention
anything about me?

55
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,921
Yeah, in his sleep
at night.

56
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,592
He'd whisper your name.

57
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,831
- Fuck off!
- I'll suggest this now,

58
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,532
or I'll find a way
to make it happen later,

59
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,370
you sign all his stuff
over to his wife.

60
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:40,345
- I already thought about that.
- Don't think, spic, do.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
You know? Maybe I should
give all his assets to you, Roby,

62
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,011
being that you already
gave him your ass.

63
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,849
Cunt.

64
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,969
Did you miss me?
I've been missing you.

65
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,874
What happened to you
the last few months?

66
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,785
Well, things got
a little hectic.

67
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,257
But now I'm back
on track.

68
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,490
Goddamn, Leez,
you look good.

69
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,838
Beat me off, baby.

70
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,866
Will you relax? What the fuck
is your problem?

71
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,879
- Let go of me!
- Sit down now!

72
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,710
Let go of me,
you cocksucker!

73
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,512
- What did you just call me?
- Cocksucker!

74
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,610
Don't you ever call me
that again, ever!

75
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,417
- What's your problem?!
- I'm not a cocksucker!

76
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,447
Fuck!

77
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,385
Fuck!

78
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,503
I'm at a Chinese
restaurant.

79
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:48,735
My fortune cookie says,
"Whoever opts for revenge

80
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,006
- should dig two graves."
- I hate Chinese food.

81
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,672
- Shut the fuck up, Hank.
- "Shut the fuck up, Hank."

82
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,150
My brother is an annoying
little prick, but I forgive him.

83
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,177
Why? 'Cause we only get
two choices...

84
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,918
Forgive,
or die a slow death.

85
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,189
One of them studies
doctors do shows that

86
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,563
carrying around the baggage
of anger and bitterness,

87
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,330
can put you at risk
for mental illness,

88
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,736
for depression
and anxiety,

89
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:24,141
as well as strokes,
heart disease and heart attacks.

90
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,341
Who knew? Forgiveness
is good for your health.

91
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,887
Everybody's attention,
please.

92
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,952
Can I have your attention,
please?

93
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,392
When Augustus Hill died,

94
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,265
we thought we lost him
forever, but we didn't.

95
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,998
He wrote a book

96
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,472
about his life here...

97
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,771
about your lives,

98
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,108
and Kareem Said's
last great act

99
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,081
was to get Augustus'
book published.

100
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,675
Now when Kareem died,

101
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,084
the book could've
died with him,

102
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,315
but it didn't

103
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,792
because of the hard work
and dedication of these men.

104
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,227
I want you all to share
in their triumph.

105
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,899
Here you go.

106
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,480
Fuck, man.
All right, already.

107
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,349
- Quit fuckin' with me!
- Whoa, Rawls, take it easy.

108
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,183
You have any idea how much
this machine costs?

109
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,121
No. I'm doing
something wrong.

110
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,386
Don't touch it,
I'll get Arif.

111
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,332
We got big trouble. One of the guys
are having problems

112
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,130
with something
I couldn't help him with.

113
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,137
You might want to go take
a few minutes and check it out.

114
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,867
I don't have a few minutes, Jamal.
You can see that, can't you?

115
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,137
Would it help to hire someone
from outside to do the accounting?

116
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,305
And pay them
with what?

117
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,679
See that figure on the bottom right, right
there?

118
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,844
That's our gross so far,
1/5 of what it should be.

119
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,411
With all due respect
to Kareem Said,

120
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,447
taking on Hill's book pro bono
wasn't a sound business plan.

121
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,324
Us paying minimum wage
is the problem.

122
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,386
A small cut, which would
still be far above

123
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,830
what prisoners usually make,
might be the best solution.

124
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,629
And defeat the whole purpose
of this operation? No.

125
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,228
What is the purpose exactly?
To run a successful company

126
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,171
or humiliate
Burr Redding?

127
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,612
Prisoner
number 0-1-R-9-3-4,

128
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,646
Reginald Rawls...

129
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,392
convicted January 10th, 2001...
aggravated assault.

130
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,237
Sentence... 12 years,
up for parole in four.

131
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:48,241
First, telemarketing,
now bookbinding?

132
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,874
Not exactly the kind of prison
life you hear about on the street.

133
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,613
All right, game's over.

134
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,987
I want you two back with me
in Degenhart's company.

135
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,116
Poet put you up to this,

136
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,926
following him to work
for the Muslims.

137
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:09,196
Well, in case you forgot,
you answer to me.

138
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,226
We do?

139
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,604
Kenaniah, we still answer
to Mr. Redding here?

140
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:19,202
You two begged like bitches
to get a place in my clan.

141
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,244
I gave you shelter.

142
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,079
I showed you the ropes.

143
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,880
And this is
the thanks I get.

144
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,514
Please. We were
your foot soldiers,

145
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,525
day and night
running tits and shit.

146
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,187
Now you turn around
and want us to do work

147
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,356
that's just plain
fuckin' work?

148
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,389
Kiss my ass, old man.

149
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:56,313
- Preach that shit, Reggie.
- You know it, nigga.

150
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,872
Give me that,
give me that.

151
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,220
So Redding,
you wanted to see me.

152
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,723
About what?

153
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,625
Well, when I told you fellas
I was giving up the tit trade,

154
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:13,121
- you didn't believe me.
- No, we didn't.

155
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,895
Well, now you can see
that my words are righteous.

156
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,632
I got involved in this
telemarketing business

157
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
to keep my boys
from slinging...

158
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,367
but it's not working,
and I need your help.

159
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,246
If you see Poet, Rawls
or any of the others

160
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,479
dealing, I want
you to squash 'em...

161
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,918
squash 'em hard.

162
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,751
You want us to kill
your own men?

163
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,088
Not kill, demobilize.

164
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,687
Weaken 'em until they have
to come back to me.

165
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,794
Looks like you got
yourself a deal.

166
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,742
Yo, I am done toting
and lifting heavy machinery.

167
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,219
We need to get back
to slinging drugs.

168
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,551
I hear ya, Reggie,

169
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,818
but the timing
ain't right.

170
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,227
Man, I would love to take
that dago down.

171
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,459
You will, yo, you will.
But not yet, though.

172
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,626
We got to play this real smooth,
real smooth.

173
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,761
Hey, guys.

174
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,296
- Y'all want ball?
- Drop dead, Omar.

175
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,412
Prisoner number
0-3-l-4-6-2,

176
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,387
Lemuel Idzik...

177
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,118
convicted
February 2nd, 2003...

178
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,625
murder
in the second degree.

179
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,423
Sentence...
life imprisonment

180
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,191
without the possibility
of parole.

181
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,961
You'll be staying here in "J,"
at least temporarily,

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,834
until we see how the rest of the population
adjusts to you around.

183
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,169
There's your nest.

184
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,637
Good to see you
there, Warden.

185
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,682
I'm Alvin Yood.

186
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,936
Friendly type, huh?

187
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,118
Arif,

188
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,383
I just heard the motherfucker
that killed Said is coming to Oz.

189
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,554
- He's already here.
- Here?

190
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,154
Well, what we gonna do?

191
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,132
- Do?
- Yeah, what are we gonna do?

192
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,897
- We gotta whack his white ass.
- No!

193
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,929
What's the matter, Arif,
ain't you got the balls?

194
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,999
I promised the warden
no harm would come to Idzik,

195
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,704
and no Muslim
would seek revenge.

196
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,549
Like I said, no balls.

197
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,414
Listen to me,

198
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,181
I saw Kareem Said
get shot.

199
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,315
I held him
in my arms as he died.

200
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,188
The last words
he said were,

201
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,456
"Don't harm him."

202
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,692
Now, as hard as it is
not to do something,

203
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,167
I will respect and obey
the minister's wishes,

204
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,328
and you will do the same.

205
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,307
Don't you be ordering me
around, motherfucker.

206
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,475
You don't own me,
you understand?

207
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,711
Not one little bit of me.

208
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,587
Mail call.

209
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,067
- How's the new guy?
- Marathon talker.

210
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:23,242
The brotherhood is grateful
for what you did to Said.

211
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,676
Them Muslim bastards
start to hassle you,

212
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,880
you just let me know,
we'll take care of them.

213
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,880
- I am a Jew.
- A Jew?

214
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,831
Well, I've always said there's
some good use for you people.

215
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,558
So explain,

216
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,299
why the fuck did you kill him?
Some Israeli-Palestine thing?

217
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,933
Water. Cold water.

218
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,772
Huh?

219
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,404
You put cold water in a...

220
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,142
let's say a teapot,

221
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,515
turn the stove on,

222
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,520
the water
gets hot, right?

223
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,614
At some point it gets
as hot as it will ever be,

224
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,149
blistering. Meanwhile,
the stove is off,

225
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,662
the water
starts to cool,

226
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,689
until eventually
it's cold.

227
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,099
That's the way things
work in the universe,

228
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,867
cold, hot, cold.

229
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,910
You should've
pleaded insanity.

230
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,955
Omar, you wanted
to see me?

231
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,221
Yes, sir.

232
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,292
I am hereby
and officially requesting

233
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,960
a face-to-face meeting
with Lemuel Idzik.

234
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,129
Ah, that would be a no.

235
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,332
- Wait, wait, wait, hear me out.
- He killed Said.

236
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,603
I'm not gonna give you
a chance to return the favor.

237
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,633
- I'm not gonna hurt him.
- That's what you say now,

238
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,907
but what will you say
when you stand over his dead body

239
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,347
with a shank in your hand?
Not gonna happen.

240
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,913
Fuck!

241
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,177
So if forgiveness
is so good for us,

242
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,616
- why don't we do it more?
- Same reason I don't eat tofu.

243
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,210
- It tastes like shit.
- There are two reasons

244
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,553
we hold back.
First, accountability...

245
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,958
as long as we're still in pain,
we need someone to blame.

246
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,552
What can you do
with all that pain

247
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,530
if you've let the bastard
off the hook?

248
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,226
Second, identity...

249
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,235
without this rage
consuming me,

250
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,103
without this resentment,
this bitterness,

251
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,506
who am I?

252
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,238
And finally, the Correctional
Officers Association

253
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,736
is holding their annual awards dinner and
banquet here later this month.

254
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,375
How come we always have
to host these fuckin' things?

255
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,317
That attitude,
Claire, is why

256
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,151
you probably won't be taking
home a trophy again this year.

257
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,150
Don't forget,
it's black tie and evening gown.

258
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,161
Okay, let's make
a good showing.

259
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,720
All right, that's
all for today.

260
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,756
I can't wear an evening gown.
I don't even own one.

261
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,104
- Warden, can I have a minute?
- Sure.

262
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,339
I've been a C.O.
A lot of years,

263
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,817
and in that time I've done
some things I regret.

264
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,877
We all have, Sean.
Occupational hazard.

265
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,721
Yeah, well, what I mean is
that we spend a lot of time

266
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,318
trying to get the prisoners
to rat each other out,

267
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,022
yet when it comes to us,
there's this...

268
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,123
- code of silence.
- Which you're about to break.

269
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,633
Yeah.

270
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,899
I don't envy you
right now.

271
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,540
- Who?
- Dave Brass.

272
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,139
- He killed Carlos Martinez?
- No, no, no,

273
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,173
but Dave lied about talking
to Martinez the night he died.

274
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,311
There was no
death bed confession.

275
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,514
Martinez never implicated
Morales

276
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,920
in the cutting
of Dave's tendons.

277
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,484
That's the real reason you asked me
to move Morales to the hospital.

278
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,792
- I still think the dink is guilty.
- But there's no proof.

279
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,890
We dumped him
in solitary unjustly.

280
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,796
Worse...

281
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,829
Dave, Claire Howell
and myself, we...

282
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,433
we're the ones who cut up
Morales' ankles.

283
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,681
I suspected
that Brass was involved

284
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,552
and that Howell
allowed it to happen.

285
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,251
- But you, Sean...
- Dave was my pal, you know?

286
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,920
Morales fucked up
his life forever.

287
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,064
Okay.
Thank you.

288
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,068
That's it, "Thanks"?

289
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,538
I'll discipline
the three of you, but...

290
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,507
how exactly,
I don't know yet.

291
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,934
- Sean?
- Yeah?

292
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,844
It takes balls,
what you just did.

293
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,873
Well, I didn't
become a zoo keeper

294
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,578
just to behave
like one of the animals.

295
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,753
Put it into your mouth.

296
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,785
Morales.

297
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,267
I'm releasing you
from solitary, permanently,

298
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,270
putting you
back in Emerald City.

299
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,864
- Why?
- I don't need to give a reason.

300
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,897
That might make me
think twice.

301
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,603
All right,
forget the why.

302
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,646
Hey, Warden,

303
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,707
what do you know
about nurse Grace?

304
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,917
Know about her?
Nothing,

305
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,717
except she's worked
here for years.

306
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,884
If I were you,
I'd check her background.

307
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,486
What? She's medically
incompetent?

308
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,656
I'm afraid.

309
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,327
Afraid? You?

310
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,497
- Of her?
- Yeah.

311
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,497
Must be the medication
you're on.

312
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,850
Hey, Rebadow.

313
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,582
What do you want?

314
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,615
Didn't I give you
all the money

315
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,220
that was left
from that lottery?

316
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,662
Too late
to save my grandson.

317
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,928
You blame me,
but you shouldn't.

318
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,128
- Who then?
- Morales.

319
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,163
He had Martinez cut me,
which screwed with my head,

320
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,004
which made me take off
with your winnings.

321
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,101
He's the bastard
you should hate.

322
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,214
There's room in my heart
for both of you.

323
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,909
Yeah?

324
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,317
Well, Morales is on his way
back to Em City,

325
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,719
and I got fined
and suspended...

326
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,724
a solid month...
and no pay, no benefits.

327
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,350
You think
I can afford that?

328
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,624
I just got married,
for Christ's sake!

329
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,653
I'll repeat my question.

330
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,495
What do you want?

331
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,934
For me to feel sorry for you?
No chance.

332
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,838
Fuck you, Murphy.

333
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,322
So, you happy?

334
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,953
Brass gets his ass
handed to him,

335
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,088
we lose
a week's vacation.

336
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,089
All for what?
Enrique-fucking-Morales?

337
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,295
For the truth, Howell,
for justice.

338
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:02,705
Justice?!
Justice, my pink ass!

339
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,866
Oh, call the blood banks.

340
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,742
Here comes another
bleeding heart.

341
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,747
- Leo told me all the gory details.
- I'm sorry, Tim.

342
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,189
- You're sorry?
- I bring you into Oz

343
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,752
because we've known each other
since sixth grade,

344
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,492
because you're the one person
in my entire life

345
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,557
that I can trust

346
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,764
with my life,
if necessary.

347
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,272
But then, see, I find out
I can't trust you,

348
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,798
that you're just
another thick-headed,

349
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,710
red-neck slug who uses
his badge as a weapon.

350
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,679
You're right,
you're absolutely right.

351
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,944
Don't you fuckin'
agree with me!

352
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,713
I'm telling you
to fuck off!

353
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,986
Listen, I've betrayed
your trust.

354
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,117
If you don't see me
getting it back,

355
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,128
maybe I should just
transfer out of Em City.

356
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,926
- What?!
- Maybe I should just quit.

357
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,297
No. Jesus!
Jesus!

358
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,325
Stop being
so fuckin' remorseful!

359
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,736
- You don't want me to be remorseful?
- No... yes!

360
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,242
We're going to dinner tonight.
You're paying.

361
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,383
Okay.

362
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,686
Sean, I'm proud of you,

363
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,719
that you stepped forward.

364
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,029
It means...
I can still trust you.

365
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,667
Morales?

366
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,670
Morales,

367
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,843
I'm sorry to disturb you.

368
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,988
That sedative I gave you
was pretty strong, huh?

369
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,683
Yeah.

370
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,748
It's a precaution.

371
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:04,319
You're a big fella.
I didn't want to struggle.

372
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,330
Struggle?

373
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,333
Martinez was so weak.
He couldn't fight me,

374
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,358
but you...

375
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,502
Say your prayers,
Enrique.

376
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,133
- No, don't.
- You're just like Martinez,

377
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,735
a nasty man
who deserves to die.

378
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,549
- Knock, knock.
- Hi.

379
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,751
Can you say,
"Who's there?"

380
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,819
Might be a while before she can
say "Agamemnon Busmalis."

381
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,559
Oh, God,
she's gorgeous.

382
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,662
Thank you.

383
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,164
Oh, that fresh smell
of baby skin...

384
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,801
in Oz of all places.

385
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,971
- Can I touch her?
- Of course.

386
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,851
- Can I keep her?
- How about we share?

387
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,155
Ruby needs a father,
Agamemnon,

388
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,129
and I need you back.

389
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,760
Agamemnon,
will you marry me?

390
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,270
What?

391
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,933
You're proposing
to me now?

392
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,432
- Is that a yes?
- I think so.

393
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,575
Yeah.

394
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,775
- Oh, my God, yes!
- Yeah.

395
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,841
Yes!

396
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,681
Oh, you little doll.
Little doll.

397
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,726
I can't work
in the library anymore.

398
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,856
What?
Why not?

399
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,889
I'd rather not get
into the specifics.

400
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,766
Given that I run this place,
I need specifics.

401
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,430
Something happen
I should know about?

402
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,635
- No.
- Trouble with other inmates?

403
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,610
- No.
- Is it Stella?

404
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,049
Are you two
having problems?

405
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,483
- No.
- Well, what is it then?

406
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,453
Did you forget
the fuckin' alphabet?

407
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,129
I don't wanna get
Robert in trouble,

408
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,134
but I thought
you should know.

409
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,626
It's not like Rebadow
to just stop showing up,

410
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,402
but he did come to me asking
to be switched to another job.

411
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,309
You have
any idea why?

412
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,471
No.

413
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,443
He's probably still
depressed about Alex Jr.

414
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,714
Who?

415
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,778
His grandson.

416
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,848
He died last year
of leukemia.

417
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,223
His grandson?
Of leukemia?

418
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,960
I didn't say anything
when I initially came to you.

419
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,125
I thought that the library
would be a good place

420
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,761
to distract his mind
from his misery.

421
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,964
Anyway, he'll be
there tomorrow.

422
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,175
So I did good by you
with "ball four"?

423
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,202
- I hit a homerun?
- I like the beaver shooting,

424
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,976
where the players drilled holes
in the doors of the hotel room

425
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,539
and watched
the stewardess fuckin'.

426
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,711
Yeah, well,
it's fun for the guys,

427
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,153
but how would you like
to have been on the other side?

428
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,157
What they did was
an invasion of privacy.

429
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,557
- Yeah, whatever.
- Whatever.

430
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:27,497
Now, this is a very
good book about women.

431
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,830
And I thought something
wilderness-based,

432
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,269
"Into Thin Air," might be
a nice antidote to Oz.

433
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,205
- I look like a fuckin' boy scout?
- Scout, no.

434
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,108
Boy, yes.

435
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,644
I'll just be a minute.

436
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,849
I'd like
to talk to you.

437
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,053
When I told you
about my breast cancer,

438
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,891
I wasn't asking you to watch me
waste away and die, Robert.

439
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:01,126
I don't need you for that,
if that's what you're afraid of.

440
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,562
I know about Alex Jr.

441
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,968
This isn't that.

442
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,344
I know you're thinking...

443
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,077
you can't go through
the grief again, but...

444
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,348
what if you're missing the chance
to go through the joy,

445
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:26,255
the joy of being there for someone
who is going to make it?

446
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,454
According to Blake,
they go hand in hand,

447
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,625
joy and grief..."piping down
the valleys wild." Remember?

448
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,098
Stop being an asshole.

449
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,012
If she's talking to you, old man,
show some respect, talk back.

450
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,108
That's enough, Pablo. Take
your book, we're done for today.

451
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:33,415
70 times 77. Jesus said
that's how many times

452
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,483
you're supposed
to forgive your brother.

453
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,552
Hank and I are still
working on seven.

454
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,394
Meanwhile, an innocent man
nailed to a cross

455
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,026
with iron spikes
says while dying,

456
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,036
"Forgive them, Father.

457
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,005
They know not what
they do."

458
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,373
Hind of raises the stakes
for the rest of us, huh?

459
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,673
Officer Schwartzmyer says

460
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,684
on the night of the murder
you started screaming.

461
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,743
I had a bad reaction
to the medicine.

462
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,345
As he came over
to check you out,

463
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,449
someone snuck in the private room
and stabbed Mayor Loewen.

464
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,653
The medicine was
giving me hives.

465
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,026
Mr. Kelsch,
Dr. Nathan tells us

466
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,497
you weren't having a negative
reaction to the medicine.

467
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,363
I couldn't stop itching.

468
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,767
You wanna know
what I think? I think

469
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,966
You were paid to distract Officer
Schwartzmyer from his post.

470
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,372
The scratching was
driving me crazy.

471
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,570
That makes
you guilty of murder.

472
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,841
That means you go
to death row.

473
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,075
Huh?
Death row?

474
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,878
For hives?

475
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,629
Okay, Brandt,
here's the deal.

476
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,757
We now know you're guilty
of killing Wilson Loewen.

477
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,097
That's a lie.

478
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,125
We have statements
from two of the other inmates

479
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,762
who were in the ward
that night.

480
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,501
They say they saw you
get out of bed

481
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,101
- and go into Loewen's room.
- They're lying.

482
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,771
We also have a confession
from Lionel Kelsch who says

483
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,441
you offered him $1,000
to distract the officer on duty.

484
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,109
He's a liar.

485
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,981
Okay, we'll play it
your way.

486
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,112
You have the right
to remain silent.

487
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,951
Aryans are gonna be pissed
when they hear

488
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,514
you're guilty
of killing their hero.

489
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,083
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

490
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,493
Without my protection,
you'll be dead within the hour.

491
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,827
You have the right to a lawyer
before speaking to me.

492
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,095
All right.

493
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,329
All right, all right.
L...

494
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,338
I'll tell you
who hired me.

495
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,533
It was that C.O.,

496
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,134
what was his name?
Johnson.

497
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,685
Johnson,
how's it going?

498
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,417
Not bad, sir,
and you?

499
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,584
The usual brouhaha.

500
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,186
Hey, I hear you just
bought a car,

501
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,856
uh... Jaguar.

502
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,798
- Yep.
- A beautiful automobile.

503
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,324
Pretty pricey
on a C.O.'s salary.

504
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,361
My wife's
maiden aunt kicked.

505
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,067
She left us
a little dough.

506
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,938
Nice.

507
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,843
Willy Brandt...

508
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,439
- What, sir?
- Willy Brandt confessed

509
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,382
to the murder
of Wilson Loewen.

510
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,386
Congratulations.

511
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,513
How did you manage to get
that thing to spill?

512
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,546
The truth?

513
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,285
We lied.

514
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,557
We told Brandt that
we had two witnesses,

515
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,030
which we don't, and that
his partner confessed,

516
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,931
which he didn't.

517
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:33,164
- Brilliant.
- Oh, here's the good part.

518
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,172
Brandt claims
that you offered

519
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,766
to pay him $5,000
to waste Wilson Loewen.

520
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,801
Not that I believe him
or anything.

521
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,836
No, sir.

522
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,246
He's a lying
piece of shit.

523
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,148
Right.

524
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,745
Well,
good night.

525
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,288
Enjoy that car.

526
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,896
Hey, it's me.
We got a problem.

527
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,772
Glynn knows
I set up the murder.

528
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,709
What do you
want me to do?

529
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,238
Okay.

530
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,417
He brought the devil
in here, your son.

531
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,753
Do you hear me?

532
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,954
Your baby boy got
butt-fucked by Satan,

533
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,520
and now
we're all gonna burn,

534
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,555
you fuckin' bitch!

535
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,961
I'm an idiot.

536
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,667
I thought by talking
to the man who killed Timmy,

537
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,268
I would get to know
more about my boy,

538
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,245
that I'd understand how
he became the man he became.

539
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,441
Well, like I said,

540
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,712
Jaz Hoyt isn't very coherent
these days.

541
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,515
He's been ruled mentally insane
by the court of appeals.

542
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,681
Tomorrow they're moving him
up to the psych unit.

543
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,020
So what do I do now?

544
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,218
How do I calm this guilt
inside of me?

545
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,387
And don't
tell me to pray.

546
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,420
I've prayed so hard
my knees hurt.

547
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,491
Well, when praying stalls,
I usually try to imagine

548
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,163
what my dad would've done
in the situation.

549
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,106
That's an excellent idea.

550
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,405
Do you drink, father?

551
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,707
- Ah, sure.
- Good.

552
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,180
I'll go into town, I'll get us
a quart of Jameson's

553
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,842
and sit in the dark
and drink until dawn,

554
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,351
'cause that's how my dad would've
handled the situation.

555
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,083
- Uh, Mrs. Kirk, I-I...
- I'm joking, Father.

556
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:36,055
Call me Jessica.

557
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:40,291
- Call me Ray.
- Ray...

558
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,596
like a ray of sunshine.

559
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,803
I think what
I should do is...

560
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,469
what I should've done
when Timmy was alive,

561
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,140
and that's volunteer
to work at Oswald,

562
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,649
help men like my son

563
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,278
- become better people.
- Volunteer?

564
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,652
- What would you do?
- I'm a nurse.

565
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,782
I bet they could use some help
in the hospital ward.

566
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,883
Yes.

567
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,759
- You'll set that up for me?
- Of course.

568
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,787
Thank you.

569
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,469
I consider you
my really good friend.

570
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,249
Morning, kiddies.

571
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,809
Do I have to go
get more ECT?

572
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,821
Later.

573
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:41,120
Come on, Hoyt, time
to move you up to Psych.

574
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,024
Hoyt!

575
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,466
What the fuck?!
I'm bleeding.

576
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,603
He'll sleep.
I sedated him.

577
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,304
He's got no cuts
on his forehead.

578
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,746
What's causing the bleeding?

579
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,751
A rare condition
called hematidrosis.

580
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,653
Underneath the skin there are
these tiny blood vessels,

581
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,088
capillaries.

582
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,059
When people are stressed,
they sweat, right?

583
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,358
Well, sometimes
under extreme stress

584
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,126
the capillaries
hemorrhage,

585
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,759
releasing small amounts
of blood into the sweat glands.

586
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,827
Hoyt is literally
sweating blood.

587
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,401
"And being in fear,
he prayed more earnestly,

588
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,410
and his sweat became
like great drops of blood,

589
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,435
which fell
upon the ground."

590
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,749
Luke 22:44, the agony
of Christ in Gethsemane.

591
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,754
Jesus and Jaz,

592
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,520
I didn't know they had
so much in common.

593
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,296
What's the matter
with him?

594
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,828
Side effects
of the electric shock.

595
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,905
I threw up on myself.

596
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:09,140
Oh, poor Cyril.

597
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,909
Clean him up
and then admit him.

598
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,381
I was gonna give him
some Emetrol

599
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,883
and send him
back to death row.

600
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,442
He spent enough time
up there.

601
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,885
He could use a change
of scenery.

602
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,651
All right, but I'm putting
him in restraints.

603
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,723
Hey, Gloria.
Hey, thanks a lot

604
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,668
for letting my brother, chill out
in the hospital ward.

605
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,763
- It means a lot to me.
- Well, that's okay.

606
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah.
Hey, we...

607
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,570
we just
heard that...

608
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,602
yeah, his latest appeal
has been denied

609
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:46,138
and... the lawyer...

610
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,981
is gonna plead his case
to the State Supreme Court

611
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,988
but, you know, unless
a fuckin' miracle happens...

612
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,014
I think Cyril's going
to be executed next week.

613
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,900
I have to go.

614
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,905
Hey, Gloria...

615
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,236
I never stopped
loving you,

616
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,608
not for a second.

617
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,249
Excuse me.

618
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,759
Excuse me.

619
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,955
Excuse me.

620
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,631
Don't you fuckin'
ignore me.

621
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:42,105
You think because I'm slow
I don't know what's going on.

622
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,607
I have to go
to the bathroom.

623
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,212
Listen to me,
you fuckin' asshole,

624
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,009
I'm gonna shit
in my pants.

625
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,243
Help me.

626
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,714
Too late.

627
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,928
Hey, you're gonna
leave me lying here

628
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,957
in my own shit?

629
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,002
Hey!

630
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,771
- What's the matter?
- I had an accident.

631
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,435
Not again.

632
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,940
Machelo.

633
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,414
Can you give me a hand
over here, please?

634
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,729
Okay, I'm here.
What's so urgent?

635
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,062
Mr. Neema,

636
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,229
your reputation
on the street is...

637
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,262
well, it's massive.

638
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,736
Back in the day with
the Black Panthers thing,

639
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,303
and since then with
the community development...

640
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,815
I know my own resume.
Get to the point.

641
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,646
Well, you see, sir,

642
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,209
we've been a little
leaderless lately.

643
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,213
Burr Redding's off on some
telemarketing ego trip.

644
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,591
Yeah, and you want me
to take over.

645
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,495
Shit, yeah.

646
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,224
You fellas know
why I'm in Oz?

647
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,465
For kidnapping
or some such.

648
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,703
I picked up my daughter
from day care.

649
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,739
My ex-wife was intending
to leave this country,

650
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,775
thereby depriving me
of my rights to see my child,

651
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,481
and I love my children,
gentlemen,

652
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,389
every single one,
and I got 16.

653
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,791
Maybe it's your turn
to get to the point.

654
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,763
None of my children
do drugs,

655
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,096
sell drugs
or hang in gangs.

656
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,227
Each lives a life
of their own choosing,

657
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,260
contributing
as best they can

658
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,273
to make a better world.

659
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,401
My children are my pride

660
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,412
because they make
me proud.

661
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,415
So rather than use
this classroom

662
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,510
as a place
to plot your plans,

663
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,046
use it for
a real purpose...

664
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,049
to learn.

665
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,528
End of sermon.

666
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,588
End of discussion.

667
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:36,670
Hey, stranger, haven't seen
much of you lately.

668
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,080
- You've been busy with the play...
- Yes.

669
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,879
- Your boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

670
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,752
Jahfree Neema. I see you here,
I see you there,

671
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,756
laughing
and whispering.

672
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,020
- It's very sweet, very intimate.
- Ryan, come on.

673
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,459
What? You gonna tell me
I'm imagining it,

674
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,360
- that my eyes deceive me?
- No.

675
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,921
You asked me
to be nice to the guy,

676
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,229
I tried, he blew me off.

677
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,725
I know you think he's some sort
of hotshot savior and all,

678
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,501
but to me he's just
another fuckin' wanker.

679
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,132
You two enjoy
yourselves.

680
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,076
Meanwhile, my little
brother's gonna die.

681
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,171
- Ryan.
- What?!

682
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:13,547
Promise me you won't do
anything to harm Jahfree.

683
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,644
Oh, gee, Ma,

684
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,713
you really think I'm capable
of something like that?

685
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,390
Neema,

686
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,868
we haven't had much of a chance
to talk since you arrived...

687
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,770
that's probably because we have
nothing to say to each other.

688
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,468
Well, look, I know
on the outside you and me,

689
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,103
- were never that friendly, but...
- Friendly?

690
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,978
Redding, you are
anathema to me.

691
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,281
See, there you go
using them big words,

692
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,877
think you're going
to curl me, but it don't.

693
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,581
For the past
30-something years,

694
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,954
you've been supplying
the children of our community

695
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,721
with lethal drugs
while I have fought

696
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,387
to keep those
same children safe.

697
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:02,422
And now, because we both find
ourselves in this clapshack,

698
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,957
you want to believe
that we have a bond.

699
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,800
- We don't.
- We do!

700
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,601
I've seen
the error of my ways,

701
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,437
and I'm trying
to correct them.

702
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,467
I don't believe you.

703
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,306
You know, Burr,
that Neema,

704
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,614
he's a pompous
piece of shit, man.

705
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,985
I say it's time he learns
who's the boss around here.

706
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,616
You want him dead,
O'Reily?

707
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,558
I wouldn't weep
if he was.

708
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:34,624
If you really want
to do Neema some harm,

709
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,225
tie him to your
mother's crime.

710
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,963
What do you mean?

711
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,699
You're a clever boy,
you figure that one out.

712
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,336
Who's the hardest person
of all to forgive?

713
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,847
Oneself.

714
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:55,113
The demons inside,
they laugh at the thought.

715
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,813
When you forgive
some other guy,

716
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,345
he's not likely to turn you down,
say, "fuck that."

717
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,152
Tryin' to forgive
yourself, though,

718
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,886
it's "fuck that"
all the time.

719
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,952
10 years go by, you still can't
let yourself off the hook.

720
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:08,829
15 years, 20, 40.
You gonna take that grudge

721
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,333
against yourself
to the grave?

722
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,062
You gonna carry it
for eternity?

723
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,611
Well, well, well,
Agent Taylor,

724
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,011
- are you here to visit me?
- Fuck you, Keller.

725
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,914
Aww, G-man,

726
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,918
don't get grumpy.

727
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,977
You're the one who made
the deal with Heekin.

728
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,613
You're the one
who got him to fib.

729
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,419
He saw you
dump the body.

730
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,586
Wasn't it J. Edgar Hoover who said,
"Cheaters never prosper"?

731
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,526
Careful there, sir.

732
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,125
You killed
two other men, Keller,

733
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,227
and I'm gonna get
you for one of them.

734
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,980
Henry Stanton?
I'm Tobias Beecher.

735
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,579
Sister Peter Marie
suggested I come see you.

736
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,647
- You're doing pro bono work?
- Yeah, that's right.

737
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,489
Helping the prisoners
with legal shit and such.

738
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,792
I hurt my back doing sanitation
duty a few months ago.

739
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,028
Dr. Nathan told me not to do
anything too strenuous.

740
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,194
I told my C.O.'s
and they put me right back

741
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,694
to work again 'cause they think
I'm faking, but I'm not.

742
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,606
In fact, they give me
harder work.

743
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:29,373
I complain to my unit manager,
nothing changes.

744
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,643
And the other day
I screwed up my back again.

745
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,877
Well, off the top
of my head,

746
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,547
it appears the C.O.'s
violated your rights

747
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,683
under the Eighth Amendment...
deliberate indifference.

748
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,489
Let me talk to Dr. Nathan,
the officers involved,

749
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,894
and Warden Glynn.
Let me see what I can do.

750
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,263
Meanwhile, take it easy.
Back injuries suck.

751
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,597
Thanks a lot, man.

752
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,899
Stanton is not lying, Leo.

753
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,202
I gave him the proper medical
documentation three times.

754
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,677
Okay, the C.O.'s screwed up.
They will be reprimanded.

755
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,576
That's not good enough.

756
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,604
I've got a rock-solid case
here, Warden.

757
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,049
- If we go to court, I'll win.
- What do you want?

758
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,350
Full physical rehab for Stanton
at the prison's expense,

759
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,551
and a guarantee that he'll be
assigned light duty tasks.

760
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,018
- Okay.
- And those two C.O.'s fired.

761
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,327
- Beecher.
- Gone, today.

762
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,665
- The union will fight this.
- Let the union take the heat.

763
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,296
All right, they're fired.
I'm busy.

764
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,909
- You're good at this, Tobias.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

765
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,715
So how are you adjusting
to life after death row?

766
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,349
I'm bored.
Bored of the everyday,

767
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,849
bored with shaving,
brushing my teeth,

768
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,727
taking a shit,
wiping my ass.

769
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,732
You know what?

770
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,757
I don't think
you're bored.

771
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,001
I think
you miss Tobias.

772
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,841
Well, he's turned
into a real firebrand.

773
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,745
No sooner does he get
my sentence overturned

774
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,511
than he's out taking on the case
of some other jamoke.

775
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,281
He's found a lot of joy
in helping others.

776
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,687
You might want to try
the same thing.

777
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,122
And how would I do that,
sister? I'm not a lawyer.

778
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,030
Well...

779
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,694
who besides Beecher
do you care about?

780
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,369
My ex-wives,
I guess.

781
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,300
Start there.

782
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:46,612
You know something, sister,
you just gave me a great idea.

783
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,483
Thanks.

784
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,824
- Socks.
- Yeah, I know how you are.

785
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,657
You wear them
until they fall off your feet.

786
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,526
Exactly.

787
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,392
So what's the latest
from the outside world?

788
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,461
Kids are great,

789
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,406
Harry...

790
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,807
actually hugged me
yesterday.

791
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,709
Sweet.

792
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,737
I'd like
to meet your kids.

793
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,114
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

794
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,521
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, definitely.

795
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,457
You know, you know,
just not right away though.

796
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,718
Been drinking?

797
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,522
Not a drop.

798
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,795
Went to a cocktail party
the other night

799
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,769
and passed
with flying colors.

800
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,967
Good boy. And Holly's
teacher, how's she?

801
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,607
Why do you ask that?

802
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,612
I don't know,

803
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,137
you're the one who's
mentioned her a couple times.

804
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,149
You know, actually,

805
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,981
- to be honest, Chris...
- Yes!

806
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,014
Let's be honest.

807
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,525
Marian and I
have been dating.

808
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,791
You fuck her yet?

809
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,360
- Chris.
- Be honest.

810
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,463
Yes.

811
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:21,102
Good for you,
you sexy motherfucker.

812
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,303
You're pissed.

813
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,907
I'm not.

814
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,941
Be honest.

815
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,791
You want a slice
of truth?

816
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,698
- I killed Franklin Winthrop.
- What?

817
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,200
Bitch kills your dad,
bitch gotta die.

818
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,339
Are you trying to get
sent back to death row?

819
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,712
I covered my tracks.

820
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,546
- Shit.
- Toby, look,

821
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,111
I'm telling you this...
I'm telling you this...

822
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,653
I'm not bragging.
I'm not trying to upset you.

823
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,528
I'm telling you this 'cause
I need you to do me a favor.

824
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,933
My ex-wife, Bonnie,

825
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:25,032
she's been diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

826
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,704
She's dying, Toby.

827
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,208
And the only hope
that she's got is this drug,

828
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,515
it's called oxaliplatin.

829
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,716
And the problem is that
it's illegal in this country,

830
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,556
so I contacted
this guy I know who...

831
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:47,154
he just... he peddles
in these kind of illegal drugs.

832
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,792
All I need you to do
is just meet him,

833
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,462
take the oxaliplatin
to Bonnie.

834
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,398
- I can't.
- Why the fuck not?

835
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,773
I'd be violating
my parole.

836
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,904
Bullshit, I'm asking
you to take a small package

837
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,040
in your pocket
from point "A" to point "B."

838
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,574
I can't.

839
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,384
Bonnie is dying.

840
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,085
- Chris...
- I love you.

841
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,822
- Don't...
- I know that you love me.

842
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:25,457
I'm begging you,
please.

843
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,231
Toby, I'm begging you.

844
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,863
All right.
Give me the address.

845
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,882
I gotta go.

846
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,681
Toby, you'll see,
this is all for the best.

847
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,889
It's all
for the best, Toby.

848
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,485
Yes, is Detective Weber
there?

849
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,519
I got a tip for him.

850
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,765
The sale of illegal
pharmaceuticals.

851
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,431
A man stands in the cemetery
reading a letter he wrote,

852
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,906
finally forgiving
his long-dead father.

853
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,375
The mother of a girl
killed by a drunk driver

854
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,708
is wracked with fantasies
of retaliation.

855
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,546
Your boyfriend begs you
for one more chance.

856
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,178
You say to a mirror
you're done hating yourself.

857
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,085
But you know you're not.

858
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,749
Maybe instead
of forgive and forget,

859
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,088
it should be
forgive and remember.

860
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,889
Remember that you might
wake up tomorrow

861
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,158
and have to forgive
all over again

862
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,165
and again and again,

863
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,759
the way the heart keeps
beating like a drum.

864
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,200
Forgive.

865
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,794
I can't.

866
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,068
You can.

867
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,233
Forgive.

868
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,039
Forgive. I can't.

869
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,238
You can.

870
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,348
Forgive.

871
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,060
Same old story...

872
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,395
I got fucked in the ass.

873
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,600
Sit down.

874
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,842
Sit the fuck down.

875
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,388
All right, guys,
welcome to Oz.

876
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,084
Here's
the procedure.
