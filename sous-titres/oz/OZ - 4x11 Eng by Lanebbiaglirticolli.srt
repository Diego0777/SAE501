1
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:38,810
Most prisons
manufacture things:

2
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:41,245
license plates, clothes,
computer chips.

3
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,648
ln Oz, we do one thing
better than anybody:

4
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:47,983
revenge.

5
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:50,012
Yeah, we churn out
revenge

6
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,388
with greater precision
than a Ford assembly line.

7
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,485
We're world renowned.

8
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,359
And l'm happy
to say for us,

9
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,160
revenge is
a growth industry.

10
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,087
What the fuck are
you all looking at?

11
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:26,320
All right, warden
wants to see you.

12
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,896
We believe you arranged
to have Bian Yixue killed.

13
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,304
And your belief is
based on what?

14
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,002
On Bian coming to me
and saying that you threatened him.

15
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:45,443
McManus, do l look
stupid to you?

16
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,415
You warned me if anything happened to
those illegals l'd be held accountable.

17
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,850
And then the next day l
go out and grease the guy?

18
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,478
Fuck that!

19
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,081
Maybe you grease him assuming l'll think
you're too smart to.

20
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:00,092
And maybe somebody
set me up.

21
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:02,390
We have no evidence.

22
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,829
Only the word
of a dead man.

23
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:16,142
Thanks for arranging
my stay in the cage.

24
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:19,145
l ain't gonna forget it.

25
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:24,011
So much for fucking Plan A.

26
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,314
And that's why they
call it Plan A, Chucky,

27
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:29,254
'cause there's
still a Plan B, C, D,

28
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,052
all the way to fucking Z
if we need it.

29
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,582
We ain't got time to go through
the whole fucking alphabet.

30
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:37,085
This cocksucker's gonna
make a move on us, and soon.

31
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,465
Hey, yo, Glynn.
My shower don't work, man.

32
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,772
l'm fucking stinking
in here, man. Come on, man!

33
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,869
Warden, l got some
big news for you.

34
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:56,849
You gotta hear me out.
l got serious 411 here.

35
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:58,578
Warden!

36
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,680
You gotta let me out.

37
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,247
l gotta talk to you.
Can you hear?

38
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,884
You wanted to see me?

39
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,020
l've got a proposition.

40
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:12,259
- Have you padded him down?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,460
Close the door,
but stay close by.

42
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,731
All right.

43
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,669
What?

44
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,670
l know me and you we've had
some bad shit between us, right?

45
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:33,209
And l know you're planning on keeping
me in solitary for the rest of my life.

46
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,916
See, but l can't be in solitary
for the rest of my life

47
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:39,687
'cause l'll be
a fucking zombie,

48
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:43,685
- especially after being on the outside.
- Get to the point.

49
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,893
Put me back in Em City,
and in return

50
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,834
l'll be your eyes
and l'll be your ears.

51
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,427
- An informant?
- Yeah.

52
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,497
Whatever you need to know,
l'll find it out.

53
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,772
- And your loyalty to El Norte?
- Fuck 'em.

54
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,075
lt was fucking Hernandez
who tried to get me killed,

55
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:01,808
put me in this
fucking shithole.

56
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:05,875
You are in this shithole because you
are the lowest form of animal life.

57
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,511
Do you understand me?

58
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,852
So your answer's no?

59
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,249
My answer's yes.

60
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,386
You're also
the perfect snitch.

61
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,611
You got busted going
into Mexico?

62
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,614
What are you,
stupid or what, Alvarez?

63
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,045
Spic and span, Alvarez.

64
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,643
Bring me back
some pussy, man.

65
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:56,158
Miguel Alvarez. l was wondering
when you'd come to see me.

66
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,898
You know, a lot's
happened since l escaped.

67
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,873
Hernandez is dead.

68
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,637
And that makes you feel how?

69
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,009
Happy.

70
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,207
l hated that
fucking cocksucker.

71
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:12,378
Honesty.
l like honesty.

72
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,683
But l hear sometimes
you're too honest.

73
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,949
Look, man,
l don't give a fuck.

74
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,427
You in charge now.
That's all you, man.

75
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,589
l just want back in.

76
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,296
Tell me what l gotta do.

77
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,817
You see that man over there?
Burr Redding?

78
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:47,479
- Yeah.
- Kill him.

79
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,503
''Vengeance is mine,''
sayeth the Lord.

80
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,372
That's right.
According to the Bible,

81
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,173
revenge is the exclusive
property of God Almighty.

82
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,476
But if God admits
to using revenge,

83
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,482
and if God
can only do good,

84
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,950
does that mean
revenge is good?

85
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,317
Does that mean if
we are made in God's image,

86
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:25,415
then revenge becomes
not an act of hate, but a holy crusade?

87
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,824
A blessed thing?

88
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,125
All right.
Next item, Gloria.

89
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:33,155
The Wygert Corporation
has asked us to participate

90
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,463
in testing a new drug
that they're developing.

91
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,197
l'm against using
prisoners as guinea pigs.

92
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,171
Participation
would be voluntary.

93
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,900
Why would one of these
jackasses volunteer?

94
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,067
Benefit humanity?
Come on.

95
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,441
Wygert has also contacted
the governor,

96
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,072
who's agreed to reduce the sentences
of those prisoners

97
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,207
who cooperate in the experiment.

98
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,048
Jeez, what does this drug do?
Cure cancer?

99
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:56,317
No, it's actually designed to reduce
overcrowding in prisons.

100
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,347
lnstead of serving the time
he's sentenced,

101
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,586
the criminal would take a pill and age
the same number of years.

102
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,892
- Age? What do you mean, like grow old?
- Yes.

103
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,797
- This is real?
- Widespread use is a decade away,

104
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,563
but the tests we do here
will be the preliminary findings

105
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,502
upon which further research
will be based,

106
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,369
until the FDA approves.

107
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:17,172
Let me get this straight. lf a 20-
year-old is supposed to serve 30 years,

108
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,338
the drug physically transforms his body
into that of a 50-year-old?

109
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,177
Yes.

110
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,783
And he goes free.

111
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,958
There-- there are,
of course, dangers.

112
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:40,329
Several of the lab animals developed
heart problems, tumors, two died.

113
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,699
We're not completely sure
how the drug interacts with humans,

114
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:47,137
what rate you would age or if you would
age more years than you're supposed to.

115
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:50,836
The risk is great.
The sacrifice is great.

116
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,675
That's why the reward
is great, too.

117
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,108
Beecher,
you gonna sign up?

118
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:59,948
l don't know.

119
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,546
My daughter needs me
full time, but...

120
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,955
what's it gonna be like for her,
me coming out

121
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,891
looking older than my grandfather?

122
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:09,326
- You?
- No, l can't.

123
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,795
l'm in for life.

124
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,230
Only pill they could
give me is cyanide.

125
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,893
Norma and l are
getting married.

126
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,959
lt'd be nice to have
a normal life together,

127
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,665
but l'm afraid to die.

128
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,436
Yo, you stay in here,
you got no guarantees you live. l'm in.

129
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:25,808
Me too. l'll take a tumor
over this place any day.

130
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,746
The program is immoral.
lt's unnatural.

131
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:31,443
l know, but still,
my father had a stroke.

132
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:34,078
l'd like to be with him
before he dies.

133
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:48,026
- Oh!
- Hey, stud!

134
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:53,403
These kitchen whites
you're wearing are so sexy.

135
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,398
- l just love a man in uniform.
- No...

136
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:04,078
- Look, not here. Not now.
- Why? You got a headache?

137
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:06,950
l told you, we can't be
doing this anymore. lt's fucking crazy.

138
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:10,945
And l told you
it's up to me when we stop.

139
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,855
l could go
to the warden.

140
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:16,919
That'd sure stop me
from fucking you.

141
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:19,693
Of course, then l'd
have to find someone else,

142
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,893
someone as handsome as you.

143
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,835
God.

144
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:28,769
Hey, l know.
How about your brother, Cyril?

145
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,471
All right.

146
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,976
Today you're gonna
play the little Dutch boy

147
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,245
who stuck his finger
in the dike.

148
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,722
Mm-hmm.

149
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:49,220
Listen, Brenda.
The candy came yesterday.

150
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,924
lt was very good.

151
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,764
Let's go,
you fucking 'tard.

152
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:59,795
l especially liked
the chocolate with the nuts.

153
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:16,121
Let go of him, Cyril!

154
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,215
Break it up!
Break it up!

155
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,748
l'll fucking kill you!

156
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,852
Settle down!

157
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,678
Cyril's behavior continues
to be erratic.

158
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,681
l think that we should seriously
consider

159
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,683
transferring him
to the Conley lnstitute.

160
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,652
Separating him from his brother
will make him worse.

161
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,655
Yeah, but then he's not
gonna be our problem.

162
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,660
How about that rain check?

163
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:56,719
- Huh?
- Dinner? What are you doing tonight?

164
00:11:56,763 --> 00:12:00,426
l'm working late.
Dr. Prestopnik has a charity event.

165
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,958
- Tomorrow night?
- Maybe. We'll see.

166
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:14,473
Time is just so fucked up,
especially here in Oz.

167
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,505
You start thinking about
the time that you've wasted

168
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,143
and the time
that you have left to serve

169
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,813
and the time
that you have left to live.

170
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,283
Look...

171
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:28,122
l heard about what you're doing,
testing this new drug.

172
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:31,653
You gotta help me and my brother
get out of this place.

173
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:35,497
Please, Gloria,
make me old.

174
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,399
- O'Reily's not a viable candidate.
- Why not?

175
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,741
Because inmates in this program have
to be eligible for parole.

176
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,110
O'Reily's in for life,
and so is his brother.

177
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,274
l can petition the commissioner
to make an exception.

178
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,012
lf he's gonna listen to anybody about
the O'Reilys, it's gonna be me.

179
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,543
- Why the fuck do you want to help them?
- Humanitarian reasons.

180
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,182
Humanitarian and Ryan O'Reily don't
belong in the same sentence.

181
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,782
- Would you talk to her?
- Gloria--

182
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,090
l'm willing to give the guy a chance.
Why can't you?

183
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:05,655
- l've given him plenty of chances.
- Sometimes you're so blind.

184
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,256
You put O'Reily
in this program,

185
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,531
l'm gonna do everything
in my power to shut it the fuck down!

186
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,128
l swear to God!

187
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,842
Five of you will
be given the drug.

188
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:27,114
Five of you will get
a harmless placebo.

189
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:30,850
Once a week you'll
receive another dosage

190
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,687
and another complete
physical examination

191
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,091
in order to monitor
your health

192
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,096
and the progress
of your aging.

193
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,059
Are there any questions?

194
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,533
Let's go.

195
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,207
Take it, Cyril.

196
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,846
- l don't like the medicine.
- Come on. Take it.

197
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,869
My Uncle Bilbo
once said,

198
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,842
''Revenge is a dish
best served cold.''

199
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:27,141
Meaning, l guess,
if the person plotting revenge

200
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,807
goes into it
all hot and lathered,

201
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,907
he's likely
to go home hungry.

202
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,078
But the guy who approaches his goal
with a cool, clear eye,

203
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,054
he has himself
a feast.

204
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,115
Bon appetit.

205
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,489
Augustus Hill.
How you doing, brother?

206
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,592
What can l do for you, Vahue?
The answer is no.

207
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:52,001
Why you gonna be like that, man?
You and me got history.

208
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,570
- Yeah, and it's ancient.
- Ancient?

209
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:59,066
l remember when l first
got into Oz, l was your hero.

210
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:02,444
Should be talking about
the '95 Bulls game, boy.

211
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:06,417
- You scored 58 points.
- Yeah, you always been my hero, man.

212
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:08,886
That's me.
Fucking role model.

213
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,788
Well, l was still
naive then.

214
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:15,851
Back then l felt you were as good
a person as you are at basketball.

215
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,362
Oh hold on, man.

216
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,728
Look, during the riots,
l stepped up,

217
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:24,258
tried to save
Eugene Dobbins' life.

218
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,931
What'd l get for it?
An ass whooping and a transfer.

219
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,804
- Whatever.
- Fuck you, man.

220
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,674
Shit, ever since l been back in Oz, man,
l've been invisible.

221
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,271
Ain't been causing
nobody no trouble.

222
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,406
Now l'm up for parole.

223
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,112
While's you in here rotting,
l'll be back out.

224
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,676
Back on the court.

225
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,121
Why don't you
live with that, little man?

226
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:51,226
- Damn!
- What's the problem?

227
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,129
l'm trying to find
the name of that woman

228
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,224
who Jackson Vahue
beat up and almost raped.

229
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,600
- The one that got him sent to Oz.
- Why?

230
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:00,435
'Cause that cocksucker
Vahue is gonna sweet talk

231
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,441
the parole board
into letting him go free.

232
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:05,171
l want to make sure the girl gets
the chance to tell the board not to.

233
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,338
You still hate him
that much?

234
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,678
Hate? This ain't
about hate.

235
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:12,206
This is about justice.

236
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,082
He's supposed
to serve 1 2 years.

237
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,884
- He should serve the full 1 2 years.
- lf he gets out now,

238
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,220
he's got a chance of getting
his career back.

239
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:22,819
- Seven more years, he'll be too old.
- Exactly.

240
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,228
Sounds like hate to me.

241
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,296
Yes, Beverly Reed please?

242
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,397
Oh hi, Beverly.
Uh... huh?

243
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,909
Listen, who l am is not important.
What l have to say is.

244
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:44,438
Have you been notified that
Jackson Vahue is up for parole?

245
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,815
l didn't think so.

246
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,283
Yeah, l thought you'd have
something to say about that.

247
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,415
Yo, Jackson.

248
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,415
How'd that hearing go, man?

249
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:41,105
Oh shit,yo.

250
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:21,846
Yo, Smith. Yo, Smith.
My shower's still busted, man.

251
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:23,348
- Yo, yo.
- What the fuck?!

252
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,679
Yo, spiffy boy.
Yo, come on.

253
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:27,151
Hey, my nigger.

254
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,381
Hey, you watch my nigger.
You wouldn't get no bigger.

255
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,356
l just need five minutes
with the warden.

256
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,520
l got something important.
Come on, Smith!

257
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:38,359
- Hook me up!
- This is moving day.

258
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,137
l just want to be
sure you were aware of what's going on.

259
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,267
Last year during
rec time in the gymnasium,

260
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,473
you stabbed a man
named Louis Bevilaqua.

261
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,003
You killed him.
Do you remember that?

262
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,484
- Do you remember that?
- Bad, bad...

263
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,750
- Bald.
- Yeah.

264
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:07,521
So the court has found you guilty
of first-degree murder.

265
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,551
The judge...

266
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,292
he has sentenced
you to death.

267
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:19,294
- Death, dying, dead.
- Yes.

268
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:22,501
Peter-- Peter Marie?

269
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:27,604
And they are going
to transfer you to death row

270
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:30,206
where you are
going to stay...

271
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:33,548
until...
the day of your--

272
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,781
- No!
- Execution.

273
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:38,688
Save! Save! Save...

274
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,626
Sorry...

275
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:10,348
Hey, Lopresti, who's that?

276
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,654
lt's your new playmate,
William Giles.

277
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:16,792
Peter, Peter Marie.

278
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:19,457
She's not here
to protect you, pal.

279
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,899
From now on,
l'm your lifeline.

280
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:33,373
Hey, my name's Moses.
How you doing?

281
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,712
- Tutti-frutti.
- Tutti-frutti?

282
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,718
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Dit dit dit dit.

283
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:43,483
Dit dit dit.
Dit dit dit.

284
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,821
- Dah dah dah dah dah.
- Great.

285
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,657
My last days on earth and l'm locked up
with a fucking lunatic.

286
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,364
- Puppy dog.
- Right.

287
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:06,071
You got more than that.
Come on, push it!

288
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:09,137
Yeah.

289
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:11,710
Yeah.

290
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:16,111
That's it.
Yeah, Come on.

291
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,918
Keep it up.

292
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,025
You do not belong here.

293
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,627
- Minister Said, l--
- l told you 100 times,

294
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,296
you cannot become a Muslim.

295
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,234
Please, help me.

296
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,676
Let go of me!

297
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,564
Come on.

298
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:14,235
Prisoner number 00T255,
Leroy Tidd;

299
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,148
Convicted May 10th, 2000;
armed robbery, reckless endangerment.

300
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:25,322
Sentence: 20 years,
up for parole in 1 2.

301
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:33,288
- Whoa!
- Ball!

302
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,766
- Give me the ball.
- Tell your friend Said

303
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,326
- l don't like getting sent to the hole.
- Give me the ball.

304
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,235
Oh, sure.

305
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:43,801
l got you, nigger.

306
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,444
What happened
to your face?

307
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,107
Let me tell you.

308
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:26,311
l want to tell you.
Whatever anger

309
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,216
you feel towards
Leroy Tidd...

310
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,584
will disappear.

311
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:33,352
Okay.
l'm listening.

312
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,767
Thank you for getting me
out of the hole

313
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:48,967
and for arranging for me
to come back to Emerald City.

314
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,673
l was wrong.

315
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,339
l've been blaming you
for the sins of others.

316
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,349
For that
l am truly sorry.

317
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:13,061
Salam Alaikum, my brother.

318
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,709
l hate the fact that we all look like
saps while the niggers win.

319
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,440
Don't worry.
Once Said's dead,

320
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,040
- we'll flatten Tidd's black ass.
- Yeah.

321
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,051
Fucker doesn't know
how to pull a punch.

322
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:34,780
Told you guys
to leave Said alone.

323
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,788
What, do you wanna
start a fucking war?

324
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:39,950
Vern, Tidd's gonna do
all the dirty work.

325
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,619
No one will know
we're involved.

326
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,150
This is Oz.

327
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,663
People have a way
of finding out the truth.

328
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:49,155
Look, why don't you
go thump your Bible, okay?

329
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,237
Beat it. Scram.

330
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:02,277
We're buddies
with Vern Schillinger.

331
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,145
You been fucking
with his head.

332
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:07,482
Hoyt, we agreed l'd do the talking.
Let me do the fucking talking.

333
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,850
Then get
to the point.

334
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:13,520
First, you convince him to join that
interaction program with Beecher.

335
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,928
Gentlemen, l assure you,
l didn't convince him to do anything

336
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:21,626
except look in his heart,
open his heart to the Lord.

337
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,761
- His heart was beating fine.
- Hoyt, go read a book.

338
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:33,010
Schillinger runs
the Brotherhood.

339
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,639
l understand you look to him
for leadership.

340
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:39,242
No, we look to him
for balls, not heart.

341
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:40,774
Balls.

342
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,050
When something needs to get done,
it needs to get done

343
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:45,716
without no--
What'd you call it?

344
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,458
Moral dilemma.

345
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:52,759
- There are ways to get things done.
- Not here, Rev.

346
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,097
You back off on Vern,

347
00:25:56,134 --> 00:26:00,127
or Hoyt-- he'll see to it that you
and Jesus have a face-to-face soon...

348
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,197
in heaven.

349
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,765
Let's go.

350
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,209
l got a visit from a couple
of friends of yours,

351
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:09,908
- Robson, Hoyt.
- They threaten you?

352
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:12,508
- Yes.
- l'll talk to them.

353
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,075
Ah, don't.
l'm not afraid.

354
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,144
l'm just telling you
l thought you should know.

355
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:18,713
They would do anything
to get you back.

356
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:23,160
Look, Reverend,
l-- l've been reading the Scriptures,

357
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:27,529
talking to you, but l still don't know
where l am in all this.

358
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,761
l don't want to be
some big Holy Roller,

359
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:33,259
l just-- just want
to have some joy in my life.

360
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:36,468
Now if those two fuckers can't
appreciate that, then to hell with them.

361
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:39,477
Yeah, to hell
with them indeed.

362
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:44,579
Now here's the name and number
of a woman l want you to call

363
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,176
if you need anything
before the baby comes,

364
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:50,780
or if you just want
to talk things through.

365
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,484
The New Church of Christ.

366
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,789
Man, l heard of them.
Ain't that the group

367
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:59,319
whose minister got caught stealing
hundreds and thousands of dollars?

368
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:02,527
The Reverend Cloutier, yes.
He's here in Oz.

369
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,535
And he's a good man, Carrie.

370
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,335
l've told him all about you,
you know, how you got nobody,

371
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,364
- except for me and Hank.
- Hank?

372
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,242
Where the fuck is Hank?

373
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:14,575
Not even a postcard.

374
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:16,604
You gotta remember,
the boy left town

375
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,707
before he knew
you were pregnant.

376
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,116
lf Hank was aware of what
was going on, he'd be here.

377
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:24,179
Yeah, don't be so sure.

378
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:34,157
Reverend Cloutier says
that this woman, this Sarah,

379
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:37,293
she was all alone
and pregnant

380
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,270
before she found
his congregation.

381
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:44,037
When you get lonely, call her, okay?
She understands.

382
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:49,071
Mr. Schillinger, l didn't take you
for the religious type.

383
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:50,945
l'm-- l'm not.

384
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:55,352
l-- l mean,
l've always been Christian.

385
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:59,983
Just... l'm starting to see other parts
of the picture now.

386
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:10,532
Okay, Schillinger's on his way
to the interaction.

387
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:13,367
- Uh-huh.
- You nervous?

388
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:16,772
You and l have talked through
all my feelings about Schillinger.

389
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,571
l know exactly
what l want to say to him

390
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,078
and l pretty much know
know what he's gonna tell me,

391
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:23,707
yet my hands are sweaty
and l'm borderline nauseous.

392
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:26,377
All right, but that doesn't mean
that it's wrong to meet with him.

393
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,579
l just want my daughter
to be safe.

394
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,281
l want my family
to be safe.

395
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,948
And l'd like to wake up one morning
and not be afraid.

396
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:39,928
Come in, Vern.

397
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,365
Why don't we
all sit down?

398
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:56,238
Okay, so who wants
to go first?

399
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,078
l do.

400
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:02,485
With your permission, l'd like to start
with a reading from the Holy Scripture.

401
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:05,684
Ah, sure.

402
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:09,160
- Tobias, do you mind?
- Nope, not at all.

403
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,825
''The wolf shall dwell
with the lamb,

404
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,393
and the leopard shall
lie down with the kid

405
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:23,033
and the calf and the lion
and the fatling together,

406
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:26,841
and a little child
shall lead them.

407
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,642
The cow and the bear
shall feed.

408
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:32,673
Their young shall
lie down together,

409
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:35,584
and the lion shall
eat straw like the ox.

410
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,020
The sucking child shall play
over the hole of the asp

411
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:42,652
and the weaned child
shall put his hand on the adder's den.

412
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:47,654
They shall not hurt or destroy
in all my holy mountain.''

413
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:57,464
Prisoner number 96K423,
Timothy Kirk;

414
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:01,206
Convicted April 16th, 1996;

415
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:04,272
Manslaughter, endangering
the welfare of a child.

416
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,546
Sentence: 1 2 years,

417
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:09,452
up for parole in seven.

418
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,556
Mmm, healthy body,
healthy mind.

419
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,296
ln the Catholic Church, the body
is the temple of the Holy Spirit

420
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:23,495
that we're supposed to keep pure.
You believe that, Preacher?

421
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,299
The body is
God's gift to us.

422
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:28,465
We're obligated
to take care of it.

423
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:32,633
What about sex?
ls that a gift of God too?

424
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,304
Of course.

425
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,406
How'd you like
a blow job?

426
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,185
What makes you think
l want a blow job?

427
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,251
Everybody wants
a blow job.

428
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,525
No, thank you.
Step back, please.

429
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:04,098
You made a lifetime
out of being adorable,

430
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:07,669
sexy in a lost-little-
boy kind of way,

431
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:10,408
but you threw
your baby in the trash.

432
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:15,181
That's a man's crime.
lt's time for you to be a man.

433
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,233
Bob, did you have
a nice visit with your son?

434
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:40,301
Yes, though he says my grandson's health
is getting more precarious.

435
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,438
Oh, l'm sorry to hear that.

436
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,811
Norma.

437
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:49,551
- Bob Rebadow, my fiancee, Norma Clark.
- A pleasure.

438
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,647
Agamemnon's told me
so much about you.

439
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,090
Nothing good, l hope.

440
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,093
l'll leave you
two lovebirds alone.

441
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,791
Did you talk to whoever you needed
to talk to about us getting married?

442
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,631
l have an appointment
to see the warden tomorrow.

443
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,967
- You don't think there'll be a problem?
- Oh no.

444
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,597
Oh good.

445
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,177
We were already engaged
to be married, Maggie and l,

446
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:22,083
when we learned that
she was pregnant.

447
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:26,717
Today that's no big deal,

448
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:29,921
but back in '65,

449
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:33,528
given her family's
position in society,

450
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:36,125
''out of wedlock''
meant scandal.

451
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,830
Still, we could've
weathered the storm together.

452
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:42,806
Maggie was...

453
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,403
Oh, Maggie.

454
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,912
That's enough for tonight.

455
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:51,438
Two weeks before
the wedding,

456
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,542
l stabbed Norton Pratt
in the neck.

457
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:58,385
And Maggie,
she died in childbirth.

458
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,959
My beautiful Maggie.

459
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:09,825
l wish you all the happiness
in the world, Agamemnon.

460
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:11,096
Thank you, Bob.

461
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:17,764
l do want to dance
at your wedding!

462
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:21,977
Busmalis.

463
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:24,278
Busmalis.

464
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,951
l know your dirty
little secret.

465
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,477
l have a dirty
little secret?

466
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:33,616
A little secret
involving dirt.

467
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:37,992
You know, like digging.
You dig?

468
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,830
The night before they threw my ass
back up in here again,

469
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:45,301
l'll be goddamned,

470
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:48,306
l saw you digging
a motherfucking tunnel.

471
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,605
- Tunnel? No.
- Don't play me.

472
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:54,872
What the fuck do l
look like to you?

473
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,540
What do you want?

474
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:58,981
From you... nothing.

475
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,451
But l may use
what l know

476
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,579
to get my ass out
of solitary, all right?

477
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,145
No, please.

478
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,682
- l'm getting married, see--
- What? Married?

479
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,458
What the fuck do l care
if you get married?

480
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:15,989
- l'll pay you.
- Pay me? Pay me what?

481
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:18,366
What the hell
good is money

482
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:20,428
with my ass locked up in here
like this, huh?

483
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,838
Hey, no talking!

484
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:27,072
l'd allow someone to get married
inside the prison

485
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:30,377
- only as a reward for good behavior.
- l'm very well-behaved.

486
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,406
You dug a tunnel
and escaped

487
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,112
along with Alvarez, causing me great
embarrassment.

488
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,780
But you recaptured us both.

489
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,756
Busmalis is sorry for what
he did, aren't you?

490
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,452
Yes.

491
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,961
And we could use a little
romance around here, Leo.

492
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,055
Okay.

493
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:49,566
lf you swear to me that you won't dig
another tunnel,

494
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,398
l'll let you have
the ceremony.

495
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:53,495
But l find out
that you're lying,

496
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:56,564
it's solitary confinement
and you'll never see Norma again.

497
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:59,202
Warden, on my father's grave,
my mother's life

498
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:02,771
and my honor as a scout,
l swear l won't dig anymore.

499
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:07,181
Go ahead,
make the arrangements.

500
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:13,219
l've never actually
filled in a tunnel before.

501
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,393
Feels almost like murder.

502
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,857
Such a lovely tunnel too.

503
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:23,834
- You'd better get cracking.
- Yeah.

504
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,774
Busmalis,
l think you may--

505
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,650
Uh-oh.

506
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,712
- Shit!
- What's the matter?

507
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,155
l hit something.

508
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,025
Holy Jesus.

509
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,974
Hey, start digging,
Busmalis.

510
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,403
Last year the Hatfields
and the McCoys,

511
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:41,105
two families who've been feuding
for something like 150 years,

512
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:43,613
sat down together
and made peace.

513
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,381
lmagine that, giving up all that hate
after all those years.

514
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:53,083
Some people think the whole brouhaha
started over a stolen pig

515
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:56,025
though there are those
who swear the feud was over a woman.

516
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,126
Floria, this is
my favorite song.

517
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:06,466
Bullshit, Lopresti,
you don't even know who's singing.

518
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:09,496
- Yo, Floria, where you from?
- Jane Street Projects.

519
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,101
Say word.
Yo, me, too.

520
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:16,273
Well, you know, nearby.
l grew up on MLK in Southern.

521
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:18,248
l love your eyes.

522
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:21,582
l just fucking
love your eyes, girl.

523
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,610
- Morning, Floria.
- Hi.

524
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:28,849
- Long wait to see Leo?
- Yeah, and he isn't even in yet.

525
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:31,862
Hill, Poet,
what are you doing here?

526
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:34,421
Yo, everybody signed
this petition to get cable.

527
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:37,332
That's right, broadcast
television sucks.

528
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,132
Oh, yeah? Well, you should've
brought this to me.

529
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,399
Take them back.

530
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,999
- Bye, Floria.
- Bye.

531
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:46,602
- Later, Floria.
- Bye, beautiful eyes.

532
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,374
- Beautiful, pretty eyes.
- Would you get out?

533
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,816
Hey, McManus, when the warden comes
you can go ahead of me.

534
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:59,721
- Yeah. You're so generous, Lopresti.
- Well, you're a busy man.

535
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,452
Hello.
McManus, Lopresti.

536
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,289
Look, give me
a couple minutes, okay?

537
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:04,955
- Sure.
- Take your time.

538
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,554
Oh, Warden,
before you go in--

539
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,935
What the--

540
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,071
Surprise.

541
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,340
l had the workers
redecorate over the weekend.

542
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:25,748
Hey, Floria, maybe next
you can do my office.

543
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:27,910
- Looks okay?
- Okay?

544
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:31,251
lt's... fantastic.

545
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,816
You're fantastic.

546
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:40,125
The cafeteria's all set up
for the regional conference.

547
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,462
The other wardens
will be here by 10:00,

548
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,469
- and the governor arrives at 11 :30.
- Good.

549
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:47,368
And l got a lead
on an apartment for you

550
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:52,206
about six blocks from here, an
efficiency, all furnished, maid service.

551
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:55,940
- My wife call?
- No... sir.

552
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,380
Send her some flowers.

553
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,579
Warden, l do have a message.
lt's from her lawyer.

554
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,419
He wants to know who he should contact
regarding the divorce.

555
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:07,856
l don't know.
How the fuck should l know?

556
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:12,727
lt's my first divorce.

557
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,527
Well, l could
find you someone.

558
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:17,056
My brother's an attorney.
He'll know the right guy.

559
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,997
Send the flowers anyway.

560
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:41,519
Hello, Leo.
Conference is going great.

561
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,026
You really pulled it off.

562
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,961
l should've known
you'd show up, Querns.

563
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:46,793
Well, l am running Loyler now.

564
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:50,824
When l heard the commissioner was
considering you to replace Saul Cards,

565
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:53,029
l called him and told him
what l thought of you.

566
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:56,234
And you can see how much
influence you have.

567
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,972
Fuck off.

568
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:03,977
Wait. Don't you want
to know how Clayton Hughes is doing?

569
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:10,019
Not great. The prisoners all hate him
because he used to be a CO.

570
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:12,682
And the COs hate him because
they consider him a turncoat.

571
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,420
He's getting
in a lot of fights.

572
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,451
Right now l got him
in protective custody.

573
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:20,487
But the truth is, l don't think
he'll survive the year.

574
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:24,433
- Christ.
- Main attraction has arrived.

575
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:29,767
l want to transfer
Clayton to Oz.

576
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:31,775
- l can protect him.
- Right.

577
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:33,436
l can protect him.

578
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:35,673
Leo, Martin.

579
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:38,511
Governor, you seem to be getting around
pretty well on those things.

580
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:41,177
My physical therapist says
l'm recuperating faster

581
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,016
than any patient
she's ever had.

582
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:45,215
l expect to drop these crutches
in a matter of weeks.

583
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:48,925
Nice little shindig, Leo.

584
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,928
Lot of people thought
l shouldn't come,

585
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:53,590
given the fact that this
is the same room...

586
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,065
where l got shot.

587
00:40:57,602 --> 00:40:59,160
But l say,
what the fuck, huh?

588
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:01,137
Without your boy Clayton's
helping hand,

589
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:04,005
Alva Case might've won
the election.

590
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:06,532
Remind me to send
Hughes a thank-you card.

591
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:20,423
- My God.
- Hello, Leo. Good to be home.

592
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,886
- Which unit am l gonna be in?
- Unit J.

593
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:28,454
The cop unit?
No way.

594
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,429
Since when do you think
you have a choice? Let's go.

595
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:42,306
Who were your friends,
dickhead?

596
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:44,814
Who are your friends,
you little cocksucker?

597
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:51,216
Son of a bitch.
You little cock!

598
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:53,689
l'm gonna knock
the shit out of you!

599
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:56,454
You cocksucker,
shithead, bastard!

600
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:58,359
Son of a bitch!

601
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:01,388
You spit on me!
You little prick!

602
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:03,059
You fucking bastard!

603
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:09,268
Prisoner number 01Y208,
Alvin Hewitt;

604
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:12,572
Convicted January 20th, 2001 ;

605
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,669
aggravated assault
of a minor.

606
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:17,010
Sentence: 1 2 years,

607
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,812
up for parole in seven.

608
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:22,376
Hey, when's lunch get here?
l'm starving.

609
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,322
Lunch'll get here the same time it gets
here every other fucking day.

610
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:29,190
Hey you know, Howell,
we had a female deputy sheriff

611
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:31,491
- back home that was a lot like you.
- Oh yeah?

612
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,520
Yeah, yeah, she was tough,
no bullshit.

613
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:35,327
Hey, had opinions about
everything.

614
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,231
And l suppose you
and your men

615
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:40,135
in that little dink farm town
you're from couldn't handle that?

616
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:41,900
Oh no, we didn't have to.

617
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:43,964
She got drunk
one night after work,

618
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,771
went to a little bar
in Spencer,

619
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:49,211
got gang-banged on the pool-table
by a bunch of bikers.

620
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:52,080
Speaking of which,
why ain't we got a pool-table?

621
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:53,811
- Officer Howell?
- Yes, sir.

622
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:59,723
- You know Clayton Hughes.
- Of course. Cell two.

623
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:04,956
Officer, l want you to make sure
that no harm comes to him.

624
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:07,590
l'm a CO, Warden,
not a miracle worker.

625
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:15,733
How you doing, John?

626
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,575
Couldn't be better.

627
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,809
Lunch.

628
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:41,558
l made this especially
for you, Detective.

629
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,630
Put a little extra
seasoning on it.

630
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:47,069
- You spit it in?
- l pissed in it.

631
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:54,976
New guy, is he the CO who tried
to assassinate Governor Devlin?

632
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:59,314
- Yeah.
- Guess he should've spent

633
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:02,183
a little more time
on the shooting range.

634
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:04,244
- What'd you say, motherfucker, huh?
- Hey!

635
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:07,189
Jesus Christ!

636
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,760
For Christ sake, wait!
Please, man! Please.

637
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:15,789
You know Goergen wasn't
well-liked, John,

638
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:20,497
but that doesn't excuse you from pushing
him down an elevator shaft.

639
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:23,735
But l think most people
in the department believe

640
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:25,139
that you did what
you had to do.

641
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:27,508
Not Nancy.

642
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:31,379
She didn't come to my trial.
She hasn't been here once.

643
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:33,940
l'm not gonna
lie to you, John.

644
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:37,284
Nancy's angry.
You were her partner.

645
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,551
She feels that
you betrayed her trust.

646
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:43,626
The worst part
about being in this place

647
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:46,323
is you can't talk to the people you need
to set things straight.

648
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:49,822
Look, l'll tell you
the other reason l'm here.

649
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:52,062
Your wife called.

650
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:55,561
She's very upset that
you refuse to see her or Robby.

651
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:57,096
l can't.

652
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,507
Doesn't Abby understand?
l can't face her...

653
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:04,381
or him... my son.

654
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:08,112
- She wants a visit without Robby.
- No.

655
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:09,551
- John.
- No.

656
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:13,853
Look, she loves you, and your silence
is killing her

657
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,452
in the same way that Nancy's
silence is hurting you.

658
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,871
lt was an honor
serving under you, sir.

659
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:05,505
Holy fucking shit, Keller.

660
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,773
- Hey, man, Good to see you.
- Oh, man. How are you?

661
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:09,575
- How you doing?
- Ronnie's cute.

662
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:11,638
Does he like
to fool around?

663
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:32,160
Count!

664
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:40,432
97B41 2, Beecher;

665
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:44,278
00M87 1, Morales;

666
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,148
96G522, Morales;

667
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:50,176
95H522, Hill.

668
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,059
- Ronnie boy.
- What's up?

669
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:59,026
What are you doing,
jerking off there?

670
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:03,090
Just giving old Magic Johnson
his morning stretch, that's all.

671
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:06,331
Yeah, as long as old Magic didn't get
any action last night.

672
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,167
Meaning?

673
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:10,901
Well, they got rules
against us fucking.

674
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:13,967
Yeah, right. Since when do you follow
the fucking rules, man?

675
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,445
Since you got stuck
with Beecher.

676
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,311
You don't want to be sticking
your prick into that prick.

677
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,546
- No?
- No, the guy's a slut.

678
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:23,678
Nothing but trouble.

679
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:25,086
Wow.

680
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:27,716
Boy, wish you would've told me
that yesterday...

681
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,358
because last night
he gave me a blow job deluxe.

682
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,598
l know what you're doing.

683
00:47:44,642 --> 00:47:47,634
Fucking Barlog
to make me jealous?

684
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,848
You're a miserable little cunt,
you know that?

685
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:55,340
You killed the last two guys
l slept with.

686
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:57,377
You gonna kill your old friend,
Ronnie, too?

687
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:12,263
So let me try to understand
something here.

688
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:14,794
l mean you-- you were
the king of the scams, man.

689
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:16,738
You could hustle a cop
out of his badge.

690
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:21,677
How the hell did you get busted
for robbing a grocery store,

691
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,646
reckless fucking driving?

692
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,741
Yeah, well, after
my last divorce

693
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:30,185
- l went into kind of a tailspin.
- l remember.

694
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:34,317
Lots of drugs,
lots of college boys.

695
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,452
You know, a part of me
thinks in retrospect

696
00:48:37,494 --> 00:48:41,225
l robbed that store-- which was
the stupidest thing l could've done...

697
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:44,995
'cause l wanted
to get caught.

698
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,631
You know, some demented
slice of my brain was saying,

699
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:51,368
''Hey, take some time
off the street.''

700
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:53,808
88 years, that's a...

701
00:48:55,145 --> 00:48:56,840
that's a long time
off the street.

702
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:05,354
What, Keller?

703
00:49:13,264 --> 00:49:14,663
Hello!

704
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,463
Get a room.

705
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:34,317
Lights out.

706
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:38,954
Finally.

707
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:50,432
- Ronnie.
- No, no, no.

708
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,134
- What? What's the matter?
- Keller.

709
00:49:57,174 --> 00:49:59,267
What about him?

710
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:07,047
- He and l fucked this afternoon.
- What?

711
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:09,382
Yeah. First time.

712
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:11,979
And it was great.

713
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,990
l mean, l-- l knew him,
you know.

714
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:15,958
He and l, we ran together
all those years.

715
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:18,291
Keller was like
a big brother to me.

716
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:20,456
Sometimes he'd come up
with some Ponzi,

717
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:23,193
you know, and--
and l would just go along.

718
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:25,201
But, uh...

719
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,098
l guess l never
admitted to myself--

720
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,168
He says he loves me.

721
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:38,077
And he made me promise
that you and l wouldn't do it, so...

722
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:41,107
He doesn't love you, Ronnie.

723
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:43,415
lt's just another Ponzi.

724
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:46,753
Probably.
But, Beecher...

725
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,951
we're in Oz...

726
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,461
so what the fuck
is the difference?

727
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:10,070
So you were Keller's friend
before he got arrested?

728
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:12,173
Yeah, l knew him.
Sure, yeah.

729
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:15,083
On May 2nd, 1998,
Keller was at a gay bar

730
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,179
where he picked up
one Bryce Tibbetts.

731
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:21,316
He drove Tibbetts
across the state line to a forest

732
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,156
where he sodomized, tortured
and murdered the young man.

733
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:25,821
What's that
got to do with me?

734
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,127
Did Keller ever mention
killing Bryce Tibbetts?

735
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:29,928
Nah.

736
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:32,731
- How about Mark Carachi?
- No.

737
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,330
- Biam Lewis?
- Nope, none of that.

738
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:38,466
Too bad. See, if he had mentioned
these murders to you

739
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:42,206
and you'd been willing to testify, you
could've gotten your sentence reduced

740
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:44,146
from 1 3 years to, say, five.

741
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:49,108
Five?

742
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:53,385
The deal is out there
waiting to be reached.

743
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:02,062
- l gotta call my lawyer.
- You do that, Ronnie.

744
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,862
You make that call.

745
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:06,426
What is the only position
not mentioned

746
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,201
in the Abbott and Costello
routine ''Who's On First?''

747
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,834
- l hate baseball.
- l hate Abbott and Costello.

748
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:14,810
Well, it's not
in the infield.

749
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:16,608
- l need some help here.
- Didi.

750
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:18,638
Listen, l'm gonna say,
if l were you,

751
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:21,378
l wouldn't choose
the wrong position.

752
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:25,821
- Shortstop.
- Don't choose the wrong position?

753
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:28,484
- Right field.
- Right field.

754
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:32,017
You're in the right field
with $1,000.

755
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:35,657
Shit, we gotta
get cable, man.

756
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:41,798
We're thrilled when
this beauty school dropout

757
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,899
- decides to drop in--
- What do you want?

758
00:52:44,942 --> 00:52:47,968
You're-- you're
a lawyer, right?

759
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:50,536
- l was.
- Yeah.

760
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:54,278
Let me-- let me run a little something
by you, if you don't mind.

761
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,343
A deal that the--

762
00:52:56,386 --> 00:52:58,786
that the feds
are offering me.

763
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,847
l don't work pro bono.

764
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,223
l'll, uh--

765
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:08,296
l'll make the consultation
worth your while.

766
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:15,797
Maybe we can
work something out.

767
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:34,279
Keller.

768
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:39,626
Oh, are we speaking? l thought we were
trying to fuck with each other.

769
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:43,097
Ronnie Barlog is
about to sell you out.

770
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,543
You're a goddamn liar.

771
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:56,137
The FBl offered him
reduced prison time

772
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:59,080
if he testifies against you
in those homosexual murders.

773
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:04,585
You're saying that
'cause you're jealous.

774
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:13,086
Believe what
you want to believe.

775
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:17,460
Write me from death row.

776
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:27,741
Hey, who was it that
wanted to talk to you?

777
00:54:27,778 --> 00:54:31,043
FBl.

778
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,949
They were grilling me
about that bank job in Buffalo.

779
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:39,546
There we go with that.

780
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:43,950
You are amazing, Ronnie.
You fix anything, can't you?

781
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:47,828
Some people are just
mechanically inclined, that's all.

782
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,491
You got many gifts, Ronnie.

783
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:53,393
Got a great imagination,

784
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:55,302
got a way with words.

785
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:57,830
Me? Nah, come on.

786
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:00,502
l hear you been telling
a lot of fantastic stories.

787
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:04,779
- Huh?
- Stories about me

788
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:08,182
and my encounter
with certain young men.

789
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,686
Chris, l didn't say
nothing about that, l swear.

790
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:14,213
- You sure?
- Yeah, on my life, man. Come on.

791
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:22,327
You swear on your life,
that's enough for me.

792
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:29,872
Suck my dick.

793
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:33,868
Chris, you know l would
never jabber on you, man.

794
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,846
They did make me an offer, but l turned
those fed fucks down right there.

795
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:41,078
l told them, you know, ''You can kiss
my ass. lt ain't happening.''

796
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,978
You know,
sometimes l think

797
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:11,913
l killed all those guys

798
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:16,510
'cause l wanted to kill
the part of me l despise.

799
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:36,198
When you take revenge
on somebody,

800
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,731
you are actually paying them the highest
compliment possible.

801
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:43,212
lt's like saying,
''You affected my life

802
00:56:43,246 --> 00:56:45,908
to such an extent
that l must reciprocate.

803
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:50,784
l must affect your life as deeply
as you have mine.''

804
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:54,313
Revenge may be
the ultimate Hallmark card.

805
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:57,053
Yeah. When you think
of it like that,

806
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:01,724
the cliche is true:
Revenge is sweet.
