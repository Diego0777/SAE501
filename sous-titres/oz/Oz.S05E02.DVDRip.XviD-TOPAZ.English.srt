1
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,097
There are three kinds of laws
which govern us all.

2
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,363
First and foremost
are the laws of God,

3
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,734
followed closely by the
laws of nature

4
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,070
and, running a distant third,
the laws created by man.

5
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,042
You see, in order
for man to create a law,

6
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,340
a group of people have
to get together and decide

7
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,938
that they have come up
with the ultimate truth,

8
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,745
a basic inherent truth
by which every citizen

9
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,150
must conduct
himself or be punished.

10
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,747
The only problem is the group of people
who decides on the ultimate truth

11
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,122
is a bunch of politicians.

12
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,560
Given the choice, would you rather
be judged by a whim of the Almighty,

13
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,621
or a vote by Congress

14
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,066
Here comes the dead man.

15
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,698
Make you move, bro'.

16
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,269
Later, but I'm keeping
an eye on you.

17
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,303
Truer words have
never been spoke, man.

18
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,339
What the hell
does that mean?

19
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,351
Being only that you got
one good eye,

20
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,216
you droopy-eyed
motherfucker.

21
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,155
- You cocksucker!
- Get him! Kill him!

22
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,090
Kill that
motherfucker!

23
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,526
Kill that fucking brown-ass
motherfucker! Kill him!

24
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,077
Fascinating,
you in the cafeteria.

25
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,306
What do you mean?

26
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,442
Throwing caution
to the wind.

27
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,680
Think it'll work?

28
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,588
- Will I survive?
- I don't know.

29
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,524
But you gotta know.

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,290
You been in Oz,
like, 36 years.

31
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,457
Been through the same shit
that I've been through, and more.

32
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,593
And I know
you know all the tricks.

33
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,967
No, no tricks.

34
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,199
Well, then what?

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,606
I've just been myself.

36
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,578
Like I said, it's fascinating
the difference in generations.

37
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,174
You young people have grown up
with so much choice and possibility.

38
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,913
On the one hand,
that's a marvelous thing. On the other,

39
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,649
so many of you
battle with who you are.

40
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,089
For us, it was simpler.

41
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,787
There was none of this
finding yourself jazz.

42
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,262
You just concentrated
on what you had to do.

43
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:55,028
You were 18, 19 years old
going off to war.

44
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,366
So that's who you were.

45
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,634
That's who we all were.

46
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,937
So you guys are heroes?

47
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,410
That's what
you're telling me?

48
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,208
You guys are he-men?

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,478
Lord, no.
We were scared to death.

50
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,882
But when the landing boats
carried you to shore

51
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,750
and the metal doors
came down

52
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,051
you charged the beach,
took the blow.

53
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,287
That's just how it was.
It had to be done.

54
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,724
I've faced many hurdles

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,994
and moments of great fear
in my life.

56
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,366
But coming from an age
when men took the blow,

57
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,770
I've always felt comfortable
in my own skin.

58
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,708
Sounds good.
That's good.

59
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,910
Oh, Raider baby. Whoo.

60
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,144
Mmm!

61
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,620
Man, this baby...
Oh, shit.

62
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,624
Oh, hootchie mama.
Mmm.

63
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,431
I want you to stab me.

64
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,804
What?

65
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,173
I want you to shank me.

66
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,678
I won't retaliate.

67
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,113
Yeah? Are you going
to let me kill you?

68
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,118
Not kill.
Stab in the shoulder.

69
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,517
The proposition's this:

70
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,023
I'll give you
a free shot at me,

71
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,424
and in return,
I don't die.

72
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,792
What the fuck are
you talking about?

73
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,354
I'm willing
to take the blow.

74
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,856
Wouldn't it be satisfying
just to stick me?

75
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,269
Lt'd be immensely fucking
satisfying.

76
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,741
Okay. Make sure you hold up
your part of the bargain.

77
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,240
I want witnesses.

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,305
I want a lot of them.

79
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,147
I get this.

80
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,676
You let me
take a swipe at you

81
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,952
and the hacks throw me
in solitary for the next 10 years.

82
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,582
No.

83
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,889
We do it when the guards
aren't around.

84
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,759
You'll control that.

85
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,566
I just want
the inmates to see

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,433
so in case you do
decide to kill me,

87
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,634
one of the inmates
will go to Glynn,

88
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,199
give you up,

89
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,211
you end up on death row.

90
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,478
Deal.

91
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,985
What that loco motherfucker
don't know

92
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,549
is that I am gonna
kill him.

93
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,461
After he's down, I slip
a shank in his hand

94
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,488
and it's self-defense.

95
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,228
Fuck.

96
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,963
What's the matter?

97
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,528
My sister's dead,

98
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,269
and ever since I heard the news
I've felt nothing.

99
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,767
And now you tell me
you're going to kill Alvarez

100
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,874
and I feel
this little charge in my belly.

101
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,243
Jesus, what the hell
is that?

102
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,187
It's nothing.

103
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,417
My little sister
worshipped me.

104
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,095
You can't kill Alvarez.

105
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,223
- What?!
- I haven't shed a tear for a sister

106
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,325
who thought
that much of me.

107
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,394
And at the same time,
this Alvarez thing is revving me up.

108
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,999
It's not right.
There's something wrong.

109
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,602
And out of respect for Annette,
I gotta take a look at that.

110
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,476
We both do.

111
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,038
What's happening is you're
on a delayed reaction.

112
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,549
You're in shock.

113
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,246
In a week, you'll be crying
like a baby over your sister.

114
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,187
Thing is,
we don't got a week.

115
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,214
Our best chance to kill
Alvarez is here, right now.

116
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,589
Chico.

117
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,134
You ready?

118
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,135
Ready.

119
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,976
Yo! Yo, my man!
Look over here!

120
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,505
Over here!
Guys, over here! Watch this!

121
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,348
Right.
Right here.

122
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,718
Central, this is 14.
We got a 29 in the gym.

123
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,688
Repeat, we got a 29
in the gym. Get down here.

124
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,318
Hey, hang on, hang on.
Repeat, I have a 29 in the gym.

125
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,294
This is 14.

126
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,661
There you are.
You look right smart.

127
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,728
I wish they'd let you
come with me to the funeral.

128
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,139
Me too, but I wasn't
really a relative or nothing.

129
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,542
I still can't
believe this, man.

130
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,706
How can my moms be dead?

131
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,046
I remember
when I first met your mother.

132
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,416
We were none of us
no more than 14.

133
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,115
I was with your dad,

134
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,851
doing some kind
of nonsense

135
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,724
when all of a sudden,

136
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,730
I saw her coming across
Friedmont Street.

137
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,996
Mmm! She had the
sweetest pair of eyes.

138
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,261
Your dad didn't
even notice her

139
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,139
until I tapped him
on his shoulder.

140
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,973
He looked at her,
she looked at him and that was that.

141
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,412
They got married,
they had you.

142
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,313
Burr...

143
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,683
you always loved
my moms, didn't you?

144
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,779
Of course.

145
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,689
No. No.

146
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,921
No, I mean
you loved her.

147
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,566
I loved your father too.

148
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,434
But life works out
the way life works out.

149
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,304
I want you to put that
on her grave for me.

150
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,477
- What is this?
- My high school graduation ring.

151
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,316
Yo, Busmalis, any word from your fiancée
since she left you at the altar?

152
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,952
Ha. Yeah, sure.

153
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,691
Like, "Don't try and track me down.
I done skipped town."

154
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,666
No, I watched this show yesterday.
Norma's still working

155
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,100
on "Miss Sally."
Her name's still in the credits.

156
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,663
Those are repeats.
In fact, I read in the newspaper

157
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,197
they may even cancel
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard."

158
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,709
What?

159
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,508
Jeez, you are a sad fuck.
No wonder she ditched you.

160
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,343
What the hell
do you know about it?

161
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,714
Know about what,
motherfucker, what?

162
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:56,745
Loss, being left. You have
no damn idea, you stupid fool.

163
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,223
Ooh!

164
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,063
Hey, I appreciate
your sticking up for me,

165
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,300
but you're gonna
get your butt whooped.

166
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,366
Okay, whatever you say.

167
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,902
- What's eating you?
- My son came to see me today.

168
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,541
Alex Jr.'s condition
has gotten worse.

169
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,074
He's developed
nonlymphocytic leukemia.

170
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,679
Oh, Bob.

171
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,155
That's terrible.

172
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,557
He's in desperate need
of a bone marrow transplant.

173
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,994
- They need you to be the donor?
- No, I'm no good to him.

174
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,364
Nobody in our family is.
Alex Jr.'s mother is

175
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,835
of West Indian
and Guatemalan descent.

176
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,998
My grandson's unique
mixed-race heritage

177
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,008
makes...

178
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,205
for the most beautiful skin
you'll ever lay eyes on.

179
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,705
It also makes finding
a suitable donor extremely difficult.

180
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,413
- There's gotta be a match somewhere.
- Oh, sure, somewhere.

181
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,719
But there's
a great shortage of donors,

182
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,521
and an even greater shortage
of minority donors.

183
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,586
Then doctors should get the word out,
sign more people up.

184
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,995
I wish it were that easy.

185
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,830
But like with so many
other diseases,

186
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,735
there's never enough
money to go around.

187
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,705
Where you going?

188
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,904
To see Dr. Nathan.
I don't feel so hot.

189
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,948
The umbilical cord,
like bone marrow,

190
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,953
contains cells capable
of fighting leukemia.

191
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,889
Unfortunately, that procedure's still very
much in the experimental stages.

192
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,324
Oh, thanks.
Here you go.

193
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,225
Take these.
You'll be fine.

194
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,525
I know how helpless
you feel, Bob.

195
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,230
I hear a story like your grandson's
and it frustrates me too.

196
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,501
My Latina heritage kicks in

197
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,100
and starts kicking me
for being so American.

198
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,203
- I don't follow.
- In Central America,

199
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,511
South America, there's wide belief
that certain herbal medicines

200
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,417
hold great promise in regards
to treating cancer and other diseases.

201
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,819
But you think that's
a bunch of baloney?

202
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,424
Like I said, the AMA
got the best of me.

203
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,594
Pamphlets, magazines,
medical journals,

204
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,568
anything to do
with herbal medicine,

205
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,163
particularly material dealing
with research and treatment of leukemia.

206
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,234
Lights out!

207
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,731
I've found
the cure for cancer.

208
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,433
- You what?
- Lapacho.

209
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,342
- Lapa-who?
- An herb,

210
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,608
from the rainforests
of Paraguay.

211
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,980
Some doctors claim they've
effectively used the herb

212
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,145
to treat cancer,
leukemia in particular.

213
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,146
- Wow. This is great news.
- No, no, no, it's not.

214
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,421
- It's maddening.
- Maddening?

215
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,088
Lapacho is an evergreen.

216
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,792
There are more than 100 species
of lapacho trees.

217
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,996
Identifying which ones
yield the necessary

218
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,802
medicinal material
is very expensive.

219
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,934
Oh, here we go again.
Always money, money, money.

220
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,103
The only way for a man
to get ahead in the world

221
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,136
is to be some kind
of goddamn millionaire.

222
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,479
- I'll raise the cash!
- In Oz? How?

223
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,613
I don't know,
but I'll find a way.

224
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,415
Good luck.

225
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,924
Here are some laws,
real laws currently on the books.

226
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,396
Laws that if you broke,
you'd end up in jail.

227
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,899
The state of Rhode Island

228
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,131
says it's illegal to throw
pickle juice on a trolley.

229
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,662
In the state of Washington,
all lollipops are banned.

230
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,641
Down in Indiana,

231
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,874
baths may not be taken between
the months of October and March.

232
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,781
Over in San Francisco, you cannot
pick up and throw used confetti.

233
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,117
And in North Carolina,
the law forbids dogs and cats to fight.

234
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,215
But you see, that goes
against the laws of nature.

235
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,692
Dogs and cats
are born enemies.

236
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,661
Okay, all done.
Wheel him into the ward.

237
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,494
- We've got trauma to the head.
- What happened?

238
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,330
I was releasing this joker from the hole
and he took a swing at me.

239
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,598
- I ain't no pussy.
- Yeah. So I gave him one of these.

240
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,265
- Faggot!
- Prep him. It doesn't look too bad.

241
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,740
You'll need a couple of stitches.
What's your name?

242
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,074
Stanton, Henry Stanton.
And I don't love you.

243
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,205
- What?
- Glynn sent me to the hole

244
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,738
'cause he said I was obsessed
with your tits, but I'm not.

245
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,183
You gotta tell the warden
I'm an innocent man.

246
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,084
- Okay.
- You gotta... get the fuck...

247
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,090
- tell the warden I'm an innocent man!
- Get off me!

248
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,888
- Hey, hey, hey, Stanton!
- Oh, Jeez! Ow!

249
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,054
- You all right?
- I was handling this, Ryan.

250
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,395
- It didn't look like it.
- Well, l... I don't need you in my life.

251
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,093
- Okay.
- Just get the fuck away from me!

252
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,965
- Okay!
- Keep moving, O'Reily!

253
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,494
I need those sutures!
Where the fuck are they?

254
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,200
I need another pair
of gloves, and prep him for sutures.

255
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,004
Can you hold him,
please?

256
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,937
There you go, Enrique.

257
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,744
Yo, Ryan, save
some extra beets.

258
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,377
All of a sudden you got
quite an appetite there, Marty.

259
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,047
Oh, yeah, I never seem
to get enough.

260
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,181
- Which is why we gotta talk.
- About what?

261
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,954
- My compensation for lying to Glynn.
- Shut the fuck up.

262
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:11,156
That's what I'm talking about.
For me to keep my lips zipped,

263
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,688
- you gotta come up with more moolah.
- Come on, Marty, man.

264
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,293
- We had a deal, right?
- Well, I'm renegotiating.

265
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,531
All right.
I'll tell you what,

266
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,904
what do you say we meet
in the library, 4:00?

267
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,000
Bring your checkbook.

268
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,419
I had Montgomery lie
to the warden and say

269
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,512
that Henry Stanton
killed Patrick Keenan.

270
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,183
And Montgomery says if I don't
pay more he's gonna rat me out.

271
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,159
If he does, Glynn will know
for sure that you killed Keenan.

272
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,128
He'll fry your ass.

273
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:48,429
Which is why I'm not gonna make
my 4:00 appointment with Montgomery.

274
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,094
No?

275
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,298
No, I'll have Stanton
show up instead.

276
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,909
Yo, Stanton.

277
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,179
O'Reily, I ain't
bothering your brother

278
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,813
or Nathan or nobody.
So just leave me alone.

279
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,880
Look, I know that, man.
I think you and me,

280
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,915
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

281
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,519
But I just want to let you know
that I got no beef with you.

282
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,656
- That's good.
- In fact, actually, you and me,

283
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,165
we got something
in common.

284
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,395
We're both suspects in
the murder of Patrick Keenan.

285
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,562
I know.

286
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,630
You know, we both got eyewitnesses
who say they saw us do the deed.

287
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,608
And I don't know
who's accusing me,

288
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,805
but as luck would have it,
I found out who's lying about you.

289
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,337
- Who?
- I'm hesitant to tell you there, Henry,

290
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,372
for fear you're gonna
do something crazy.

291
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,386
Motherfucker lies about me,
that does make me crazy.

292
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,548
- See then, I'm not gonna tell you.
- Tell me, God damn it.

293
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,717
- No, I don't think I should.
- Tell me!

294
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,453
- Please tell me.
- I'm not going to tell you.

295
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,325
- Tell me!
- I'm not going to fucking tell you!

296
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,193
- Tell me!
- I'm not going to fucking tell you!

297
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,667
- God damn it, please, tell me.
- Martin Montgomery.

298
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,999
Martin Montgomery?

299
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,601
I'm gonna kill
that fucking cunt!

300
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,841
I guess you won't be talking no more,
will you, motherfucker?

301
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,549
- Get off him!
- Oh, shit!

302
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,357
I got him.
We got a neck wound!

303
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,123
I got this guy...
Stanton!

304
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,995
Stanton's in solitary.

305
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,058
Montgomery's at Benchley Memorial
in critical condition.

306
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,605
People at the gym
say they overheard

307
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,203
you telling Stanton that Montgomery
squealed on him.

308
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,646
Oh, no. Stanton asked me if I'd...
if I knew anything about it,

309
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,617
and I told him I just heard
a rumor. That's all.

310
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,979
We found this
in Montgomery's foot locker.

311
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,322
What's that?

312
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,156
Keenan's shamrock.

313
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,220
Oh, yeah, right.
I recognize that now.

314
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,788
What the fuck was
Montgomery doing with it?

315
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,925
I was hoping maybe
you could tell me.

316
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,266
Oh no. Jeez, warden,
I don't know.

317
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,073
Suzanne Fitzgerald, the '60s radical
who turned herself in

318
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,339
to federal authorities after 32 years
on the run, was released today

319
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,437
from the Parker Correctional
Facility for Women.

320
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,970
No fucking way.

321
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,677
Governor James Devlin
has commuted Fitzgerald's sentence

322
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,618
- to two years of community service.
- Yes!

323
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,144
The governor's decision,
while widely expected,

324
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:28,091
- remains controversial.
- Yes! Come on, Cyril.

325
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,789
We're so glad you decided
to do your community service in Oz.

326
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,697
And the idea of starting
a performing arts program is great.

327
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:39,796
Oh, thank you. L... I taught music
for 20 years in St. Albans.

328
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,899
And when I heard that you didn't have
any kind of arts education program here,

329
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,910
it seemed like a good fit.

330
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,277
But you know the hardest part is gonna
be convincing these guys to sign up.

331
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,340
I don't know about that. I think
they'll sign up out of the novelty.

332
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,046
But the tough thing will be
getting them to stick with it.

333
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,784
Well, if I could motivate 10-year-olds,
I think I can handle your prisoners.

334
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,486
So what do you need
to get started?

335
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,017
Well, l... I would love to see
where I'm going to work.

336
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,724
The stage is in the cafeteria.
I'll take you right over.

337
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,223
- And then I'd like to see my son.
- Oh, sure.

338
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,309
Psst.

339
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,902
Ryan!

340
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,937
- Hey.
- Ryan.

341
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,212
Oh, Christ, I thought
I'd lost you forever.

342
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,310
Oh, no, baby.
You're stuck with me.

343
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,380
I know he's not your son,
and he's only my half-brother,

344
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,484
but I kind of want
you to meet Cyril.

345
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,088
- Oh, yeah, I'd love to.
- Yeah? Okay? Hey, Cyril? Cyril?

346
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,431
- Hello.
- Hello.

347
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,198
- I made this for you.
- Oh. Thank you.

348
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,536
That's so sweet.

349
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,106
It's beautiful.
Can I give you a hug and kiss?

350
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,136
- Sure.
- Okay.

351
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,322
So, are you two going
to be my first pupils?

352
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,654
Oh, jeez, you know, Mom,
l... I can't sing.

353
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,250
- Me neither.
- You can't?

354
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,558
Oh. Guess you take
after your father.

355
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,088
That man had the voice
of a warthog.

356
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,328
- She's funny, right?
- She's funny.

357
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,030
I'm glad you
think so.

358
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,369
Will you have some
of your friends sign up?

359
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,806
- Our friends?
- Uh-Huh.

360
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,742
Oh, yeah.
Of course.

361
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,574
All right, all right,
I'll do it.

362
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,046
In fact, I've been told I have
a pretty good voice.

363
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,481
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,178
In high school, I had the lead
in "The Pirates of Penzance."

365
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,414
? I am the very model
of a modern major general?

366
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,356
- ? I have information...?
- As far as my mother's concerned,

367
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,291
you've never sang a note,
you got it?

368
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,953
- Okay, not a problem.
- Okay.

369
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,356
Hey, O'Reily,
your mama's looking fine.

370
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,231
Does she
fuck younger guys?

371
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,327
What was that, Hoyt?
What the fuck you say?

372
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,340
- Fuck you, bitch!
- I'm gonna kill you!

373
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,343
- Shut the fuck up!
- Get the fuck away, you cocksucker!

374
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,607
- Bring it, Hoyt! Bring it!
- Get the fuck off!

375
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,446
Slowly, slowly roll up.
Roll up.

376
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,611
Wait. Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Wait... wait, Matt.

377
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,813
Hold on.
Okay.

378
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,722
Relax your jaw.
Relax your shoulders.

379
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,330
Relax your arms.

380
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,578
- We gotta talk.
- I'm in the middle of a class.

381
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,410
Oh, that's okay.
I've got work to do.

382
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,245
Well, l... I'll
see you Thursday?

383
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,183
Um...

384
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,742
definitely.

385
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,019
- Come here, come here, come here.
- What?

386
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,648
- I want you to quit.
- Quit?

387
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,420
- Yeah, look...
- On my first day?

388
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,521
I've ticked off a lot of the assholes
in this place, okay?

389
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,294
- I don't want to put you in jeopardy.
- Jeopardy?

390
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,359
- Yeah.
- There's a C.O. Standing nearby.

391
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,736
- Trust me, the hacks aren't reliable.
- I'm not worried.

392
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,298
- Yeah, but I am.
- Well, that's sweet.

393
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,175
Look, I'm not
being sweet, okay?

394
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,271
Christ, you could get hurt.

395
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,408
Ryan, I'm a big girl
and I've made my choice.

396
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,319
Look, this is where I'm needed.
This is where I belong.

397
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:20,415
Nothing you can say
is gonna make me change my mind.

398
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,360
Hey, O'Reily,
you working today?

399
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,228
- Go.
- Yeah, but, Mom...

400
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,165
- Go.
- Yo, move your fucking ass, O'Reily.

401
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,362
We working alone
on this, motherfucker?

402
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,449
Shit!

403
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,423
Dave, you're back.

404
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,264
- Yeah.
- How are you?

405
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,896
All right.

406
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,839
Look, I meant to get over
to the hospital, but...

407
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,139
That's okay.

408
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:16,910
How are you?
Oh, I already asked that, didn't I?

409
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,610
But you're...
you're good though, huh?

410
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,779
I'm working.

411
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,948
So you're staying at Oz?

412
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,254
I'm not sure.

413
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,920
Warden's got me
stationed here,

414
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,930
and I'm going to have
to think about my next move.

415
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,330
I feel fucking terrible
that this happened.

416
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,858
So, you never did find out
who cut me, did you?

417
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,097
No.

418
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:44,433
Truthfully... I think
that's why I'm here.

419
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:49,038
I want to know.
I fucking want to know.

420
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:54,446
I'd fucking hurt the guy, Tim,
I'm serious. I'd hurt him for keeps.

421
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,321
Your injury was
the result

422
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,553
of someone not wanting you to play
in that final basketball game.

423
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:06,257
- But how?
- Well, after we decided not to play...

424
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,499
I told Morales that you
were going to play.

425
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,760
Oh.

426
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,399
I'm so goddamned sorry.

427
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,869
I'll buzz you in.

428
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,997
Goddamn
motherfucking thing!

429
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,156
Tim, the warden
wanted me to tell you,

430
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,022
special staff meeting
at 11:00.

431
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,687
- Is there an emergency?
- Governor Devlin's coming.

432
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,993
- Got some kind of announcement.
- Can't wait.

433
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,296
- 11:00 on the dot. Don't be late!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

434
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,201
And even though I think
Commissioner Douglas

435
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,637
does an outstanding job,

436
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,336
we've had an ongoing
lack of communication

437
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,277
between my office

438
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,509
and you people here
in the trenches.

439
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,243
We want to open
the lines of dialogue...

440
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,841
- Don't interrupt me.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,412
And so I've decided
to create a liaison

442
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,015
between you
and the governor's mansion.

443
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,424
Someone you can go to...

444
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,791
Sorry I'm late.

445
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,127
...someone experienced
in the field

446
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,657
who you can talk to about
any problems that arise,

447
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,500
who can clear up
any changes

448
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,439
in my administration's
prison policies.

449
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,772
And so,

450
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,041
I'd like to present
Eleanor O'Connor.

451
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,311
Thank you, Governor,
Commissioner.

452
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,683
Well, I'm the new kid
in town,

453
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,984
fresh off the boat
from New York City,

454
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,786
where I worked in a similar
capacity for the mayor.

455
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,589
I won't pretend to grasp
all the needs of Oswald,

456
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,028
all of your needs.

457
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,056
But I can promise you that my door
will always be unlocked.

458
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,298
I intend to help cut through
the bureaucracy, the bullshit.

459
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,271
Thank you.

460
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,745
Okay, get yourselves some
cookies and some lemonade.

461
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,681
- Ms. O'Connor...
- Ellie.

462
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,345
Ellie will be hanging around
to meet and greet.

463
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,876
- I have to go.
- Me too.

464
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,922
Ellie, welcome.
I love what you said.

465
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,691
This is the first smart thing
the governor's done in years.

466
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,723
I get the impression
Devlin's not well liked.

467
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,702
Really?
Some of us love him.

468
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,273
- Hello.
- Hello.

469
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,072
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

470
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,343
Tim, wait up.
I'll head back to Em City with you.

471
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,451
- She seems nice, genuine.
- Yeah.

472
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,854
- Do me a favor. Don't try to fuck her.
- What?

473
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,916
Every skirt that crosses
the threshold here, you jump on.

474
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,689
Oh, that is simply
not true.

475
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,925
Wittlesey, Nathan, Howell,
that broad from the State Department.

476
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,263
I'm not gonna be fucking
Eleanor O'Connor.

477
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,530
- Oh no?
- No, 'cause I already did.

478
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,504
- What?
- She's my ex-wife.

479
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,103
You got...
Jeez, man.

480
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,771
In Arkansas, a man

481
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,144
can legally beat
his wife once a month.

482
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,705
In Los Angeles...

483
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,708
pay attention now...
a man can legally beat his wife

484
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:52,280
with a strap as long as the strap
is less than two inches wide.

485
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,484
Or if the woman gives
her husband permission,

486
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,721
he can use any size
strap he wants.

487
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,628
I don't care.
This is not right.

488
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,191
- Leo free?
- No.

489
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,635
- God damn it!
- Who's that?

490
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,969
- Officer Brass.
- This is bullshit!

491
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,874
- Brass!
- If I could get another fucking job

492
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,775
somewhere else,
I'd quit in a second.

493
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,009
But I'm a gimp.
Nobody's hiring gimps these days.

494
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,676
- Dave, what's wrong?
- Wall-to-wall bullshit.

495
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,849
Leo?

496
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,980
He's pissed
I assigned to him to reception

497
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,992
and I won't let him deal
with prisoners... put him back in Unit B.

498
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,721
Well, why won't you?

499
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,252
Tim, if there's trouble,
I need my C.O. S to be agile,

500
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,663
to be able to move, not...

501
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,723
hobble.

502
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,235
All the same,
he was cut on the job.

503
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,261
Hey, and I feel badly for him,
but I'm not running a funhouse.

504
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,969
Brass' desires fall on the far side
of the overall good.

505
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,603
What do you want
to see me about?

506
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,841
Lt'll keep.

507
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,387
Dave, I think
you should sue.

508
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,896
Sue? Sue who?

509
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,899
Oz. The whole prison
system,

510
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,798
the fucking state,
if need be.

511
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,929
- How can I sue?
- Look, I checked this out for you.

512
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,408
In 1990, Congress passed
the Americans with Disabilities Act,

513
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:21,310
which protects the disabled from being
discriminated against in the workplace.

514
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,213
Yeah, but that's like
for wheelchair access and stuff.

515
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,013
No, no, no, not only.
It covers people like you

516
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,281
who, because of their
injuries, are demoted.

517
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,117
Well, I'd have to get
a lawyer.

518
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,350
Well, yeah, but maybe
you should try talking

519
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,325
to this state
liaison person.

520
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,727
This Eleanor O'Connor.
Tell O'Connor how you feel.

521
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,027
Okay, I will.

522
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,193
All right.
And...

523
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,066
don't take
any shit from her.

524
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,613
Still work late, huh?

525
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,451
Yeah, well, you know.

526
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,253
I stopped by earlier,
but you weren't around.

527
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,193
Took a tour
of Emerald City.

528
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,664
It is quite something
you've built here.

529
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,189
Guess it was worth
walking out on me after all.

530
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,567
- Ellie...
- No recriminations, Tim.

531
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,266
You made your choices,
I made mine.

532
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,575
Good to see you.
Want to grab some dinner?

533
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,911
No, thanks. I'm still up to my chest
in cardboard boxes.

534
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,441
Oh, well...
another time then.

535
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:38,216
I had a chat with your friend
Dave Brass.

536
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,588
Sad tale, his.

537
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,389
Promising basketball career
nipped in the Achilles.

538
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,693
Had a chat with the warden too.
He's reassigning him to the cafeteria.

539
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,631
Good.

540
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,827
It'll free up his hours
for physical therapy too.

541
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,632
See, I knew you could
turn the situation around.

542
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,606
- You told him to sue the state?
- Well...

543
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,939
Were you serious
or were you just testing me?

544
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,003
- Both.
- You son of a bitch.

545
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,538
You know what? That's the nicest
thing you ever said to me.

546
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,950
Wait. I'm sure the name calling
will get much worse.

547
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,649
- Looking forward to it.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

548
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,400
Nice try.

549
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,610
Hey, you want
to play some pool?

550
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,080
Still torn up about
that bus accident?

551
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,591
Yeah.

552
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,992
I just talked
to Carrie's parents.

553
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,463
They're in town
for the funeral.

554
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:57,832
They said they're taking Jewel
back to Montana with them.

555
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,394
I might never see
my granddaughter again.

556
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:04,272
Hey, that sucks, Vern,
but what can you do?

557
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,011
You never had kids,
did you?

558
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,240
Nah.

559
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,272
My wife didn't want
to mess with her figure.

560
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,114
Well, then you don't have
a fucking clue what I'm talking about.

561
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,199
Come here, you bitch.
Come over here.

562
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,638
Bye, baby.

563
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,386
Prisoner #97P468:

564
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,446
Charles Pancamo,
a.k.a. Chucky the Enforcer:

565
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,125
Convicted June 4th,
1997:

566
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:02,064
Sentence: 35 years:
Up for parole in 15.

567
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,902
Get your feet off my desk!

568
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,339
All right, I wanted to see all of you
because I've got some news.

569
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,309
Peter Schibetta is
returning to Em City today.

570
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,835
Schibetta? I thought
he was in the loony bin.

571
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,873
Well, not anymore.
He's undergone long-term therapy,

572
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,782
and I'm happy to say
he's recovered.

573
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,151
You mean, he got over
being raped by Adebisi?

574
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,917
I don't want
to minimize his trauma,

575
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,358
or pretend that he's exactly
the way he was before.

576
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,419
But he's learned to accept
and deal with the situation.

577
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,591
Be good to see Petey.
He and me, we came up together.

578
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,569
- And his father...
- Yeah, his father was a legend here.

579
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,505
Yeah. Well...

580
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,906
it's gonna be rough
on him for a few days.

581
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,309
So all I ask is
that you tread lightly.

582
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,373
Don't worry about it, McManus.
We know how to take care of our own.

583
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,753
It's all different, huh?

584
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,387
Yeah, the gas explosion
pretty much obliterated the place.

585
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,727
Good.

586
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,498
There you go.

587
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,670
- Come with me.
- Where?

588
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,908
- The FBI wants to talk to you.
- FBI?

589
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,850
- They fucking want talk to me?
- Just move it, Pancamo.

590
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,991
Do you know a man
named Gaetano Cincetta?

591
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,827
- Not that I recall.
- You don't know him?

592
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,104
- Not that I recall.
- You never met him?

593
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,508
- Not that I recall.
- That's odd.

594
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,445
Mr. Cincetta,
who just blabbed his way

595
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,414
into the witness
protection program,

596
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,747
says you hired him
to kill someone.

597
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,679
Hank Schillinger.
Do you know Hank Schillinger?

598
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,090
- Not that I recall.
- He's the son of Vernon Schillinger.

599
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,822
- Do you know Vernon Schillinger?
- Not that I recall.

600
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,025
He's a fellow resident here at Oswald.
Do you remember him now?

601
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,160
- To the best of my "reciglection"...
- Recollection.

602
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,397
I don't know
the fucking guy.

603
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,930
Chris Keller confessed to hiring
a hit man to kill Hank Schillinger,

604
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,465
only he never identified who.

605
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,534
Mr. Cincetta says
he's never heard of Keller.

606
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,046
We gave Keller
a lie detector test.

607
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,242
Turns out he lied about
his part in the murder.

608
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,217
Now why do you think
Keller would do that?

609
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,380
Nice tie.

610
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,721
Okay.
Officer, take this weasel

611
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,193
back to whatever hole
he crawled out of.

612
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,998
I guess my next conversation's
with Vern Schillinger.

613
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,092
I wonder if he'll
remember you.

614
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,664
He's gonna tell Schillinger
that I ordered the hit.

615
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,974
Then Schillinger's going
to come searching for details.

616
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,913
Fuck!

617
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,440
You know, when I asked you to hire
somebody to kill Hank Schillinger,

618
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:11,285
you said nobody would find the body,
not in a million years.

619
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:15,452
You guaranteed it. Well, it only took
six fucking months.

620
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,018
Seems like you did
a really half-assed job.

621
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,587
Hey, you be careful.
To be honest,

622
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,395
Gaetano Cincetta
was a big disappointment.

623
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,231
Schillinger's gonna
cut off my balls

624
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,362
- if he finds out the truth.
- He won't.

625
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,273
Look, it was my screw-up,
so I'm gonna cover for you.

626
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,341
I'll sleep well tonight.

627
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,607
That's the thing about Oz,
you know,

628
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,652
you try to put
the shit behind you,

629
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,522
you make a real effort.

630
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:51,460
And just when you're thinking,
"maybe I have,"

631
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,896
more shit comes flying.

632
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,528
You sure it was Pancamo
put the mark on Hank?

633
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,663
Absolutely sure.

634
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,846
Hey, you, you fucking dago!

635
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,441
You killed my son.

636
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,533
I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

637
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,470
Just give me
a fucking band-aid.

638
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,475
Let's see. Okay.
Whoop.

639
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,220
Jimmy?

640
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,392
What's going on?

641
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,163
The Aryans attacked
the Sicilians.

642
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:42,298
Pancamo hired the hit man
to kill Hank Schillinger.

643
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,239
Oh, I see.

644
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,402
Keller wasn't involved
in Hank's death,

645
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,537
so Massachusetts has
no reason to hold him.

646
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:53,846
- Wait. That means...
- Chris Keller is coming back to Oz.

647
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,691
McManus, hold up, hold up.

648
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,390
- Can... can I have a word with you?
- Sorry, I'm on the run.

649
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,160
Oh, please don't
do me like this, man.

650
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,096
Heartless motherfucker.

651
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,867
What the fuck
did you say to me?

652
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,966
I got a big heart
a few days ago.

653
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,705
- Now I'm fucking heartless?
- I didn't mean it, okay?

654
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,475
Well, I'm here.
What do you want?

655
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,245
I know that you done everything
that you can to help me.

656
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,712
But sitting here,

657
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,086
I've come up
with a whole new solution.

658
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,217
If I could just, you know,
hang with you a bit, you know.

659
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,160
No, no, no, no,
not like before.

660
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,653
Just if I could chill in your office,
you know, just from time to time.

661
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,167
No!
Jesus Christ!

662
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,533
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

663
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,097
I mean, yo,
you're the only friend I got here.

664
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,303
I mean, just anything.
Just to have somebody to talk to.

665
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,404
All right, vacation's over.
Come on, White. Out.

666
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,850
- Help me, please.
- I'll try to think of something, okay?

667
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,828
What am I supposed to do
while you think?

668
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,659
If it takes staying
in your cell 24/7

669
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,255
to steer clear
of trouble...

670
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,324
That... that's worse
than the cage.

671
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,529
That'd be like
being back in solitary.

672
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,367
Damn.

673
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,019
Take that bread
out of your mouth.

674
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,053
- Sorry, Minister.
- Oh, you're sorry?

675
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,964
- Yes, Minister, forgive me.
- Get up,

676
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,127
- walk away.
- What?

677
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,763
You can't quell your desire
for even a moment

678
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,501
in order to give thanks
and praise to Allah?

679
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,573
Grab your tray.

680
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,547
Take off your keffiye.

681
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,579
Imam, you're being
too severe.

682
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,586
Are you
contesting me, Arif?

683
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,418
Brother Lalar is new
to the fold. Scold him,

684
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,788
take away his food,
but don't cast him out.

685
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,887
You're sitting down?

686
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,793
You'll sit down?

687
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,094
Did I tell you to sit down!
You cannot sit down!

688
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,600
Hey! Hey!

689
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,126
Did I tell you
you can sit down! Did I?

690
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,275
So what was
all that about?

691
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,334
Why'd you attack
Ahmad Lalar?

692
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,107
You keep me
from going to the hole,

693
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,376
- so in return I answer questions?
- Yeah.

694
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:42,044
Although part of me thinks I'm not gonna
get any answers from you.

695
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,111
I mean, a man who used
to fight with words

696
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,987
is now not only using his fists,
he's choking Muslims.

697
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,357
I'll give you 10-to-one odds
you don't have the slightest clue

698
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,624
why you're doing
the things you're doing.

699
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,029
And you would lose the bet.

700
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,028
The day Adebisi died,
I changed

701
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,935
and I took his life
to save my own.

702
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,532
That was the Adebisi side of me
coming to the surface.

703
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,375
Only now I realize it hasn't
just come to the surface.

704
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,710
It's at the very center
of who I am.

705
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,216
Bullshit.

706
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,309
Everybody's got demons.

707
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:18,116
But you've given all
the weight of who you are

708
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,386
over to this horrible shit
you're discovering about yourself.

709
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,155
Yet you're more equipped
than any other prisoner in Oz

710
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,719
to straighten yourself out,
and you know it.

711
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:31,326
And knowing that and having failed
to do so has fucked you up even more.

712
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,734
- Just put me in the hole.
- I'm not putting you in the hole.

713
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,535
- Please.
- I'm giving you a job instead.

714
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:40,009
- A job?
- You want to save yourself, Kareem?

715
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,414
Yes.

716
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,746
Well, I want you
to save somebody else.

717
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,846
What you looking at?

718
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,858
What's he doing here?

719
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,027
What the fuck is he
looking at me like that for?

720
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,963
I'm the one
who's gonna help you.

721
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,660
I don't need no motherfucking help,
especially from him.

722
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,499
- What he gonna do for me?
- Kareem's gonna be your new sponsor.

723
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,528
- Sponsor?
- Starting today, you and I

724
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,268
will share the same pod.
We will exercise together,

725
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,004
we will eat together,
we will work alongside of each other.

726
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,535
You still need to meet
with Sister Pete for counseling,

727
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,515
and your attendance is mandatory
at all drug rehab sessions.

728
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,178
Plus the warden wants you tested
for drugs once a week.

729
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,914
Now, Omar,

730
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,650
this is your last play,
and it's fourth and long.

731
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,558
You miss one meeting, you get in
one fight, you piss Said off one time,

732
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,927
it's back to solitary permanently.
You understand me?

733
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,400
All right.

734
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:43,031
Hey, yeah.
Yeah.

735
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,078
Yeah, boy.

736
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,182
My boy is something else,
ain't he?

737
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:05,491
McManus, jack. That motherfucker's
like a straight up brainiac, you know?

738
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:09,056
A genius motherfucker
and shit, boy. Shit.

739
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,000
He be coming up with all kind
of little ways, you know, and shit,

740
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,094
you know, to help
me try to lick my...

741
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,437
what's it called?
Shortcomings.

742
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:21,570
Yeah, and I done fucked with him
a couple of times too, and shit.

743
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,070
But you know what? Having me,
you know, all up in your draft and shit,

744
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,414
picking up all the, you know,
Saidian vibrations...

745
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,216
First of all,
don't hustle me.

746
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,223
Whoa,
hold up, baby.

747
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,316
Yo, you got to chill, baby.

748
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,351
Second of all,
I am not your baby.

749
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:43,128
My name is Minister Said,
and you will address me as such.

750
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,136
No, no, no, fuck that shit.
I told you, man, about that shit.

751
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,365
You're not coming up here,
converting my ass.

752
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,498
Man, that shit is out.
Forget it.

753
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,941
I am not converting you.

754
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,578
Also, I am not going
to argue with you.

755
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,478
So this thing is over.

756
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,073
- Get out.
- What?

757
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,576
- Out.
- Whoa...

758
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,486
Look, shut the door,
all right?

759
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,788
I'm sorry.
Shut it, please.

760
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,852
Make your bed.

761
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,624
Make... your bed.

762
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:41,554
I will not fight.

763
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,493
- You talking to me?
- Say it,

764
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,519
"I will not fight."

765
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,198
I will not fight.

766
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,727
Again.

767
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,732
I will not fight.

768
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,266
From now on, that
will be your mantra.

769
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,575
Every time another inmate
gets in your face,

770
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,583
you will say,
"I will not fight."

771
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,552
You will say it
over and over,

772
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,349
out loud
if you have to.

773
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,725
- I will not fight.
- Yeah.

774
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,659
I will not fight.

775
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,562
I will not fight.
I will not fight.

776
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,066
If I could just
conquer not fighting...

777
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:27,730
Shit, I'm home free, boy.
I mean, there's nothing in the world

778
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,501
I hate more than
motherfucking solitary.

779
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:36,003
If I go back in there,
the fucking worms.

780
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:39,743
Worms? What are you
talking about, worms?

781
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,116
In my head, man.
Every time I go back, it's the worms.

782
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,790
Fat ones, big ones,
old ones.

783
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,854
I can't survive
the fucking worms!

784
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:55,865
I think about spending
the rest of my life

785
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:59,562
in this Em City...

786
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,970
for eight... 18,000 days,

787
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,002
23,000 days.

788
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,447
That's a lot of days.

789
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,883
A lot of days not to fight,
not to get high.

790
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,752
Think about it like that...

791
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,220
the chances
don't look too good.

792
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,768
In Nogales, Arizona,

793
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,404
it's illegal to wear
suspenders.

794
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,744
You gotta wonder
what happened.

795
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,841
What cataclysmic event occurred
which caused the city fathers

796
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:51,047
to decree that in our town
no one, under any circumstances,

797
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,680
can wear suspenders?

798
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,715
And are there radical
fringe groups in Nogales

799
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,694
who meet at night in secret,
who slip off their belts

800
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,926
and in defiance of the law
put these suckers on? Huh?

801
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:05,162
- How's Cloutier?
- Oh, his vital signs are stable,

802
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,193
but he still can't
move very much.

803
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,762
- Is he talking yet?
- Um...

804
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,468
No, only
guttural sounds.

805
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,410
- Could I see him?
- Ray, he's pretty disfigured.

806
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,005
I was assistant chaplain
at Benchley Memorial

807
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,482
when I was a seminarian.
I've seen burn victims.

808
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,690
Oh, sweet Jesus.

809
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,997
Jeremiah?

810
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,474
If you don't mind,
I'd like to say a prayer.

811
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:54,379
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

812
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:57,148
hallowed be Thy name.

813
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,714
- Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

814
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,885
on earth
as it is in heaven.

815
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,760
Give us this day
our daily bread

816
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,789
and forgive us
our trespasses...

817
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,470
It's open.

818
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,335
- Mukada?
- Come in.

819
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,539
Leave the door open.

820
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,047
What did you need
to see me about?

821
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,054
I heard that you're planning
a memorial service

822
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,387
to honor the victims for the families
who were killed in the bus crash.

823
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,892
Yes. I've asked Arif
and Rabbi Gold

824
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,124
and Reverend Taylor
from the First Baptist to participate.

825
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,961
- But not me.
- You?

826
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,696
Ever since Jeremiah Cloutier's
unfortunate accident...

827
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:50,194
I would hardly call being
bricked up into a wall accidental.

828
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,334
I meant the third-degree burns
he suffered from the gas explosion.

829
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,470
- Oh.
- Since then, I've been ministering

830
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,538
to many of the Christians
in Oz.

831
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,812
Getting up on stage
and reading from a Bible

832
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,046
doesn't constitute
a ministry.

833
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,914
You're still holding a grudge
because I rejected Romanism.

834
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:12,054
No, I'm glad you're no longer
part of my congregation.

835
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,292
I demand to be included
in the ecumenical service.

836
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,961
- You're not qualified.
- I'm an ordained priest.

837
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,698
Since when?

838
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:25,299
I signed up by mail.
50 bucks. See?

839
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,174
Get out of my office.

840
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,746
I'll go over your head,
to the warden.

841
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,306
Yeah, and he'll ignore you.

842
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,148
Then I'll go over
his head to God.

843
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,154
Listen, you little punk,

844
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,248
we know that you were
involved in Cloutier's accident.

845
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,521
And as soon as he's able
to talk, to testify,

846
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,427
you're going to solitary
for the rest of your goddamn life!

847
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,801
We have to kill
Cloutier right now.

848
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,327
His throat's still sore from the burns,
but when he's well,

849
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,636
he's going to sing
and we'll all be up shit's creek.

850
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,665
Look, I'm already up
the creek, pal. Okay?

851
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,041
Look, Jaz, I know that
because you were the one

852
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,943
in charge
of the work detail that day,

853
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,039
you've taken the heat
for the rest of us.

854
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,949
But that's no reason
that Cloutier should live.

855
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,453
Look, he dies,
the hacks blame me.

856
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,184
Right, so the person
who kills him

857
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:17,682
has to be
above reproach.

858
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,786
Jim?

859
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,060
No, I can't.

860
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,794
Cloutier brought me
to Jesus.

861
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,826
Jim, if you're not part of the solution,
you're Satan's tool.

862
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:32,774
Yeah. Do the deed, or die.

863
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,931
Jim?

864
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,936
Jim Burns?

865
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,336
Those men want you
to kill me, Jim,

866
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,307
but you know that
what they ask is wrong.

867
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:08,334
- Yes.
- So I say unto you,

868
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,209
kill them.

869
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,080
Kill Hoyt and Kirk.

870
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,591
The Reverend Cloutier was
in my cell last night.

871
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,930
- For what, a blowjob?
- This ain't funny.

872
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:34,095
- You had a dream.
- It was no dream.

873
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,300
- Chickenshit.
- You're trying to get out of the job.

874
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,570
Go kill the cocksucker.

875
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,940
- No!
- No?

876
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,501
He told me to kill you!

877
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,299
It's self-defense.

878
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,393
It's... it's motherfucking
self-defense.

879
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,529
I got witnesses.
You got nothing on me.

880
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,596
There was fucking
10 guys there.

881
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,608
Put him in the hole.

882
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,045
Self-defense!

883
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:25,816
Will we be having
a service for Jim?

884
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,320
Yes, of course.

885
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,385
We must pray
for his immortal soul.

886
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,592
Lights out!

887
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,861
Manmade laws are arbitrary,
transitory.

888
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,393
What was perfectly
legal yesterday

889
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:45,272
suddenly becomes a felony today
with the stroke of some president's pen.

890
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:49,039
The laws of god, however,
are carved in stone.

891
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,808
They do not change.

892
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,940
And when you break
God's law,

893
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,008
you don't go to prison,
you go to hell.

894
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,279
And you burn.

895
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,202
Hoyt!

896
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,384
Don't be afraid.
