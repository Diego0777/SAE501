1
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:43,646
Six percent
of the total prison population

2
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:45,815
is 55 and older.

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,442
That's double 1 0 years ago.

4
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,739
And we say 55 is old

5
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:54,614
because criminal life adds about
ten years' worth of wrinkles.

6
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,915
Still, in Oz, you get decent food,

7
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,125
exercise, regular checkups.

8
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,494
And if you don't get whacked,

9
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:02,749
you'll live longer than you would
in your own hood.

10
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,218
Yeah, the prison system.

11
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:14,512
lt can keep you alive,
but it can't take care of you.

12
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,726
l'm telling you,
we're ignoring the problem.

13
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,771
We have to deal differently
with aging inmates.

14
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,313
That's right. Oz was designed
to punish the young,

15
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:23,193
to keep them in line,
to keep them down,

16
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:26,363
but with a guy like Rebadow,
we don't need to keep him down.

17
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:27,907
So, what are you proposing?

18
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:31,195
We turn Unit 2 into a cellblock
exclusively for seniors.

19
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:34,081
They sleep together there,
eat all their meals together there,

20
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:37,249
they can play cards, they can watch
the TV shows they wanna watch.

21
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,037
Saturday night Bingo?

22
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,785
Well, why not?
We need to keep them active.

23
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,675
And less stress will help
slow down the aging process,

24
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,633
which will help save
on medical costs.

25
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,676
Plus, the older guys aren't
a security problem,

26
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:50,506
so you can save money
on the officers.

27
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,677
McManus,
you've been awfully quiet today.

28
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:57,184
Never thought l'd ask,
but do you have an opinion on this?

29
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:59,680
Sure. Sounds like a good idea.

30
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:03,848
- That's it?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:07,858
Fine, l'll run it by the commissioner.

32
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,657
Meeting adjourned.

33
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,735
Finally.

34
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,579
Hey, Tim, you okay?

35
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
You don't look so good.

36
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,505
- Are you feeling all right?
- l said yeah, okay?

37
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,257
Okay.

38
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,501
Free for dinner tonight?

39
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,134
Dinner? You think l'm an asshole.

40
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:34,506
- l do not think--
- Well, l appreciate the offer,

41
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:38,302
but the last thing l need from you
is a mercy dinner.

42
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,523
Bob Rebadow's in the hospital, Kenny.

43
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:47,730
- So?
- So l'm pissed off about that.

44
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,574
- So?
- So l hear you're responsible.

45
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,022
Where'd you hear that from?

46
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:55,534
l got ears everywhere, Kenny.
l know it's true.

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,872
You don't hit old men, Kenny.

48
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,745
- You don't hit old men.
- What do you want, McManus?

49
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,000
You see those guys out there?

50
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,712
lf l tell them to,
they will gladly kick your ass.

51
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,759
l'm not afraid of them.
l'm not afraid of you.

52
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,174
- You're not?
- No.

53
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,806
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

54
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:16,219
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

55
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,515
You afraid of this, huh?

56
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:22,683
You afraid of dying?
You little fucking punkass!

57
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,895
Get him the fuck out of here.

58
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:53,469
Leo, what are you doing here?

59
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,762
Same thing you are, l guess.

60
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,888
l like to work out
when no one else is around.

61
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:00,632
l'll ignore you if you ignore me.

62
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,651
McManus, you okay?

63
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:11,396
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

64
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,573
l don't know.
Past few weeks, you seem different.

65
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,450
l'm fine.

66
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:22,113
Commissioner rejected our proposal
for a senior-citizens unit.

67
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,833
Big surprise.

68
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:27,536
Commissioner didn't reject it.
Governor Fuckwad did.

69
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:30,922
Well, Devlin's almost out of office.

70
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,333
l mean, he's on trial
for taking those kickbacks,

71
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:37,045
for lying, fraud, extortion.

72
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:39,174
l'll miss him.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,683
You know,
l've been hearing rumours

74
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,689
that you're living in Emerald City,
that you never leave the grounds,

75
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:50,273
- never go home anymore.
- Since when do you listen to gossip?

76
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:53,778
You know, l've been dancing
down these hallways a long time.

77
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:56,106
l've seen this place
change people completely,

78
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:57,943
not just the prisoners.

79
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:00,158
lf you're not careful, Tim,

80
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,867
Oz will nick away at your soul.

81
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,580
That's the first time
you ever called me Tim.

82
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:14,546
You know, you don't even
have to be 55 to be old.

83
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,091
- Take a break.
- Okay, Mr. McManus.

84
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,955
How you feeling?

85
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,991
l can't stay here anymore.

86
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:50,494
- ln the hospital?
- ln Oz.

87
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,088
Why?

88
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:53,750
l'm afraid.

89
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:55,383
Of what?

90
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,962
Them. The young.

91
00:06:57,136 --> 00:07:00,172
When l first came to Oz,
we treated our elders with dignity.

92
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,506
But these kids, it's all different now.

93
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:05,183
l've decided to leave.

94
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:06,841
Leave?

95
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:08,683
Escape.

96
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,477
How you gonna do that?

97
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:16,059
God will show me the way.

98
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:06,526
The human body.

99
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,039
lt's amazing.

100
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,043
Made up of all these cells

101
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:15,911
and neutrons and veins
and shit like that.

102
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,044
So many little pieces, so many things
that could break down.

103
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:21,626
And add on to that the wear
and tear we give our bodies,

104
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:25,504
what with the drugs and drinking
and chicken-fried steak.

105
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,259
Man, that any of us
are still standing,

106
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:31,306
still breathing, it's a miracle.

107
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,102
Breakfast time, boys!

108
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:36,399
Let's go, Alvarez.

109
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,403
- l think maybe we got a problem.
- What?

110
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,777
Look at Alvarez.

111
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:57,081
- Hey, Alvarez.
- You think he's faking?

112
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,165
Alvarez.

113
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,134
Alvarez.

114
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:04,338
Alvarez.

115
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,758
Call for the doctor.

116
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:13,976
Prisoner number 43A5 1 5,
Ricardo Alvarez.

117
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:17,108
Convicted March 3, '43.
Armed robbery.

118
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:19,275
Sentence: 20 years.

119
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:22,737
Convicted June 6, '6 1.
Murder in the first degree.

120
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:27,533
Sentence: Life imprisonment,
solitary confinement.

121
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,577
Ricardo, we're gonna start
with a series of tests.

122
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,504
You have to go home?

123
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:45,756
Your mother--
Ricardo, where are you?

124
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:48,890
Do you know what city you're in?

125
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:55,846
Havana. Havana.

126
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:59,393
So we're agreed? The medication's
controlling Cragen's paranoia.

127
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:02,355
- Yeah, we should keep him on it.
- Definitely.

128
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,199
Thank you. Next is Miguel Alvarez.

129
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:10,028
Oh, yeah. l'm scheduled to do a
psychiatric re-evaluation on Thursday.

130
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:12,991
Good luck, Pete.
His baby died right after birth.

131
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:14,244
He's pretty depressed.

132
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,076
He's about to become
even more depressed.

133
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:18,291
His grandfather, Ricardo Alvarez,
has Alzheimer's.

134
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:20,746
- Christ.
- Does his family know?

135
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,251
No, not yet.

136
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,501
Ricardo's son Eduardo
is an orderly in my ward.

137
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,504
l'll tell him when he comes in
for his shift.

138
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,134
Eduardo.
That's the one with no tongue, right?

139
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:30,765
l'll talk to Miguel.

140
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:34,267
Listen, Tim, can l do that?
lf you don't mind.

141
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:36,809
Hey, l'm always willing
to give up an opportunity

142
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:39,732
to deliver bad news. Next?

143
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,521
Miguel, l need you to come with me.

144
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:45,186
- l didn't do shit.
- Miguel, please.

145
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:46,823
Come on.

146
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,908
How come no one knew till now
that Ricardo's mind was going?

147
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,412
He was in solitary, Miguel.

148
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,458
He hardly says three words a day
to anyone.

149
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:03,163
And there's nothing we could've done
to stop the disease anyway.

150
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:06,174
So, what happens now?

151
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,135
Well, that's the tricky part.

152
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:11,554
Unfortunately, Oz is just not equipped
for long-term custodial care

153
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:14,393
and there isn't anywhere else
to send him.

154
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,846
The state doesn't have a place
to take care of its old prisoners?

155
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:21,225
The state. The state's attitude
toward the elderly,

156
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,187
any elderly, in or out of prison...

157
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,021
...is hurry up and die.

158
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:31,316
l wanna see my grandfather.

159
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

160
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:54,844
lt's me, Miguel, and Eduardo.

161
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:58,551
Hey.

162
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,847
Eduardo, your son.

163
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,728
- Miguel, grandson.
- Hey.

164
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:09,821
Hey.

165
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,566
Hey, hey, hey.

166
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:18,830
You know what we should do
with Ricardo Alvarez?

167
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,083
What's that?

168
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,959
Let him go free.

169
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,921
Let him go free?
The man is a convicted killer.

170
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,175
He stabbed the inmate
who cut his son's tongue out.

171
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,178
- And he's old.
- He's old, Leo.

172
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,262
Old doesn't necessarily mean nice.

173
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:43,146
lf there's any doubts about that,

174
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:45,474
spend ten minutes
with my mother-in-law.

175
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:49,696
Leo, a 31 -year-old inmate
costs $21 ,000 a year to maintain.

176
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:52,070
A senior costs
three times that amount.

177
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,280
Since when did you get so interested
in the budget?

178
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,528
Since l figured out
that the money we're gonna waste

179
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,242
taking care of Ricardo Alvarez
could be put to much better use.

180
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:02,332
Besides, Ricardo doesn't know
where he is or even why he's here.

181
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:05,123
There is such a thing
as criminal menopause, right?

182
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,169
Look, he cannot commit
the crime again.

183
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:09,047
The man is no longer
a threat to anybody.

184
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:12,175
lt doesn't change what he did,
and it doesn't change his sentence.

185
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,384
Life imprisonment means just that.

186
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,797
Besides, if he really doesn't know
he's in prison,

187
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:19,512
then he's already free, isn't he?

188
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:27,519
When l was growing up,
both my father and my grandfather

189
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,436
came to Oz.

190
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:32,566
You know, when l was little,
l always wondered

191
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,200
what was so great about prison that
they'd wanna leave us and come here.

192
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:42,119
But you're a kid, you know.
What do you know?

193
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,613
Yeah.

194
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,211
So the word ''grandfather.''

195
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,673
What does the word
mean to you, emotionally?

196
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:53,502
Nothing.

197
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,795
Don't mean nothing at all to me.

198
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,429
''Pizza'' means more.

199
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,886
''Doorknob.''

200
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:06,727
Would you like ''grandfather''
to mean something to you?

201
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:09,853
Yeah.

202
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:15,275
Dr. Nathan's not sure how long
your grandfather has to live.

203
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:20,990
Look, since your father's an orderly
in the prison hospital

204
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,281
and is gonna spend time
with your grandfather,

205
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,331
there's no reason
you can't do the same thing.

206
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:27,790
Maybe if you take care of him,

207
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:30,369
you'll learn to care for him.

208
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,378
You know, in my family,

209
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,511
Ricardo was like a god.

210
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,389
You know, he was a legend.

211
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:42,883
My grandmother used to show me
these pictures,

212
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:45,854
you know,
telling me stories all about him.

213
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:50,313
And l wanted to be like him,
you know.

214
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:51,943
Yeah.

215
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:57,443
Now l see he's just a man.

216
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,073
You know, he's just an old man

217
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,569
and he's rotting away.

218
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,207
l don't wanna end up
like my grandfather.

219
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,326
You don't have to, Miguel.

220
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:10,294
Oh, really?

221
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:14,591
Well, l don't see it going down
any other way.

222
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:26,388
Rebadow.

223
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:30,270
Hey, l'm sorry you didn't make it out.

224
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,932
lt's okay. lt was worth it.

225
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:39,647
The adrenaline rush.
l felt 25 again for a moment.

226
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,408
- Here's your dinner.
- l don't want it.

227
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,122
Okay.

228
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:48,248
What do you want?

229
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:53,704
l'd like a few years at the end of my life
to be free.

230
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,181
Do we care for people
when they're sick

231
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:05,804
because we actually
care about them?

232
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,679
Or do we care for them
because when our time comes,

233
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,938
we want someone to care for us?

234
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:18,278
Or does it matter?

235
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,741
At least you got your health.

236
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,068
Don't you hate it
when people say that?

237
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:29,374
l mean, you lose your job,
you lose your wife, you're in prison,

238
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,253
and some punkass dude gonna say,
''At least you got your health.''

239
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,412
Like that's supposed to
make you feel better.

240
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,666
So what if l'm broke, or if some
drug dealer wants to cap my ass?

241
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:39,300
At least l ain't got a tumour.

242
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,926
l swear, the next person
that says ALYG YH to me,

243
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:45,670
l'm gonna make sure they ain't got
their health much longer.

244
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,352
You say you were having nightmares.

245
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,263
Can you remember any of them?

246
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:52,849
No.

247
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,275
What's the matter?

248
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,269
My tooth hurts.

249
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:59,521
lt's been hurting for a week.

250
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:02,651
- Then go see a dentist.
- No.

251
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,274
- Why?
- l hate the dentist.

252
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:08,370
All dentists,
or just Dr. Kochurn in particular?

253
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:10,490
The concept of dentists.

254
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,869
Then what?
You prefer the concept of pain?

255
00:17:14,462 --> 00:17:17,581
Make an appointment, Groves, okay?

256
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:19,215
Okay?

257
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,135
- Oh, God.
- What?

258
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:26,755
Oh, sweet Jesus,
Donald Groves is coming in to see me.

259
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:30,301
- So?
- Gloria, he ate his parents.

260
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:32,684
l'm not sticking my fingers
in his mouth.

261
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,474
My fingers are my livelihood.

262
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,522
He's been working in the ward
as an orderly.

263
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:37,937
He seems harmless.

264
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,937
So you'd stick your fingers
in his mouth?

265
00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:42,899
lf l had to.
lf he's in pain, you have to.

266
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:45,487
- No, l don't.
- What about the Hippocratic Oath?

267
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,777
Dentists don't take
the Hippocratic Oath.

268
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:50,242
We don't make any promises
to anybody.

269
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,994
How's that gas working?

270
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,747
You feel happy?

271
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:59,416
Calm?

272
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:01,752
Good.

273
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,802
Okay, let's have a look.

274
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:07,679
Open your mouth.

275
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:12,427
Wider. Wider. Wider.

276
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,971
- l can't get any wider.
- Alrighty then.

277
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,266
They look fine.

278
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,855
- lt hurts.
- lt's probably nothing.

279
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:23,357
- lt hurts.
- Don't be a baby.

280
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:26,282
- Who you calling a baby?
- Nobody.

281
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,954
Forget it. Forget l said anything.

282
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,493
There is a tooth that's rotted out.
So we're going to have to pull it.

283
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:38,752
That means l have to take a needle,
inject some Novocaine in your mouth.

284
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:40,795
- l hate needles.
- Everybody does.

285
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,919
- Then l have to drill.
- l hate drills.

286
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:45,967
Right now, so do l.

287
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:49,179
Right now, l wish there were
holistic dentistry.

288
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,670
l'm in pain.

289
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,554
Well, you're going to be in a lot more
before we're finished.

290
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,521
But after that,
you won't have any pain, see.

291
00:18:56,689 --> 00:19:01,018
lf l cause you pain, it's not my fault,
so don't bite my head off.

292
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,901
l mean...

293
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:06,942
- l know what you mean.
- Okay.

294
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:11,279
Let's get started.
First, the Novocaine.

295
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,738
Open wide.

296
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,713
Carol,

297
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,081
could you
give me a hand here, please?

298
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:34,682
This is my tooth. lt was in my head.

299
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,479
This tooth and l have been together
since we were kids.

300
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,394
This tooth chewed on my mom.

301
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:50,522
You should sell it.

302
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:52,617
- Sell it?
- Sell it.

303
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:54,370
Tooth from the mouth
of Donald Groves?

304
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:56,365
Know how much that's worth
on the market?

305
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,699
- How much?
- Plenty.

306
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:01,291
- Who'd wanna buy my tooth?
- Collectors.

307
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:03,086
- Collectors?
- Collectors.

308
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,497
People collect everything.

309
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:09,043
Stamps, salt and pepper shakers,
World's Fair tchotchkes.

310
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,296
Some people collect crime stuff.

311
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:12,966
Lindbergh ladder,

312
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,382
Ted Bundy's toenail clippings,

313
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,766
and this.

314
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:20,307
We'd have to get a fence, right?

315
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,096
We're in prison.
How hard's that gonna be?

316
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:26,768
Ross, if we get a good price...

317
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:31,148
...l still got 30 more.

318
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,490
The mind is just like the body.

319
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,033
lt's under constant assault

320
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:41,625
from fear and hate
and a whole pile of loneliness.

321
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:45,329
These things are as deadly
as any cancer cell.

322
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:48,839
The mind is just like the body.

323
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,927
The fact that the mind can survive

324
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,303
is a miracle.

325
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,970
Okay. All right. Yo. All right.

326
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,131
Our next contestant

327
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:42,183
is the lovely and talented
Tobias Beecher.

328
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:07,036
He never treats me sweet and gentle

329
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:11,374
The way he should

330
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,509
l've got it bad

331
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,931
And that ain't good

332
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:27,686
When the weekend's over

333
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:33,981
And Monday rolls around

334
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:39,738
l end up like l start out

335
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:45,826
Crying my heart out

336
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,745
He don't love me

337
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:52,755
Like l love him

338
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,874
Nobody could

339
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:01,717
l've got it bad

340
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:06,222
And that ain't good

341
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,350
l've got it bad

342
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:19,359
And that ain't

343
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:26,449
Good

344
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:47,262
Yo, chill, y'all rowdy-ass
motherfuckers. Shut up.

345
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:52,775
Yo, next up on the stage...

346
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,822
All right, all right. Next on stage,
our very own George Bailey

347
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:03,033
doing a drum solo.

348
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:07,240
Well, we knew Beecher
was doing drugs.

349
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,332
Yeah, but now l'm beginning
to figure it out.

350
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:12,502
He thinks of himself as a victim,
so he's not gonna get better

351
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,997
unless he feels
he can control his life.

352
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:18,424
He's in prison, Pete Marie.
His life is totally out of his control.

353
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:21,132
Well, now we have to get him
back to when he was in charge.

354
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:24,092
We have to remind him that
there's another victim involved here,

355
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,595
the little girl he killed.

356
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,920
Hello.

357
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:06,129
My husband wouldn't come.

358
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:10,427
He said he was afraid
he might kill you.

359
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:24,859
This is Kathy.

360
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:33,287
l'm sorry, l didn't mean to...

361
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:42,459
l'm not sure why l came.

362
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:46,806
At the trial,
l was sitting behind you.

363
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:49,306
l could barely see your face.

364
00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:53,100
Guess l just wanted to finally...

365
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:56,647
...see you.

366
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,983
See your eyes, and to tell you...

367
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,073
...that l miss her.

368
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:12,574
Every single moment
of every single day.

369
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:20,377
You fucking bastard!

370
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:23,462
l hope you die in here,
you motherfucking--!

371
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:26,299
l hope you rot in hell!

372
00:26:26,472 --> 00:26:30,339
You killed my baby!

373
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:32,185
l don't know.

374
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:36,521
Maybe l let Schillinger
treat me like dirt

375
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,897
because l deserve to be punished.

376
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:40,776
Because l--

377
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:44,562
l killed Kathy Rockwell.

378
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:50,988
Because l destroyed her family.

379
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:53,909
And my own.

380
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,372
And you hate yourself for that?

381
00:26:57,962 --> 00:26:59,753
Yes.

382
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:06,882
l guess l hated myself
back before, too, you know.

383
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:09,094
l hated myself, so l drank too much.

384
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:11,880
Then l hated myself
for drinking too much

385
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,060
so to punish myself,
l drank more.

386
00:27:18,065 --> 00:27:19,690
Sister...

387
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:28,396
...l don't wanna hate me anymore.

388
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:42,169
Hey, don't think you're fooling me.

389
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:45,501
l know the only way you got through
that variety show was by using drugs.

390
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:46,921
- Look, l--
- Hey,

391
00:27:47,094 --> 00:27:49,550
l told you,
l don't want you doing that shit.

392
00:27:51,557 --> 00:27:53,466
l'm sorry, sir.

393
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:58,808
No, l'm sorry.

394
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,356
Here. Put it on.

395
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:16,165
Perfect fit.
No, no, no. Leave it on.

396
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:18,786
Perfect fit.
No, no, no. Leave it on.

397
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:21,830
Come on.

398
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:25,084
lf l go out there with this on,
a black guy is gonna kill me.

399
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:27,341
Yeah, l know.

400
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:31,632
What is this?

401
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:34,971
There's a new kid in town.

402
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:43,183
Okay, that's great.

403
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,435
l'm happy for you.
l'll move to another pod.

404
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,939
No.

405
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,070
Why not?

406
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,861
l don't want some nigger
to have your ass.

407
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:00,206
Goodbye, prag.

408
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,593
- O'Reily, l need your help.
- Well, l'm here.

409
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:24,105
Schillinger wants me dead.
He just gave me this to wear.

410
00:29:26,402 --> 00:29:27,813
What am l gonna do, man?

411
00:29:27,987 --> 00:29:30,822
Well, if you gotta go,
you gotta go high.

412
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:33,822
Ever tried PCP?

413
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:36,697
The trial of James Devlin
opened today at the state courthouse,

414
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,329
not far from the capital building,

415
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:41,617
where the governor has ruled
with an iron fist for the past year.

416
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:44,912
Devlin, who says he will not resign
even if convicted,

417
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:46,789
faces 25 years in prison

418
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:50,167
for fraud, extortion, racketeering,
and obstruction of justice.

419
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:25,993
Yeah, motherfucker! How's that?

420
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,747
l'm sorry, sir.

421
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:29,292
l'm getting out of here!

422
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,585
- Beecher, get down.
- Here l go!

423
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:39,842
No way out of here, you fucking
cocksucking, motherfucking--

424
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,850
Someone get a fucking doctor!

425
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,104
How does that feel, you cunt?

426
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:48,681
Beecher! Beecher! Beecher!

427
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:53,861
You better get a fucking doctor!

428
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:02,163
Help me! Help!

429
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:05,327
- Keep your hands out of your face.
- Oh, shit.

430
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,992
l need a couple of 4-by-4's
and some tape.

431
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:11,581
The glass in his eye is pretty bad.
l'm not sure l can save it.

432
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:13,335
We need to get him
to Benchley Memorial

433
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,252
for surgery as soon as possible.

434
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,925
Fuck, l'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

435
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:20,760
Beecher, you're a dead man!

436
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:22,761
You have to go back
to drug counselling.

437
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:24,215
- Fuck off.
- lf you don't,

438
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,637
- l'll transfer you out of Emerald City.
- Fuck off.

439
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:29,228
- Tobias, we're trying to help you.
- Fuck off!

440
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:32,608
Look, if you're afraid
Schillinger's gonna kill you,

441
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,729
l'll place you
under protective custody.

442
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:41,780
Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off,
fuck off, fuck off, you fucks.

443
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:42,037
People say, ''She broke my heart.''
That's bullshit, man.

444
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:45,620
People say, ''She broke my heart.''
That's bullshit, man.

445
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,456
The heart can't break, it's a muscle.

446
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,003
Muscles tear, muscles cramp.

447
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:54,249
Yeah, the heart's a muscle.

448
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,673
So's the brain. So's the dick.

449
00:31:56,886 --> 00:32:00,718
O'Reily, give this guy the mop.

450
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:03,173
You're through
with the bucket brigade.

451
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:05,387
Good.

452
00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:11,347
Dino Ortolani ran the kitchen
like a Swiss watch. The best.

453
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:16,727
Joey was good. Markstrom too.
But this Adebisi character,

454
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:21,027
he's not really focused on the job,
you know.

455
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,913
And he abuses the privilege.

456
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:27,909
Everybody steals,
but he steals too much.

457
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,369
Now, you're a smart guy.

458
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:34,370
And you've been very efficient
doing the jobs l've asked you to do.

459
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,255
So l'm putting you in charge
of the whole cafeteria.

460
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,426
What are you talking?
l run this kitchen.

461
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,509
And you're doing a half-assed job.

462
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:48,308
l got rotten fruit. l got cold entrees.

463
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:51,812
l got Glynn complaining
about cost overages.

464
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:54,482
- l'm not working with him.
- Fine.

465
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:57,228
How about l have you transferred
to the sweatshop?

466
00:32:57,404 --> 00:33:00,405
- l don't like the sweatshop.
- Then shut the fuck up.

467
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,158
Okay?

468
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:05,327
lt's all yours.

469
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,326
All right, ladies, back to work.

470
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:16,412
What?

471
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,095
- We had a deal. We were partners.
- We still are.

472
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:23,591
When it comes to running tits,

473
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:26,433
that part of the operation,
l got no complaints with.

474
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:30,225
But the kitchen,
l can't afford you fucking up.

475
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:32,763
O'Reily will do a good job.

476
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:36,443
Fuck that pretty little mick.

477
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:42,188
Hey, Adebisi, you make your peace
with this any way you can.

478
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:46,571
l say O'Reily's gonna run the kitchen
as good as Dino ever did.

479
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:48,827
You wanna bet on that?

480
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:09,844
What the fuck is going on here,
Wangler?

481
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,848
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Pick up the goddamn pace.

482
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:15,264
We're going as fast as we can, man.

483
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:17,065
All right, everybody quiet down.

484
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:20,021
- You're not fooling me.
- What are you talking about, boss?

485
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:23,730
Yeah, right. Adebisi, listen to me,

486
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:26,655
l know why Schibetta
put me in charge over you.

487
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,862
He's doing the old divide
and conquer.

488
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,405
As long as he keeps the two of us
at each other's throats,

489
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,533
- he's got all the power.
- Cocksucker.

490
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:38,084
- What are you doing?
- Let's face it,

491
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,455
the both of us
only got one goal in mind,

492
00:34:40,674 --> 00:34:43,592
and that's to take over
Schibetta's drug trade.

493
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,678
- Together, we can do it.
- Together?

494
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,683
We gotta make him think
that we're enemies.

495
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:53,851
Keep him off guard till we kill him.

496
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:57,606
- We kill them, the mob kills us.
- They won't know.

497
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,601
Not if we put this in his food.

498
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:04,687
Glass.

499
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:07,439
As long as we make it fine,
he won't be able to taste it.

500
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,530
Over time,
the glass will cut his insides up.

501
00:35:10,746 --> 00:35:14,032
- And he'll die slowly.
- Painfully.

502
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,250
You are a sick motherfucker, O'Reily.

503
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:25,218
Coming from you,
that's a compliment.

504
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:29,389
Wangler.

505
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,797
What's up?

506
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:35,559
- Bring me Schibetta's food.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:38,647
And tell everyone
to start working full speed.

508
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,026
Okay.

509
00:35:43,612 --> 00:35:46,566
Everyone, move your asses now.

510
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:51,243
So, Ryan, if you were released
from Oz today, what would you do?

511
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:52,948
- Travel.
- Where?

512
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:54,706
Around.

513
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:58,367
You know, since l got here, l've been
reading brochures and vacation guides.

514
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,583
They're great for when
you're taking a shit

515
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:02,332
or wanking before you go to sleep.

516
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:05,383
While l'm sleeping, l actually dream
about going to these places.

517
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:06,873
Like?

518
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:08,672
Morogoro.

519
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:12,672
Morogoro? That's a jungle, isn't it?

520
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,430
- Yeah. You knew that?
- Yeah.

521
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,388
- Yeah, it's in Africa.
- Yeah.

522
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:21,935
- You wanna go with me?
- Me?

523
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:26,528
Yeah, you and me, you know.

524
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:29,605
l'm twice your age and l'm a nun.

525
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:32,067
Yeah, well,
growing up and going to St. Pat's,

526
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:33,661
l never had a nun like you.

527
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,955
St. Pat's, huh?

528
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,083
- Tough neighbourhood.
- Yeah, yeah.

529
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:45,747
l learned the alphabet the hard way.
DEA, HlV, lOU.

530
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:47,751
l see.

531
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:56,344
You know, Sister,
l got 1 2 years to my parole.

532
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,051
l wanna be alive to make that parole.

533
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:03,221
l'm gonna walk out of here.
l'm gonna survive.

534
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:19,490
Nine of spades.

535
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,253
Trump.

536
00:37:23,462 --> 00:37:27,756
- You okay, Nino?
- Yeah. Yeah, just a little agita.

537
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:32,842
l told you, you're making the red sauce
too spicy.

538
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:36,887
l don't know what the fuck you're
putting in it, but it's too fucking spicy.

539
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:42,306
- Trump.
- Shit.

540
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:45,014
l was addicted to crack.

541
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,066
Then l had my accident.

542
00:37:50,322 --> 00:37:53,407
Lying in the hospital bed,
l went through detox.

543
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:57,363
But that was easy.

544
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:04,081
The doctors had me on morphine,
Demerol, Percodan.

545
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:06,667
l didn't know l was in pain.

546
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,837
l didn't know l was in the hospital,
paralyzed.

547
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,260
Then l came here
and went into counselling.

548
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,885
l take it one day at a time, you know?

549
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,476
But every day, l think about drugs.
About not doing drugs.

550
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:25,521
Every single day, every single hour,
every single minute.

551
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:30,187
Staying straight has become
my obsession. My new addiction.

552
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:37,988
Twelve years for his conviction
in the attempted rape and assault...

553
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:40,487
Oh, shit.
Jackson Vahue got 1 2 years.

554
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:42,457
Yeah, and l hear he's coming to Oz.

555
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:45,288
Judge Anthony Pepitone
levied the maximum sentence

556
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:48,545
saying that Vahue's conviction
should send a signal that no one,

557
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:51,329
especially a famous sports figure,
is above the...

558
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,005
Hey, McManus,
l been waiting to see you, man.

559
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,173
You ought to get wheelchair access
to your office.

560
00:38:58,349 --> 00:38:59,511
Put it in the suggestion box.

561
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:02,388
Hey, l wanna be
Jackson Vahue's sponsor.

562
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:03,682
How come?

563
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:06,517
The man is one of the greatest
B-ball players of all time.

564
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:07,895
l'm one of his biggest fans.

565
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:10,356
What makes you think
l'm bringing him to Emerald City?

566
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,354
Like everybody else,
you're a starfucker.

567
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,610
Oh, right. Nobody could ever
accuse you of being an asskisser.

568
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:18,659
All right,
you're Jackson Vahue's sponsor.

569
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:20,406
- When does he arrive?
- Tomorrow.

570
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,204
- Great.
- You think you can get

571
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,246
the marching band ready by then?

572
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:38,004
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

573
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:44,601
No!

574
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:56,936

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,119

Let's go. This way.

00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:23,887
Right through there.
Come on, come on, come on.

583
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:27,558
Hey, Jackson,
can l get your autograph?

584
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,515
lt's for my kid.

585
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,079
- Yo, what's up, Jackson?
- Jackson.

586
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:52,081
Hey, Jackson, what's up, baby?

587
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:56,585
- He's a ball-handler, too, man.
- He can handle these balls.

588
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:09,136
Nice shot, yo.
Thought l'd find you here.

589
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:11,056
You go ahead
and leave me the fuck alone.

590
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:13,313
l'm just here
to help you get adjusted.

591
00:41:13,526 --> 00:41:15,814
What, adjusted to this shit?

592
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,774
Where you from?
You from the projects?

593
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,857
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, me too.

594
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,527
Spent all your time adjusting, right?

595
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:26,285
Figuring out
how to fucking stay alive, right?

596
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:28,199
Figuring out
why you don't have nothing.

597
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:30,455
What, you got about three ways
you can get out?

598
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:34,617
You can sell some drugs, or sing,
or this shit right here.

599
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:38,211
They all take some talent, man.

600
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,966
l just happened to be lucky.

601
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:47,053
Fucking jump. l could hang,
l could put this ball in the hoop.

602
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:50,227
Oh, l got adjusted.
l got famous, l got rich.

603
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:54,270
l got used to the touring,
the endorsements, the women.

604
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,939
Maybe not the women.
l fucking blew that, boy. l blew that.

605
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:03,983
The one thing l'm good at
don't mean dick in here.

606
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,651
So how the fuck
am l supposed to adjust to that?

607
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,163
Fuck you. l ain't doing this.

608
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,659
- Oh, yes, you are.
- What's the story here?

609
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:16,333
Mr. NBA won't do
his work assignment.

610
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:17,875
lt was explained to you, right?

611
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:20,006
Everybody in Em City
has a job to do.

612
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:23,130
Give me another job, then,
because l'm not doing this one.

613
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:25,504
You don't get to choose.

614
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:29,300
Look, pal, l don't do windows, okay?

615
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:31,974
l don't do windows.

616
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:36,430
Well, now you get to clean that up.

617
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:42,356
George Washington Carver.
He was born to slave parents

618
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:47,151
but he worked his way up
and through lowa State College,

619
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:50,988
becoming a botanist
and an agricultural chemist.

620
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:54,457
Now, he discovered
hundreds of uses for the peanut,

621
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:56,542
the sweet potato, and the soybean.

622
00:42:56,754 --> 00:43:02,175
Now, Mr. Vahue,
are you listening to me?

623
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:05,385
Sure. Soybean.

624
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:08,135
All right,
we'll pick up here next week.

625
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:10,848
Vahue.

626
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:16,642
Now, l know you're a big
hotshot basketball star.

627
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:19,058
lf you don't start paying attention
in the class,

628
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:21,108
you're going on report.

629
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:26,025
- Go ahead, nigger.
- Oh, no, my friend, you're the nigger.

630
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,486
- You got any drugs?
- No.

631
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:35,032
Then what the fuck good are you?

632
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:47,715
Hey, Jackson,
we made this special for you.

633
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:50,049
- Thanks, man.
- No, thank you.

634
00:43:50,224 --> 00:43:52,893
l won 1 0 grand on that Bulls game.

635
00:43:59,525 --> 00:44:01,103
What, you're looking
for an autograph?

636
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:04,480
Oh, no, my brother,
your fame means nothing to me.

637
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:07,739
Except that you are important
to many children

638
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:09,533
and you are a role model.

639
00:44:09,743 --> 00:44:11,866
l didn't ask to be nobody's
fucking role model.

640
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:13,069
Nonetheless, you are.

641
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:15,827
And that carries
an enormous responsibility.

642
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:18,912
Look, man, fuck you, all right?
Go preach that shit to somebody else.

643
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:25,957
All right, my brother, all right.
But we will talk again.

644
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,050
Don't bet on that.

645
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:32,137
Eat me, nigger.

646
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:48,901
Who do you have to fuck
to get high?

647
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:55,408
Come on, son. Come on, son.

648
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:57,989
Let me squeeze them titties,
man, what?

649
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,781
Come on, yo.

650
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,451
l been fiending for this freedom

651
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,456
l been begging for the beat

652
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:07,586
l been jonesing
For the jump over the wall

653
00:45:07,802 --> 00:45:10,506
But all l keep coming back to
ls them titties

654
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:15,798
Round and firm
For the vein burn

655
00:45:16,185 --> 00:45:20,930
l keep bugging over the reasons
For this shit, l yearn

656
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:26,355
Years in this piece got me wanting
The shit that l unlearned

657
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:29,613
Got me wanting to block it out

658
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:34,159
Forget about
Erase it from my think

659
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,448
Come here, brother.

660
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:44,792
No.

661
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:47,374
Boy, you don't wanna get titillated.

662
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:49,551
No.

663
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:52,378
Come here, boy, don't be a pussy.

664
00:45:52,888 --> 00:45:55,842
Man, l been clean almost two years.

665
00:45:56,684 --> 00:46:01,144
Man, this one little hit
ain't gonna kill you. Come on.

666
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:05,022
See, we talking
about the '95 Bulls game.

667
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:07,315
Right. You scored 58 points.

668
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:11,646
That's right. That ain't all l scored.

669
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:15,738
A little three-way
with two cheerleaders.

670
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:19,073
Yeah, you'll always be my hero, man.

671
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,959
That's me. Fucking role model.

672
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:25,376
- Fucking role model.
- Yeah, boy. Come on.

673
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:32,794
Well, maybe just one.

674
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,561
Yeah. Doesn't get harder, right?

675
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:21,382
You know that's been
up Kenny's ass, right?

676
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:23,891
Next is Kareem Said.

677
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:26,856
Dr. Prestopnick diagnosed him
for hypertension

678
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:29,817
prescribed Calan,
but his vital signs have yet to stabilise.

679
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,568
He's not taking his medication.

680
00:47:32,738 --> 00:47:36,154
That doesn't make sense. A guy
like Said has everything to live for.

681
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:38,614
Well, my guess is that
he's concerned about the effect

682
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:41,740
the drug's gonna have on his mind.
He doesn't want his judgment clouded.

683
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:43,664
Well, l can understand that.

684
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,406
Oz is the last place
you want to let your guard down.

685
00:47:47,837 --> 00:47:49,461
Can't you switch his prescription?

686
00:47:49,672 --> 00:47:51,463
Yeah, but they all have side effects.

687
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:53,541
lf we don't get him
to take something, and soon,

688
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:57,051
it's only a matter of time
before his blood pressure explodes.

689
00:48:00,182 --> 00:48:02,720
Don't think of me as a psychologist.

690
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:06,719
Don't think of me as a nun.
Think of me as your mother.

691
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:10,355
Kareem, take your medicine.

692
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:14,354
Now, Sister, l thought l was in here
for psychiatric evaluation.

693
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:16,695
You are. Because when you play
fast and loose

694
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:18,739
with high blood pressure,
you are crazy.

695
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:21,524
Oh, Sister, l'm far from crazy.

696
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:25,488
You see, God endowed me
with a mind, a free will

697
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,199
and gave me the ability to choose.

698
00:48:28,377 --> 00:48:30,037
l choose to be drug-free.

699
00:48:30,254 --> 00:48:33,955
And you make the choice how?
By considering the facts.

700
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,466
The fact is, you will die.

701
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:41,806
My physical condition
is a small part of a greater reality.

702
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:44,681
Now, it's been hard.

703
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:48,479
But l am now
at peace with this, Sister.

704
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:50,809
Now, why can't you be?

705
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,020
You...

706
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:59,229
Asalaam alaikum, Sister.
You're a good woman.

707
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:00,696
Yeah.

708
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,165
Okay, Huseni Mershah,

709
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,073
this is Kareem Said.

710
00:49:10,294 --> 00:49:13,912
Kareem's gonna help you get used to
the routine in Emerald City.

711
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:16,088
Asalaam alaikum, brother.

712
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:25,553
Here, your cuffs.

713
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:31,518
Asalaam alaikum, huh?

714
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:34,735
Yeah. Have a nice day.

715
00:49:42,034 --> 00:49:47,788
Prisoner number 9 7 M688,
Huseni Mershah.

716
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:51,414
Also known as
James Monroe Madison.

717
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:57,582
Convicted August 1 1, '9 7.

718
00:49:58,384 --> 00:50:00,542
Attempted murder,

719
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,555
assault in the first degree.

720
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,254
Stop.

721
00:50:05,432 --> 00:50:11,269
Sentence: 20 years.
Up for parole in three.

722
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:16,481
The Jew shot Omar Selim
because he figured Selim

723
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:20,103
was gonna rip off his little store. Selim
didn't even have a weapon on him.

724
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:22,813
- And the Jew got off.
- Oh, you know it.

725
00:50:22,992 --> 00:50:25,946
So we had to teach the Jew
a little lesson on respect.

726
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:30,740
Thank you, Brother Huseni.
But now we pray.

727
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,957
lmam Said, listen,

728
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:40,666
l think we gotta do
a little more than pray.

729
00:50:40,843 --> 00:50:44,923
We will, brother. Believe me, we will.

730
00:50:45,806 --> 00:50:49,674
''Believers are like a single man.

731
00:50:49,852 --> 00:50:55,191
lf his eye is affected,
then all of him is affected.

732
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:58,769
lf the head is affected,

733
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:04,021
- then all of him is affected.''
- Hey, wanna shut the fuck up? Yo.

734
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,608
- Got a problem?
- Your bullshit's making me sick.

735
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,360
Don't insult the holy word.

736
00:51:10,706 --> 00:51:11,785
Suck my dick, asshole.

737
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:24,752
- What's the problem here, guys?
- There ain't no problem, officer.

738
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,594
Sit down.

739
00:51:43,906 --> 00:51:45,151
l'm sorry if we disturbed you.

740
00:51:47,576 --> 00:51:50,246
- Fuck you.
- Make nice, Ross.

741
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:53,289
lf you can't handle that, take a walk.

742
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,162
- Fuck you too.
- Okay.

743
00:52:01,423 --> 00:52:03,630
Everybody sit down.

744
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,217
He was making fun
of the word of God, Minister.

745
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:11,095
God does not need you
to defend him from a moron.

746
00:52:12,017 --> 00:52:15,766
What God needs you to do
is to rein in your basic instincts.

747
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:19,225
What God needs you to do
is just to be a little patient, brother.

748
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:22,902
The more little skirmishes
you get us involved in...

749
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:28,275
...is the more you weaken
the holy war we about to fight.

750
00:52:29,785 --> 00:52:32,110
- So where you from, Minister?
- From?

751
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:35,330
Yeah, where you from?
You're not from the ghetto, right?

752
00:52:38,377 --> 00:52:43,335
l was born in the ghetto.
But unlike most, l got out.

753
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:48,419
l have travelled the world, Huseni,
studied the great religions.

754
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:52,463
And l have sat at the knee
of mystics, shaman and madmen.

755
00:52:53,017 --> 00:52:55,472
l know the world, Huseni.

756
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:58,521
Maybe you been on the mountaintop
so long, you forgot where you're from.

757
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:02,597
l have not forgotten who l am.

758
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:08,358
Well, maybe Allah sent me
to remind you.

759
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:25,414
Hey, lmam Said's moving slow, man.
lt worries me.

760
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:27,921
He knows best, brother.

761
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:30,294
Yeah, well,
he's blessed by Allah and all that,

762
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:32,713
but that don't mean
he can't be wrong.

763
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,170
So?

764
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:40,678
So l'm thinking, you know,
he might be more valuable to us

765
00:53:40,856 --> 00:53:43,774
as a symbol rather than as a leader.

766
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:47,104
A symbol? What do you mean?

767
00:53:49,824 --> 00:53:54,035
Nothing, man, nothing.
l'm just talking smack.

768
00:53:54,662 --> 00:53:57,532
l'm just wasting time.

769
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:12,718
Huseni.

770
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:15,427
What, what, what? What, what?

771
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,559
lmam, what?

772
00:54:19,478 --> 00:54:21,934
- My heart.
- You're having a heart attack.

773
00:54:22,148 --> 00:54:23,772
Call the doctor.

774
00:54:23,983 --> 00:54:27,434
lt is the hand of God.
lt is the will of Allah.

775
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:32,696
Help me, help-- Help me.

776
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,192
You must go ahead and die.

777
00:54:48,382 --> 00:54:53,377
All those little aches and pains,
eventually, they add up to something.

778
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:57,263
Body, mind. Body, mind.

779
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,924
They gotta work together
or they don't work at all.

780
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,269
You gotta take care of your body.

781
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,101
You gotta take care of your mind.

782
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:08,852
You gotta love your body.

783
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:13,150
Most people don't.
Most people hate their bodies.

784
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:16,028
You gotta get your mind
to love your body.

785
00:55:16,243 --> 00:55:17,737
Even if you're fat around the neck,

786
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:20,195
or even if things don't work
like they're supposed to,

787
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:23,290
you gotta love your body.

788
00:55:23,918 --> 00:55:28,544
Because it's all you got to hold on to.
lt's all you got.

789
00:55:28,756 --> 00:55:30,001
l'll make a deal with you.

790
00:55:30,382 --> 00:55:33,834
l'll love your body if you love mine.
