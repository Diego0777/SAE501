1
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:40,037
Back in the 1950s,
there was a game show on TV

2
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,048
called, ''You Bet Your Life,''

3
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,050
hosted by Groucho Marx.

4
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,279
Every week, Groucho
would ask inane questions

5
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,184
and insult the
contestants.

6
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,883
A fake duck would
drop down on a string,

7
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,414
and Groucho would go,

8
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,324
''Say the secret word
and win $100.''

9
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,956
But not once did anyone
ever actually bet their life,

10
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,966
unlike in Oz.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,902
No one ever put
their life on the line.

12
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,997
The attempted assassination
of Governor James Devlin

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,702
by a former employee
of the Oswald Correctional Facility

14
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,143
has sent a shock wave
through this election campaign

15
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:14,147
and the entire state.

16
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:16,046
Devlin, who is listed
in stable condition,

17
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,516
announced that he intends
to stay in the race for re-election.

18
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,782
The suspect,
Clayton Hughes,

19
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,813
is being held without bail
at the Crown and Shield Holding Center.

20
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,582
Clayton! Clayton!...

21
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:38,001
Kill Hughes! Kill Hughes!...

22
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,373
- Sean.
- Lockdown?

23
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:51,646
Lockdown! Let's go!
Move your asses now!

24
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:55,385
Come on, get inside!
Come on, let's go!

25
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:00,485
Get in your cell.
Now!

26
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,335
Clayton Hughes
is a close friend of our family's,

27
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:14,704
and though l find his actions
utterly reprehensible,

28
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,403
l feel compelled,

29
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:19,708
out of loyalty to his mother
and late father,

30
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:22,715
to stand by Clayton's side
at his hour of need.

31
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,614
l am therefore
withdrawing my name

32
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:27,779
as a candidate for the nomination
of Lieutenant Governor.

33
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,085
That is all.

34
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,198
The niggers playing again.

35
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,564
You two fucks ain't
selling enough tits.

36
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,569
The fuck you mean
we ain't sellin' enough tits?

37
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,230
- You buggin'.
- Who sells more than us?

38
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,332
Desmond Mobay.

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,275
Man, fuck
that Jamaican fuck.

40
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,905
Fuck you, nigger.
Now my fuckers get pumping.

41
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,606
Let's do this.

42
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,755
Hey, Mobay.

43
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,720
You gotta stop making us
look so bad, man.

44
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,626
You dig
what l'm saying?

45
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:11,494
l do what l'm told.

46
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,726
Well, we's telling you
something different.

47
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,110
l am not afraid of you.

48
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,507
Or you.

49
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,975
Hey, hey!
Back! Back!

50
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:37,055
You have gotta learn
to control your emotions.

51
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,921
- Follow Officer Keating here.
- You sending me to the hole?

52
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:44,522
Not this time. Detective McGorry
wants to interview you.

53
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,361
l don't know no McGorry.
Who the fuck is that?

54
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,095
Homicide cop investigating
the Bruno Gergan murder.

55
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,103
l don't know nothing
about Bruno Gergan,

56
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,105
- all right?
- Tell it to her.

57
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,629
Punk ass.

58
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:06,318
According to the files,
you and Leroy Tidd

59
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,321
had a little altercation

60
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,152
with Bruno Gergan
in the gym.

61
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,249
- An alter-what?
- A fight.

62
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,625
Oh. We was just
fucking around.

63
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:16,993
You beat him
to a pulp.

64
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,469
Yeah, well,

65
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:25,130
sometimes we get
carried away.

66
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,570
He lived, though.

67
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,335
Not for long.

68
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,144
Look, l didn't push Gergan
down no elevator shaft.

69
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:35,409
lf you didn't,
who did?

70
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:38,975
The only one l know
grieving Gergan was Mobay.

71
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:42,477
- Desmond Mobay?
- Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,685
The two of them had
some weirdness going on between them.

73
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,324
l'm here.

74
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,301
Sit down.

75
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:07,439
Found out some
very disturbing news today.

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,142
Yeah?
What's that?

77
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,048
There's an undercover narc
in Oz.

78
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,320
Shit.

79
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,586
His name is Brand,
Cecil Brand.

80
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,752
He's over
in Unit B.

81
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,591
And he's one
of your customers.

82
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,030
- What do we do?
- Whack... his... ass.

83
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,432
- Who?
- You.

84
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,529
l want you to kill
that fucking cop.

85
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,064
No problem.

86
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,511
Go.

87
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,724
You know,
for a minute,

88
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,920
l thought
you was undercover.

89
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,656
l mean-- but you can't be,
you know,

90
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,666
given the amount
of shit you were snorting,

91
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,669
given the amount of
shit you been selling.

92
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,830
lt's crazy, l know.

93
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,170
But that night you were
so cranked up on tits

94
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,608
that your accent
suddenly disappeared...

95
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:13,407
l was, like,
what the fuck is that?

96
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,505
And then your girlfriend--
what's her name?

97
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,413
Kina?

98
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,647
l was positive that l
recognized her from somewhere.

99
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,212
Tore my brain out
trying to remember--

100
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,656
trying to remember where.
Then l had a flash.

101
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:28,126
No! No!

102
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,095
When they threw me
off the roof,

103
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,730
l was laying
on the cold pavement,

104
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,997
and this woman police

105
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,973
came over to see
if l was still alive.

106
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,943
That woman police...

107
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,349
she's a dead
ringer for your Kina.

108
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,020
Lights out!

109
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:02,124
Well, good night, Mobay.

110
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,791
Or Officer Whoever-the-fuck-
you-are.

111
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,124
Hey!

112
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,535
You talk that shit
to anyone,

113
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,506
you're next down
the elevator shaft.

114
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,169
All right,
break it up in there.

115
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,142
l'm telling
nobody nothing.

116
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,148
l'm telling nobody
that you're a cop,

117
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,486
a cop who breaks the law
all in the name of the law.

118
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,616
l just want you to know

119
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,685
that l know you're a fraud.

120
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:38,595
And l don't mean
that you're undercover.

121
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,826
l mean as a person.

122
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,459
You're a fraud.

123
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,793
He's still alive.
Get a doctor up here!

124
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:19,130
- l murdered Bruno Gergan.
- What?

125
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,565
l committed a crime.
l should be punished.

126
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,202
Why are you confessing?

127
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,975
Because l took
an oath.

128
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:32,883
Because l'm not a fraud.

129
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,683
Because l don't want
to be one of them.

130
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,996
The arrest
of Detective Basil

131
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,971
for the murder
of Bruno Gergan

132
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,100
has obviously put an end
to the undercover narcotics operation,

133
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,110
at least for the time being.

134
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:01,443
With all due respect, Warden, l think
you're gonna have to accept the fact

135
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,506
that the war on drugs
is unwinnable.

136
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,346
You know,
that's not true.

137
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:08,354
We have to be diligent.
We have to keep fighting.

138
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:11,448
We can't just give up on education.
We have to rehabilitate.

139
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,119
l'm not saying you're not gonna get
lucky with a slug or two,

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,027
but if you think
you're gonna eradicate heroin from Oz,

141
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:18,792
well, that's just
plain stupid.

142
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,799
Who you calling stupid?

143
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,597
- Hey, if the shoe fits...
- Fuck you!

144
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:25,103
- All right, enough!
- Pussy!

145
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:28,107
- Come on!
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

146
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,503
What the fuck
is happening here?

147
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,035
Pete!

148
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,310
l am sick to death
of sitting in on these meetings

149
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:39,807
and listening to you
people with your petty little egos.

150
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,548
The walls are crumbling
down around us,

151
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,351
and all you
care about is yourselves.

152
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,381
Well--

153
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,425
Go after her.

154
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,173
Pete?

155
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,504
No.

156
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,543
Shh, l wanna talk.

157
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,104
No, no.
l'll be fine, Ray.

158
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,116
No, really,

159
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,050
l'll be fine.

160
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,595
- l don't get cravings anymore.
- That's horseshit.

161
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,590
- What are you doing here?
- l'm an addict.

162
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:31,660
l'm getting yearnings.
l may start again. l need your help.

163
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,730
l don't want
you in this room.

164
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:40,679
Sister,

165
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,704
you can't refuse me.

166
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,717
Oh, yes.

167
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,719
Yes, l can.

168
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:49,051
Take him back, please.

169
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,366
So, Augustus,

170
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,698
you were about to make
some point?

171
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,862
Oh, yeah.

172
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,709
- Hi!
- Hi.

173
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,239
l was gonna come up
to the office and see you,

174
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:17,909
but l thought... no.

175
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,918
Listen, l'm surprised
you got this far.

176
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,510
How you doing?

177
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,284
Small increments
are better, you know?

178
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,950
- Yeah.
- You?

179
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,052
Ahh, l'm in a mood.

180
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,859
Today l got
the documents to sign.

181
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,390
- Documents?
- To stop being a nun.

182
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:37,062
So this lunch
we're having

183
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,968
is a celebration?

184
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,269
l don't know.

185
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,832
l still haven't
made up my mind.

186
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,867
When you join
a religious order, you know,

187
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,972
you become
a bride of Christ.

188
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:51,040
lt's hard to accept

189
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:54,053
that when l put my signature
on those documents

190
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,080
Christ and l
are divorced.

191
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,395
Oh, fuck me,
you piece of shit.

192
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:23,179
Oh, fuck!

193
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:38,092
Okay, what's
the matter now, Cyril?

194
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:40,427
You and that woman.

195
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,263
- What woman?
- Officer Howell.

196
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,768
What about her?

197
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,431
You and she are bad.

198
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:47,564
Huh?

199
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,599
- Come on, tell.
- Tell? What?

200
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,611
There's nothing to tell.

201
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,613
Wink, wink.

202
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:55,978
l'm gonna tell.

203
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,744
- Shut up, Cyril.
- Fuck you.

204
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:01,344
- You shut up or l'll--
- What? You're going to what?

205
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,378
l can take you.

206
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,449
l can beat you up.

207
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:13,097
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

208
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,123
This fucking place!

209
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,760
Here it is.

210
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,333
l sign that document,

211
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,700
l stop being a nun.

212
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:26,268
You gonna sign it?

213
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,942
Yes.
Wanna watch?

214
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,777
No, thanks.

215
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,756
Sister, hey.

216
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,024
- l really need to talk to you.
- l was just leaving.

217
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,293
No, Father.
Please stay.

218
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,697
l'd appreciate
your input.

219
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,464
- What's up?
- lt's my brother.

220
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:54,496
He seems to be okay
after the OD,

221
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,742
but he's having these
terrible nightmares again.

222
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,406
So he only gets
but a few hours of sleep,

223
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,415
and l'm beginning
to think that the--

224
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,882
the-- what'd you
call it?

225
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,886
- Deprivation?
- Yeah, that.

226
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,115
That shit's just starting
to affect his brain.

227
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,386
Why? What's he doing?

228
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,655
He's becoming aggressive.

229
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,662
He's making things up

230
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,826
and claiming to see things
that just aren't there.

231
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,629
- Really?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,796
l was wondering if maybe

233
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,602
you could put him back
on some kind of medication,

234
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,269
you know, something
to knock him out.

235
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,302
Just for a little while
until he gets some sleep?

236
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,707
All right,
l'll meet with Cyril,

237
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,344
- then l'll decide what's best for him.
- Okay.

238
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,184
You gotta remember this:

239
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,747
this stuff he's saying,

240
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,591
man, it's crazy.

241
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,393
And the nightmares
are always the same?

242
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,696
Pretty much.

243
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,702
ls there anything
in your dreams

244
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:58,499
that you see
when you're awake?

245
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:00,494
No.

246
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,533
Cyril, do you remember
anything before your accident?

247
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,637
Before l got hit
in the head?

248
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,908
Yeah.

249
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:11,712
My mother's hands.

250
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,978
They were rough,

251
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,854
all red from working,

252
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:22,456
but soft
when she touched me.

253
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,053
Anything else?

254
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,658
The cross...

255
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,862
like that...

256
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,331
around her neck.

257
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,704
She'd pray to Jesus.

258
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,310
Do you believe
in Jesus?

259
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,273
That's a silly question.

260
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:45,307
Why?

261
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,487
'Cause it's not
up to me,

262
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,887
believing
or not believing.

263
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:55,050
We don't choose God.

264
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,520
God chooses us.

265
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,831
Cyril, do you mind
if l talk to your brother for a minute?

266
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,863
Sure.

267
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:12,909
So?

268
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,880
l don't see any
of the symptoms you described.

269
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,883
ln fact,
quite the opposite.

270
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,385
He's always on his best behavior
with you, Sister,

271
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,683
- but l swear to God, the kid's--
- Ryan, don't swear.

272
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:25,316
What is true
is that he's exhausted,

273
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,087
so we need to try
to find a medication

274
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:28,991
other than the Haldol
to help him sleep.

275
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,518
Good, thank you.

276
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:33,293
l'll have Dr. Prestopnik
write up a prescription.

277
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,400
- Hello, Chris.
- Sister.

278
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,436
Stay where you are.

279
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,812
As you know,
for the past month or so,

280
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,587
l've been preparing
to leave the convent.

281
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,184
Mm-hmm.

282
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,423
Part of that stems

283
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:07,261
from the conversations
we had together.

284
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,666
You made me doubt myself
as a psychologist,

285
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,195
as a nun,
as a woman.

286
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,403
l'm sorry if l
caused you grief.

287
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,536
Oh, you caused me grief,

288
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:22,945
and l wanna
thank you for it.

289
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,916
What?

290
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,387
You know, Chris,

291
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,389
most of us

292
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:33,392
tumble into our lives.

293
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,759
We become who we are
almost by accident.

294
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,627
We try very hard
not to look backwards,

295
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,636
afraid to find out

296
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,366
that maybe we should've
done something else.

297
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,931
But you forced me
to look backwards,

298
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,943
to question

299
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:55,504
every element
of my identity.

300
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,311
By questioning,
do you know--

301
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,544
do you know
what l discovered?

302
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,576
l am a psychologist.

303
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,282
l am a woman.

304
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,484
l am a nun.

305
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,093
And all of these parts
of me are not an accident.

306
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,190
They were put together
by someone else.

307
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:17,827
Someone far greater.

308
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:21,896
We do not choose God.

309
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,569
God chooses us.

310
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:30,142
What happens to those of us
who he don't choose?

311
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,150
Like in grade school,

312
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:34,277
you're waiting
for one side or the other

313
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,983
to pick you
to play kickball,

314
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,852
but you're too small,

315
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,952
you're too stupid,

316
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,486
or maybe you're just
too weird.

317
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,667
All bullshit aside,
Sister,

318
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:52,102
l want God
to pick me.

319
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:54,435
Pick me!

320
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,045
Maybe he will.

321
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,605
There's still time.

322
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:08,379
You know something,
Sister?

323
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,411
l don't think so.

324
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:33,643
Oh, fuck!

325
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,583
We gotta stop.

326
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:39,675
What?

327
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,686
This.

328
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,348
- Why?
- People are talking.

329
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,756
- Fuck 'em.
- You'll as get fired.

330
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,419
What is this, O'Reily?

331
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,826
l'm sucking your dick so much
you're losing your balls?

332
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,331
- No, but l just thought that maybe--
- This ain't over

333
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:55,094
till l say it's over.

334
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:58,297
You start thinking different,
l'll crush these balls of yours.

335
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,396
You got that, punk?

336
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,574
Good.

337
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:07,409
Same time tomorrow,
cunnilingus.

338
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,379
Let's go.

339
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:14,886
There's nothing like
the thrill of gambling.

340
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,583
Nothing compares to that incredible
feeling of anticipation.

341
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:22,025
You wait breathlessly
for the roll of the dice,

342
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,155
for the spin of the wheel,
for the flip of the card.

343
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:29,099
You wait to see what fortune
fate will hand you.

344
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,373
Bob! Bob,
you're alive!

345
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,342
Apparently so.

346
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:40,811
Busmalis, get to work.

347
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,809
What did the doctor say?

348
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:50,344
Did the surgery go well?
Was the tumor benign?

349
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:53,722
- Yes, l'll survive, only...
- What?

350
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:58,021
l have this terrible scar
on my head.

351
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,190
They tell me
in time it'll go away,

352
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:02,530
but even so, l'm embarrassed
to be seen like this.

353
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,229
Bob, you're
so vain.

354
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,566
Don't get insulting.

355
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,868
No, vain is good.

356
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:10,374
When you got out of the hole,
you were kinda dragging.

357
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,104
But vain means
you still feel alive.

358
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,771
Stop talking nonsense.

359
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,939
Scar's hardly noticeable.

360
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,573
Bullshit!

361
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,953
This is your
lucky hat.

362
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,960
l'm lucky.

363
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,155
l'm glad you're
still breathing.

364
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:41,306
Miss Sally is really
coming to Oz?

365
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,070
When she heard after my escape,
that l went to her house,

366
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:46,202
that l'm her
number-one fan,

367
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,440
my goddess decided
she wanted to meet me.

368
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,345
Miss Sally in Oz.

369
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,373
Next we'll have
Seinfeld in here.

370
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,579
- How do l look?
- Truth?

371
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:57,953
- No, lie.
- You're very handsome.

372
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,480
Thank you.

373
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:04,121
- So where'd you get the flowers?
- That's a secret.

374
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:07,189
- Wish me luck.
- You're gonna need more than luck.

375
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,268
- Miss Sally?
- Yes.

376
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,066
How do you do?

377
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,973
These are for you.

378
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:18,875
Thank you.
They're lovely.

379
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,971
lt is a great thrill
to meet you, Miss Sally.

380
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:26,416
When l got word that you were dropping
by, it knocked me for a loop.

381
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,387
l am the envy
of every cell block.

382
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,913
That's very sweet.
l brought you something.

383
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,621
Oh my God.

384
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:38,027
There are guys in here
that would kill for this,

385
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,724
literally.

386
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:43,902
Miss Sally, l gotta
tell you,

387
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:46,837
you don't laugh
like you do on TV.

388
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:50,239
And while we're
on the subject,

389
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:52,903
you don't look the same
as on TV.

390
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:55,106
You seem smaller.

391
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,115
The camera adds
10 lbs.

392
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,548
To your breasts?

393
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,381
Fuck.

394
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,683
Miss Sally, you swore.

395
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:05,121
What about yesterday's lesson,
watch your tongue?

396
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:07,284
l'm not Miss Sally.

397
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,294
l work as a secretary
at the station.

398
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:11,762
l'm in charge of answering
all the letters

399
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:13,765
that Miss Sally receives.

400
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,030
When l heard about you escaping,
l remembered getting your letters.

401
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,934
l thought they were so sweet.

402
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:21,462
l went to Miss Sally
and asked her to visit here.

403
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:24,032
- And she said no?
- She got angry.

404
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,340
- She threw Neuter at me.
- Oh.

405
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,812
So l thought, hell,
l look enough like the bitch,

406
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,815
maybe l'll pull it off.

407
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,407
But l failed.

408
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,284
No, no,
this means a lot,

409
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,187
that you read my letters,
that you wanted to come.

410
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:40,691
- What's your name?
- Norma Clark.

411
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,159
Thank you, Norma.

412
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,958
You're welcome,
Agamemnon.

413
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:48,160
And if you don't mind,
l'd like to keep writing.

414
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,633
Of course.

415
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,262
But this time,
l'll write to you.

416
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:54,637
That'd be swell.

417
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:58,800
Everybody gambles,

418
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,675
from a card-shark
in Atlantic City

419
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:03,146
to an old lady scratching
at a lottery ticket.

420
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:05,150
Taking a chance,
risking it all,

421
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,584
that's as basic
a human need as

422
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,314
food, clothing, shelter.

423
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:13,120
lt's as fundamental to our genetic
makeup as killing thy neighbor.

424
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,459
Deyell, what the fuck
are you doing over there?

425
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,929
l'm digging an escape hatch.

426
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:25,701
Dumb-ass negro.

427
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:28,035
Fucking come sack.

428
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,174
- Miles.
- No. No, no!

429
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:40,515
No, no!

430
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:43,385
- Miles.
- No, no, no.

431
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:45,856
Your execution is set
for two weeks from Thursday.

432
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,485
Now there are certain matters
we have to discuss.

433
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:50,825
- No, no, no!
- The most important being

434
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:54,526
- how you're gonna die.
- No, no, no!

435
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,299
lf you don't make up your mind soon,
l'll be forced to decide for you.

436
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,307
No! No! No!

437
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:04,332
No! No! No!

438
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,367
Take him down to psych.

439
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,946
Get up, Rembrandt.
Give me a--

440
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,578
Slam his ass!

441
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:32,963
Wait a minute.

442
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,337
l can't talk to him
all chained up like this.

443
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:38,036
Believe me, Sister,
you don't want him running loose.

444
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,709
All right.
Wait outside.

445
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,408
No way.

446
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,844
Wait outside.

447
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:51,287
Come in.

448
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:57,956
Mark,

449
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:01,397
the warden thought it would be a good
idea for us to get together.

450
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:04,493
He says you're--
you're having problems

451
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,697
accepting the fact
that the date of your

452
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,508
execution
is approaching.

453
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,874
Problems?

454
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,902
l'm scared
shitless.

455
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:17,507
l seen Shirley Bellinger go

456
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,040
and that fag Ginsburg
die right there in the cell.

457
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,044
lt gets you thinking.

458
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,417
Look,

459
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,586
l am not a fan
of capital punishment,

460
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:31,823
and there are a lot
of others like me

461
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:34,423
who are doing
everything they can to stop it,

462
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,669
But that's
not going to happen

463
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:39,330
before two weeks
from Thursday.

464
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:41,464
Oh, Christ.

465
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,535
Mark,

466
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:47,602
you made a choice
to murder your family,

467
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:49,807
and as a result,

468
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:52,976
you don't have a choice
about staying alive.

469
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:55,009
So what you need,

470
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:57,613
and what l want
to help you do,

471
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:00,523
is to...

472
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,652
prepare for the end.

473
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,562
l know what you're
going through, man.

474
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:15,471
Sometimes the reality of what's gonna
happen fucks me up, too.

475
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,771
l don't need your
fucking sympathy, Sambo.

476
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,176
You don't quit,
do you?

477
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,681
l'm trying to work here,
so shut your fucking jive-ass mouth.

478
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:28,710
?? Amazing grace ??

479
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,312
Shut up.

480
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:34,189
?? How sweet the sound ??

481
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:36,524
l said shut up,
you fucking black bastard!

482
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:55,572
Holy shit!

483
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,278
Yo, Lopresti.

484
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:30,406
Can l get that mirror?
lt was Shirley's.

485
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,876
Oh, gee.

486
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:38,685
Seven years' bad luck.

487
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:41,954
Lights out!

488
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:10,017
- Fuck!
- Step aside, Vern.

489
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,421
Let a real man
at the table.

490
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,484
- Schillinjer.
- Schillinger.

491
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:17,995
Whatever.
You got a visitor.

492
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:20,327
Well, l'm not
expecting anyone.

493
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,060
She says she's
your daughter-in-law.

494
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,728
My what?

495
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:35,435
Mr. Schillinger?

496
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,640
Yeah?

497
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,407
l'm Carrie.

498
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,750
Hank's wife.

499
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:46,279
Look, honey, l don't know what kind
of scam you're trying to pull--

500
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:48,258
He didn't tell you
he was married?

501
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,817
No.

502
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,394
Oh, God.

503
00:30:58,436 --> 00:30:59,903
Are you okay?

504
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,498
She's fine.
Mind your own fucking business.

505
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:05,703
l'm sorry.

506
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:07,837
l'm just so afraid.

507
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,007
Hank and me met,
and we had sex right off

508
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:13,244
and started hanging out
all the time together.

509
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,253
And then a few weeks ago,

510
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,380
he came into some money
all of a sudden

511
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,390
and says,
''Let's get hitched.''

512
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,756
So l say, ''Okay.''

513
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,784
But now he's gone.

514
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,989
He's disappeared
off the planet

515
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,999
and l don't know
what l'm gonna do.

516
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,763
You got any kind of proof
you two are married?

517
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,664
Our wedding certificate.

518
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:48,085
We done it at City Hall.

519
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,110
Why the fuck
didn't he tell me?

520
00:31:50,155 --> 00:31:53,386
Oh, that's Hank.
Mr. Secretive.

521
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,652
l know where he is.

522
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,790
He went to Miami.
l gave him money for the trip.

523
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,925
Miami?
When is he due back?

524
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,562
- l don't know.
- Sooner than later?

525
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:07,572
'Cause it's
gotta be sooner.

526
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:09,301
See...

527
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,309
l got a...
situation.

528
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,311
l need his help.

529
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:16,746
What kind of situation?
Maybe l can help.

530
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,846
l'm pregnant.

531
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:29,018
- What the fuck is this, man?
- l ain't tryin' to hear you.

532
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,961
- What the fuck is you saying?
- l'm saying get up off my face.

533
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:33,726
Trust me,

534
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,960
l don't want to be peeping
your ugly fucking mug

535
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:38,265
any more
than l have to, okay?

536
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,396
Hey, what's the problem?

537
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:42,929
- This fucking child won't be talked to.
- Nigger, fuck you.

538
00:32:42,974 --> 00:32:44,464
Mondo, here--

539
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,067
l ain't one
of your dogs, man.

540
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:48,238
l ain't one
of your prags either.

541
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,875
What l am is sick and tired
of all your bullshit.

542
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:57,446
Kids today...

543
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,457
We gotta do something
to shut his ass down.

544
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,459
Yeah, relax, relax.
Listen,

545
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:03,484
got some ideas l want to
talk to you about.

546
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,268
Ah, trouble
in paradise.

547
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,270
Yeah, but not enough
to be of any use to us.

548
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:14,329
You know what we got here,
O'Reily?

549
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:16,840
A fandango,

550
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,843
and we gotta
do something about it.

551
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:21,869
Hey, l don't like being in the minority,
but what can we do?

552
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:24,905
Even these fucking Muslims
are kowtowing to Adebisi.

553
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:28,510
Well, we could detonate

554
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,521
a few well placed
depth charges.

555
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,989
Whatever you need, K-Boy.

556
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,108
My God. Oh my God!

557
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,306
Help! Help!
Help, murder!

558
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:00,307
Murder! Murder!

559
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:05,686
Murder!

560
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:16,725
Like my day wasn't
already in the toilet.

561
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,035
Do you know what we've got
down there?

562
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,309
A dead fucking body.
Do you know what that means?

563
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:32,316
My record of no violence
is kaput.

564
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,817
You know what that means?

565
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:36,013
You are up to your
African ass in shit.

566
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:37,954
This is not my fault.

567
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,457
Oh yes it is.
We had a deal.

568
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:43,154
l would let you do
whatever the fuck you wanted

569
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,185
as long as you kept
the horseshit to zero.

570
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,255
A corpse is not zero.

571
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,198
So what do you
want me to do?

572
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:53,170
l want you to find me the bastard
that did this and bring me his ass,

573
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:56,298
- alive.
- You want me to play cop?

574
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,775
Life sucks all around.

575
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:13,290
Anything?

576
00:35:13,324 --> 00:35:16,589
The dead guy, Shemin,
he was a complete fucking loser.

577
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:19,529
He ain't had no friends,
and as far as we know,

578
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,759
- he ain't had no enemies.
- Found out one thing,

579
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,064
- him and Tobias Beecher fucked.
- Yup.

580
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:25,467
- Beecher?
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:27,061
Bring him to me.

582
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,501
l didn't kill Shemin.

583
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,407
l heard about you
fucked him, though.

584
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:35,379
Once. He was lousy.

585
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:42,944
So were you, Mondo.

586
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:10,573
- What the fuck are you doing?
- l'm looking for the murder weapon.

587
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:13,413
Adebisi says that if l don't
find out who killed Shemin,

588
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,180
they're gonna beat
the shit out of me.

589
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,778
Get the fuck
off my stuff, man.

590
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:19,381
l saw you go
into the laundry room

591
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:22,291
with Shemin.
l saw you come out alone.

592
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,318
That don't mean dick.

593
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:27,092
Why did you do it?
Why did you kill him?

594
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:32,870
See this tat?

595
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:36,772
l got it the night
of my second marriage in Vegas.

596
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:40,073
l'd just run
this great Ponzi on some elderly couple,

597
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,545
so you know,
l'm celebrating--

598
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,844
some single malt,
a little X

599
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,851
and a whole lot
of Bonnie.

600
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:49,285
And as we fucked,

601
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,778
l kept yelling, ''l'm a God.
l'm a fucking God.''

602
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,792
l'm fucking tripping
out of my mind.

603
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,521
l go to this all-night
tattoo parlor

604
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:59,086
because l wanted every slob
on the strip to know

605
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,499
l was Almighty.

606
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:05,730
But l'm not.

607
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,295
See, l know that now,
Beecher, but this tattoo,

608
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,308
it ain't going away,
not without a lot more blood.

609
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:14,505
And l am supposed to glean
what from that story?

610
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,776
Well...

611
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,647
l see you fucking all
these other guys.

612
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,280
You said you didn't care
who l fucked.

613
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:26,347
l do.
l do, okay?

614
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,689
And you killed Shemin

615
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,024
'cause he and l fucked?

616
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,121
No, l--

617
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:42,964
- l'm gonna tell Adebisi what l know.
- Oh, l don't think you will.

618
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:45,475
- Why not?
- Well, for two reasons.

619
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,478
One, l know
you hired Pancamo

620
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:49,707
- to put a hit out on Hank Schillinger.
- No, no.

621
00:37:49,747 --> 00:37:52,841
Oh, yeah. And Hank's dead.
Vern doesn't know it,

622
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:55,819
but that's only because
Pancamo makes sure

623
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,912
no one's gonna find
the body.

624
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,584
Let's say they do,
you know, find the body.

625
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,593
Schillinger's gonna
come back after you

626
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:06,119
and he's gonna destroy the rest
of your family. He will murder Holly.

627
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:09,224
- Fuck you.
- The second reason is,

628
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:12,896
you tell him l killed
Shemin, they will kill me.

629
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:17,104
But l think you love me
too much to see that happen.

630
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:21,806
Hey, Mondo.
How's it hanging, baby?

631
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,041
How was Browne
in bed?

632
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:27,217
Chris, don't.

633
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:29,481
You should take care
of where you stick your dick.

634
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,681
That baby is lethal.

635
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:34,351
You know, l liked it better
when we weren't speaking.

636
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:36,360
Winning and losing,
the two sides

637
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:39,454
of the same silver dollar.
But winning isn't always a good thing.

638
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,124
Think on it.

639
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:42,962
You suddenly come into
a lot of cash.

640
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,901
You start worrying
about how to spend it,

641
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:46,733
how to save it,
invest it.

642
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:49,001
You buy all this stuff
you don't really need

643
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,803
and you get weighed
the fuck down.

644
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:52,867
Losing,
on the other hand,

645
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,844
has a kind of purifying
effect.

646
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,676
When you got nothing,

647
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,080
and you're stripped
of all the doodads in life,

648
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,017
you are free.

649
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:10,358
Supreme Allah,

650
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:12,727
what is up
with Mondo Browne?

651
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,732
l mean, that boy
is nothing but trouble,

652
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:17,735
just a deluxe
pain in the ass.

653
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,458
You take care
of the other thing?

654
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:44,655
Yeah, l made your phone call.
Delivery truck's gonna get a flat tire.

655
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:49,165
Sweet.

656
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,548
Browne, get in line.

657
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:13,455
l'm waiting on a shipment.
The motherfucking truck caught a flat.

658
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:16,551
lf we miss that shipment tomorrow,
we don't have no breakfast.

659
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:18,027
l'll be back
for you later.

660
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:20,087
Everybody else,
let's go.

661
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:40,407
Looking for these?

662
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:43,045
Keller, what the fuck
are you doing here?

663
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,181
You and me, we got
personal business to do.

664
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,884
l ain't got
no business with you.

665
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:55,097
How'd you like
a blow job?

666
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,294
You sure?

667
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,438
Browne is dead.

668
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,138
Bullshit.

669
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:09,043
Murdered
in the cafeteria.

670
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,945
Hey, that's not
Em City.

671
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:13,450
He's still
one of ours, Adebisi.

672
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:15,884
Glynn is
pissed off royal.

673
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,378
Everything we've built
is on the verge of collapsing.

674
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:24,925
We found this
at the scene.

675
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:28,125
Do you know who the necklace
belongs to?

676
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:31,132
Yes.

677
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,108
- Come on.
- What's up, man?

678
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:40,110
- Come on.
- What's up?

679
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:06,896
You killed Shemin.

680
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:09,338
What the fuck am l gonna
kill Shemin for? He was nothing.

681
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:13,139
- You killed Browne.
- See?

682
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:15,941
That shit must've fell off when
l was working in the kitchen.

683
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,211
Yeah?
You cocksucker!

684
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:24,686
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Yeah, fuck me? Fuck you!

685
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:27,452
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, bitch!

686
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:30,585
Fuck you!
Fucking kill you!

687
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:31,822
Fucking up my shit!

688
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:34,559
- Fuck you!
- l'll kill you!

689
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,466
Look what was
under Supreme's pillow.

690
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,230
That fucking shit
ain't mine!

691
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,738
Fuck!
Motherfucker!

692
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,502
This is some fucking bullshit!
Get the fuck off!

693
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,703
Some fucking bullshit!

694
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:49,338
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off!

695
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,348
l ain't fucking
do that shit!

696
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:53,373
Motherfucker,
let go of me!

697
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:02,622
Let 'em out.

698
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,645
Deaths of Shemin
and Browne.

699
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:30,278
This is the hand
of God.

700
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:32,289
Maybe.

701
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:35,258
But do their deaths fit in with
your plan to bring Adebisi down?

702
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:37,261
Oh, yes.

703
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,923
l'm getting close
to Adebisi to find that one flaw

704
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:43,790
that'll finally
cripple him.

705
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:46,325
l hope
it happens soon.

706
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:55,942
Adebisi?

707
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,585
l said wind slowly.

708
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:10,594
l said slow!
Wind slow!

709
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,687
You don't know slow?
You're not even a woman.

710
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:18,735
Wait here.

711
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:24,941
Man, l got to admit,

712
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:28,468
l was struck stupid when you joined
forces with Adebisi, man.

713
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:31,811
What he's up to--
hold on.

714
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:45,329
Man, given what
you believe in,

715
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,888
man, it's tough to take
this conversion seriously.

716
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:49,866
l swore to Allah.

717
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,629
l think that swearing
of yours

718
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:53,967
got something to do
with you trying to stop him.

719
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:57,937
You always did have
a very vivid imagination.

720
00:44:57,975 --> 00:44:59,943
l'll tell you
what else l got.

721
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,707
l got the knack
for picking winners and losers,

722
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:04,715
and you,
you're gonna win.

723
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,842
Sure hope to shit
you do.

724
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:09,079
What's the matter, Poet?
You done with gangster life?

725
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,816
Man, l ain't done
with shit except Adebisi

726
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:13,824
and fucking videotapes.

727
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:15,621
Videotapes?

728
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:19,595
Yeah, he likes to record
his antics for posterity.

729
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,495
You talking about the sex
and drugs, right?

730
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,625
And life
in Party Central.

731
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,898
These videotapes,
can you get a hold of them?

732
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,440
He keeps them in his pod.

733
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:33,909
l mean, l could try.

734
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,071
Do it now.

735
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,231
Simon, can l have
a word, please?

736
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:55,994
Yeah, go ahead.

737
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:57,557
ln private.

738
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,215
Gotta get
all the young brothers

739
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:14,945
to go to class,
get an education.

740
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:18,113
- Like that, huh?
- Yeah, excellent.

741
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:38,539
You say a word

742
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:40,942
about me being in here,
you're dead.

743
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:42,946
You hear me?
You hear me?

744
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,948
Simon, l'm not done
talking with you yet.

745
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:47,416
We'll talk later.

746
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:49,442
But we have to let
Querns know.

747
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:51,478
Yeah, later.

748
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:08,968
They're in
the ceiling tiles,

749
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:10,769
but l didn't get
a chance to get one.

750
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:20,750
Lots of Native Americans,
a.k.a. lndians,

751
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:23,048
used to live on reservations
in utter poverty.

752
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,420
Alcoholism was rampant,
morale was low.

753
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:29,426
Then some chief got the
brainstorm idea

754
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,020
to use the land,
not to hunt buffalo,

755
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:34,656
but to raise money
by building a casino.

756
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:36,723
Then faster than you
can say ''Custer,''

757
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:40,225
the lives of the members
of the tribe changed for the better.

758
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:44,139
So you see, sometimes
you can eliminate your own vices

759
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:46,871
by exploiting
the vices of others.

760
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:50,547
That's crazy.

761
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:51,980
Yeah.

762
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,109
Unfortunately we don't have
another option.

763
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:56,483
You're gonna ask Adebisi if
you can move in with him,

764
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,183
- live in his pod?
- l need access to those videotapes.

765
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:03,057
What makes you think
he'll say yes?

766
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:06,355
Believe me,

767
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:08,388
he'll say yes.

768
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:14,830
Man, l don't
even smoke these.

769
00:48:17,474 --> 00:48:19,408
What's up, Poet?

770
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,104
Yo, Leroy.
What's happening, man?

771
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:23,579
- Nothing.
- Hey, Mondo, man,

772
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:26,742
he was a wild boy, man.
He got greased. You okay?

773
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:28,445
No, not really.

774
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:30,544
- Hey, give me some of that shit.
- Here, man.

775
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:35,025
Hey, it's
you and me, Poet.

776
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,027
We gotta cover
each other's backs now.

777
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,825
- Yeah.
- Adebisi is a crazy a motherfucker.

778
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:42,594
l'll tell you that,
though,

779
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:45,124
you ain't have to worry
about Adebisi that much longer.

780
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:47,831
- No?
- No, man.

781
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,272
Me and Said, we're
working on an angle.

782
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:53,469
For real?
What you up to?

783
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,877
l can't tell you that.
lt's top secret.

784
00:48:56,914 --> 00:48:58,472
- No doubt.
- No doubt.

785
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,210
l hear that.
Later, blood.

786
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,843
All right.

787
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,430
- lt's what we thought.
- Okay.

788
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,029
You want me
to whack Poet?

789
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:24,370
No, not yet.

790
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:26,501
Don't want them to know
that we know.

791
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,710
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

792
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:37,050
So...

793
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:39,521
which bunk
do you want?

794
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:43,556
When was the last time you were in
Emerald City?

795
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:44,720
l don't remember.

796
00:49:44,762 --> 00:49:46,252
- Since Querns took over?
- Probably.

797
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:48,663
Well, don't you think
it's time for another fucking visit?

798
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:50,599
Watch the way
you talk to me!

799
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:56,337
Leo, this is not
just my ego.

800
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:59,240
The behavior in there
is illegal, immoral,

801
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:01,710
and Querns
turns a blind eye.

802
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:04,805
Now you gave the man a free hand
because he kept the violence down,

803
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:07,009
but two inmates
are dead.

804
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,609
You gotta step in.

805
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:25,829
You know, l remember
when you first came to Oz.

806
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:30,163
Jefferson Keane had come
to challenge you.

807
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:33,176
You got one of your fellow
Muslims to hit you harder, harder,

808
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,940
until you bled.

809
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:37,947
l didn't know what
to make of you then.

810
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:40,142
Still don't now.

811
00:50:40,184 --> 00:50:41,981
Simon, the both of us

812
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:44,010
have been on
an extraordinary journey.

813
00:50:45,456 --> 00:50:47,048
And l've tried to learn
from mine,

814
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:50,083
tried to find
the common thing that binds us all.

815
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:51,924
Crime.

816
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,364
Crime is
the common theme.

817
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:58,368
See, we are
all of us bad men, even you.

818
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:02,562
l know you have come
to destroy me.

819
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:05,769
Simon,

820
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:08,004
l don't wanna
destroy you.

821
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:09,637
l want to help you
change.

822
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,207
That is what
would destroy me.

823
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,481
See, l am who l am,
just as you are.

824
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,421
And l do what l do,

825
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,220
just as you must.

826
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:24,386
Does that mean you're
gonna kill me?

827
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,021
Kill you?

828
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:31,762
l wanna kiss you.

829
00:51:31,802 --> 00:51:35,101
But because l admire you
more than l desire you.

830
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:49,375
This is what
you came for.

831
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:52,812
Why are you
giving this to me?

832
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:59,158
Because l have
everything--

833
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:02,132
everything l need,

834
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:04,828
every love satisfied,

835
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:07,029
but it's not enough.

836
00:52:08,038 --> 00:52:09,767
lt'll never be enough.

837
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,570
But like you said,

838
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,475
between the pair of us,
we can do great things for our people.

839
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,945
But for what?

840
00:52:18,816 --> 00:52:21,842
We're still in Oz.

841
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:37,463
Yeah!

842
00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:42,195
Kiss my foot,
kiss it.

843
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:47,237
Turn it off.
l've seen enough.

844
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,211
Leo,

845
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:52,272
What are you gonna say, Querns?
You gonna hand me a lot of excuses?

846
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:54,284
You didn't know?
You did know?

847
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,548
lt doesn't matter.
You're fired.

848
00:52:56,587 --> 00:53:00,683
Officer, escort Mr. Querns
off the property.

849
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:02,954
Let me at least
clean out my office.

850
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:04,961
We'll send you
your belongings.

851
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:06,394
Get out.

852
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:12,663
You have yourself
a lovely evening.

853
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:19,442
This is all
my fucking fault.

854
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:22,377
Been so caught up in the campaign,
l haven't been doing my job.

855
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:27,474
You want Em City back?

856
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:29,509
Let me think it over--
yes.

857
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,730
All right,
listen up, everybody.

858
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:43,665
l'm back.

859
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,965
The following are
being transferred out of Em City.

860
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:49,234
When you hear your name,
pack up your belongings,

861
00:53:49,273 --> 00:53:51,434
line up
behind Officer Johnson.

862
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:55,070
93A234, Adebisi;

863
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,216
- 00T255, Tidd;
- What the fuck?

864
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:04,778
097 C332, Cody;

865
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:08,382
00W216, Washington.

866
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:16,125
So the end
is here, huh?

867
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:19,329
No, more likely things are gonna go
back to the way they were before.

868
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:22,532
Oh, not for me,
or for you.

869
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:23,801
You said you weren't
gonna kill me!

870
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,365
You swore to Allah
that you were my brother.

871
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,970
- And l meant that.
- Liar!

872
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:30,536
Liar.

873
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:33,277
l gave you that tape
as a final test

874
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,649
of your loyalty,
your friendship,

875
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,448
- your love!
- Oh, God!

876
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:41,889
- This is how l'm gonna die.
- No!

877
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:43,756
No!

878
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:46,558
Oh, yes, yes!

879
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:29,963
This is 25,
we got a 16.

880
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:43,980
Drop it.

881
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:47,684
Drop it! Drop the shank!

882
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,655
Easy, easy.

883
00:55:58,135 --> 00:55:59,500
Let me go!
