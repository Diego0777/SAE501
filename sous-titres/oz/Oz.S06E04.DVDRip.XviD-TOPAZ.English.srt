1
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,695
Oz

2
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:36,320
Oz

3
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,728
In the beginning
was the word.

4
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,325
And the word was with God,
and the word was God.

5
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,632
So, from the starting gun,
it's all about the word.

6
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,605
All about communication.

7
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,608
Couple million millennia
go by, along comes man.

8
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,337
God wants somebody
to chat with.

9
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,437
Turns out man wants
more than that.

10
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,848
Man wants the gossip page
and phone sex,

11
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,819
reruns of "Seinfeld"
and auctions in cyberspace.

12
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,381
Man's got his own plan
as far as communication goes

13
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,121
and the inventions to see it through.
And poor God...

14
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,324
He's still got
no one to talk to.

15
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,600
Thanks for getting here
so quick.

16
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,132
So tell me,
what happened?

17
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,735
About an hour ago

18
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,542
a man posing as
a newspaper reporter...

19
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,674
...entered the visiting
room to see Kareem Said.

20
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,185
- He pulled out a gun...
...shot Said dead.

21
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,450
Oh my God.

22
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,481
Get the fuck
out of here, man!

23
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,105
Your press pass

24
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,541
says that your name
is Lemuel Idzik.

25
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,740
Is that in fact
your real name?

26
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,340
Who'd make up
a name like that?

27
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,908
Yes.

28
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,715
Idzik.

29
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,689
I'm Detective McGorry,
Homicide.

30
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,692
I need to ask you
some questions.

31
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,162
I did it.
I killed Kareem Said.

32
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,062
What more is there?

33
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,862
You'd be willing
to sign a confession.

34
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,300
Yes.

35
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,999
You write out the words,
and I'll sign it

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,136
in my best penmanship.

37
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,667
After I've read you your rights,

38
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,339
I'll want you to tell me
what happened.

39
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,416
Here's all I'll say.

40
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,614
I had to kill him

41
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,819
before nightfall.

42
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,595
Leo, we just got an inquiry
from a local TV station

43
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,570
wanting verification
of Said's death.

44
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,664
Shit!
How'd the word get out so fast?

45
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,505
I guess the Muslims
must have contacted them.

46
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,103
Well, don't call
the station back just yet.

47
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,238
They said they're
sending over a news truck.

48
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,010
Well, don't let them
on the grounds.

49
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,449
Have them park in that empty
lot across Monroe Boulevard.

50
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,719
Well, that was
relatively easy.

51
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,591
- Did Idzik say why he killed Said?
- No.

52
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,062
No, he just kept
talking about nightfall,

53
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,088
whatever the hell
that means.

54
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,191
I'm gonna
take him downtown.

55
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,600
And I'm gonna find out
how the fuck a man with a gun

56
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,901
could get into Oz.

57
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,276
According to the logbook,
you signed Lemuel Idzik in.

58
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,373
Seems so, sir.

59
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,748
And you checked him
thoroughly for weapons?

60
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,776
He went through
the metal detector

61
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,287
same as everyone else.

62
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,755
And the machine
didn't go off?

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,917
No, sir.
Would've noticed it.

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,553
Breese, I've had
to discipline you twice

65
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,426
for drinking on duty.

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,488
I can smell the alcohol
on your breath.

67
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,524
- My wife's got cancer.
- Look, I don't care!

68
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,593
You have a job, man,
a responsibility.

69
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,502
And you failed.

70
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,507
As a result
a man is dead.

71
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,566
A prisoner.

72
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,313
Here's what
I want you to do.

73
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,816
Change out
of your uniform,

74
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,318
and then get the fuck

75
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,584
out of my prison!

76
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,353
The way things are going,
it won't be yours much longer.

77
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,934
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck's going on?

78
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,768
Mayor Loewen, Harrison Beecher,
Schibetta, Kirk,

79
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,640
now Kareem Said,
all murdered in a matter of weeks.

80
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,372
There doesn't seem to be a link
between any of these deaths.

81
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,676
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

82
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,683
Do you have any suspects
for the Wilson Loewen case?

83
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,651
There were 11 men
on the ward that night.

84
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,312
All of them
are suspects.

85
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,982
The difficulty is
narrowing the list.

86
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,585
Look, just pick someone,
any of these scumbags.

87
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,221
Governor, you're not actually
suggesting that I do that?

88
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,960
I'm suggesting that you do
your job, McGorry, and fast,

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,468
before I tell
the police commissioner

90
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,802
to put another
Sherlock in charge.

91
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,872
So, Detective,
now what?

92
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,907
Beats me.

93
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,319
Easy answer is that a black man
murdered Loewen,

94
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,188
only my gut tells me
that's not what happened.

95
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,286
This isn't about prejudice.
This... this is personal.

96
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,230
Somebody hired somebody
to kill Loewen.

97
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,166
Yeah, but who
and why?

98
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,735
The printing press
changed the world forever,

99
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,438
and for the better.

100
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,039
Bibles got printed in vernacular
rather than Latin,

101
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,448
bringing God out
of the Dark Ages,

102
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,645
out of dark corners,

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,019
to ordinary folks
like you and me.

104
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,682
But imagine old Gutenberg
at a newsstand today.

105
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,960
Think he'd be proud
of paving the way for "Jugs,"

106
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,093
"High Times"
and "Soldier of Fortune"?

107
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,573
Well, look who's back.

108
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,473
What's with
the news trucks outside?

109
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,035
Oh, you know.
Same old nonsense.

110
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,944
Metal objects.

111
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,750
Step through.

112
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,048
Who are you
here to see?

113
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,489
My client
Chris Keller.

114
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,323
Client. Is that what
they're calling it now?

115
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,525
Are you carrying any alcohol,
drugs, weapons or explosives?

116
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,796
- No.
- Very good, sign here.

117
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,430
Social security number there,
favorite color there.

118
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,506
A little humor
breaks up the day.

119
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,685
You going in
or not, Beecher?

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,504
- Tobias...
- Hey.

121
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,705
Tobias, I have...

122
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,179
I have terrible news.

123
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,115
Kareem Said
is dead.

124
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,446
What?

125
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,956
Brice Tibbets' murder case.

126
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,292
A witness has come forward.
Imagine that.

127
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,564
So, we're going
to file a motion today

128
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,366
to have your
death sentence overturned.

129
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,532
Toby, do you really think
there's a chance?

130
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,509
I mean,
with this eyewitness?

131
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,069
Well, you see,
he's the key.

132
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,673
I kept wondering why
Jerry Heekin waited

133
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,013
four years to contact
the authorities.

134
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,042
And then the law firm
did some digging.

135
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,816
Heekin was caught dealing
crack, your dad told me.

136
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,845
Last year.

137
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,121
And he was arrested for the third time.
Three strikes, right?

138
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,526
So, hoping for a deal
he goes to the FBI,

139
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,554
says he saw you
dump Brice Tibbets' body.

140
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,364
Whether he did or not
is immaterial,

141
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,200
because I think your pal
Agent Taylor

142
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,502
helped him fill in
most of the details.

143
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,138
In Heekin's initial conversation
with the FBI,

144
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,944
he doesn't say anything
about the flashlight.

145
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,075
Only afterwards, to the D.A.

146
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,176
Does he add the flashlight
to the story.

147
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,687
Which is bullshit,
right?

148
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,283
Because you would've noticed
somebody shining a flashlight on you.

149
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,226
Especially if you're
dumping a dead body.

150
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,890
Oh, Christ Almighty, this is
what I kept saying to McClain.

151
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,161
Well,
the bottom line is,

152
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,192
he can cut a deal with the D.A.
Pending your conviction.

153
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,672
Because of that, we can imply
Heekin made up the whole story

154
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,107
or was given the account
by Agent Taylor.

155
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,009
Unreliable witness testimony

156
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,070
plus prosecutorial misconduct

157
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,173
equals an overturned verdict.

158
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,843
That's beautiful.

159
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,192
Can you girls keep
the giggling down?

160
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,490
Yeah, I'd better
get over to the courthouse.

161
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,053
Hey, all we've been doing
is talking about legal shit.

162
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,931
How you doing...

163
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,527
with your father gone
and now Said?

164
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,468
Hey, it's okay.

165
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,669
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,444
Toby, what's it like...

167
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,816
being free?

168
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,254
It's, uh...

169
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,057
the zoo,
the soccer field.

170
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,889
We're outdoors constantly,
you know?

171
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,662
Spending time
with my kids, real time.

172
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,172
It's little things, like helping them
with their homework.

173
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,503
Going to P.T.S.A. Meetings.

174
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,640
Holly's teacher is this
really funny, smart woman.

175
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,947
You'd love her.
She's...

176
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,613
she makes me laugh out loud.

177
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,655
I'm happy for you, Toby.

178
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,927
- I'm happy for you.
- Hey, what'd I tell you two?

179
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,489
No smooching!

180
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,196
Time to go.

181
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,568
Get me out of here.

182
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,933
Get me the fuck away
from Lopresti.

183
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,788
Thank you, Officer.
Good morning.

184
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,661
- Hello, gorgeous.
- We're in that kind of mood, huh?

185
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,895
All right,
under a new state law

186
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,132
every six months
I have to review

187
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,139
the mental health
of every resident

188
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,232
of death row
and it's your turn.

189
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,068
So, how's your
mental health?

190
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,810
Beecher seems to think my days
on death row are numbered.

191
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,978
Yeah, I know.
I saw him earlier.

192
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,748
How'd he seem to you?

193
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,181
Well, he's obviously
grieving for the loss

194
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,716
of his father and Said.

195
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,820
Yeah, I mean
other than that.

196
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,696
What are you
asking me exactly?

197
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,031
Beecher's in love.

198
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,739
Really?
Did he say so?

199
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
I can tell.

200
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,480
And how does
that make you feel?

201
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,180
I don't know.

202
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,950
Come on, Chris,
don't bull me.

203
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,458
How does that
make you feel?

204
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,153
Happy!

205
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,389
- For him?
- Yes.

206
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,329
And for you?

207
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,162
Jealous.

208
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,260
And what are you going
to do with that jealousy?

209
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,137
Chew on it? Suck on it?
Devour it whole?

210
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,041
Yeah, okay?

211
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,510
Beecher has what I want!
I want a life!

212
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,083
I get executed
and he lives a long old life

213
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,054
surrounded by
his grandchildren.

214
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,079
I want a life!

215
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,766
You can't expect me
not to be a little envious.

216
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,795
Sure I can.

217
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,969
If you truly love him,
I expect that and more.

218
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,211
I'll write in my review
that you're behaving normally.

219
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,630
Mail call.

220
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,872
Hey, Vern, I heard
about your pal Loewen.

221
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,671
A tragedy.
A fuckin' tragedy.

222
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,045
Well well well,
look at this.

223
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,414
The three of us
together again. I'm all misty.

224
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,476
Hey, Vern,
wait a minute.

225
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,919
I want you to hear something.
You too, Lopresti.

226
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,446
"Upon considering the body
of relevant precedence

227
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,291
in general and in holdings
of the court blah blah blah,

228
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,955
I am compelled
to conclude that

229
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,761
the petitioner's claim
is meritorious."

230
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,461
- Meaning?
- You're out of here.

231
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,470
- No shit?
- No shit.

232
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,564
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

233
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,802
Toby.

234
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,505
I owe you my life.
I owe you my life.

235
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,606
I owe you my life.

236
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,234
Winthrop.

237
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,903
You're Keller, right?

238
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,345
Mm-hmm.

239
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,213
- I heard plenty of stories about you.
- Yeah?

240
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,548
I've heard a couple
about you myself.

241
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,110
There's one in particular
that interests me.

242
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,623
I interest you?

243
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,687
Fascinate
is a better word.

244
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,094
Meet me later,

245
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,621
storage closet, unit B.

246
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,930
Okay.

247
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,809
Nice.

248
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,788
I thought you only
had eyes for Beecher.

249
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,054
Beecher's the one who
brought you and me together.

250
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,220
- What do you mean?
- That story I heard,

251
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,729
the one that fascinates me.

252
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,755
Yeah?

253
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,267
That's the one where you
killed Beecher's father.

254
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,863
No no! No no!

255
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,141
Hey, Keller.

256
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,517
How's it feel to be
back in the gen pop?

257
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,522
Sweet.

258
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,454
One day in 1876,

259
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,558
Alexander Graham Bell
uttered through a wire,

260
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,092
"Watson, come here.
I want you."

261
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,971
130 years later we're talking
through satellites.

262
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,498
Strange, huh,
that before hanging up

263
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,807
we say,
"Keep in touch,"

264
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,370
when there's never
any touch involved,

265
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,609
no contact.

266
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,209
Just cables
and frequencies.

267
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,550
Still...

268
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,249
to get
an l-love-you call

269
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,985
in the middle
of a shitty day,

270
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,756
that makes a cell phone
seem miraculous.

271
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,458
By and large, things are
off to a good start.

272
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,524
A few glitches, but nothing
I didn't factor in.

273
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,536
I confess, I'm the type
who hangs up as soon

274
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,299
as I smell
a solicitation.

275
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,431
What percentage of these
calls actually get people

276
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,806
to donate to Senator
Laken's campaign?

277
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,244
Believe it or not, you only need
a 1-2% success rate

278
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,180
for telemarketing
to be effective.

279
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,842
2%?

280
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,478
I like to do better. My numbers
are hovering in the 5-6% range.

281
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,182
Your men are proving
to be very effective.

282
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,952
- Mrs. Howard?
- Yes.

283
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,051
Good afternoon. I'm calling
on behalf of the campaign

284
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,962
to re-elect Archibald Laken into
the United States Senate.

285
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,555
May I have a moment
of your time?

286
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,760
- Sure.
- Thank you.

287
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,531
Mr. Erickson, good afternoon,
I'm calling on behalf of...

288
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,266
Mrs. Sharif,
good afternoon.

289
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,742
Persevere,
Kenaniah, persevere.

290
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,583
Senator Laken's record
has been outstanding,

291
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,746
especially in regard
to education,

292
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,122
national security
and anti-crime measures.

293
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,821
How are the others
holding up?

294
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,925
We're sad...

295
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,129
demoralized, you know.

296
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,236
Kareem had made plans for us
to start a bookbinding business,

297
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,142
and the preparations
are in motion.

298
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,305
And the first book
was supposed to be

299
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,644
Augustus Hill's memoir?

300
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,517
Well, you have
to keep going, Zahir.

301
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,282
In order to honor
them both,

302
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,256
you have to galvanize your
men to complete the task

303
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,849
Said set for you.

304
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,861
I tried to lead
once before.

305
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,830
I failed.

306
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,196
You know,

307
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,498
Said and I
didn't always agree,

308
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,165
but I know one thing,

309
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,004
this is the moment
he would've trusted in Allah.

310
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,773
I've spoken to the publisher
of Hill's book.

311
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,282
He wants to go forward.

312
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,343
So, it's up to us
to fulfill the promise,

313
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,254
to achieve the vision
of Minister Said.

314
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,521
But first, we must
choose someone to lead.

315
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,525
I nominate Zahir Arif.

316
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,467
All in favor?

317
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,012
Yo, what'd you call me?

318
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,571
Yo, fuck you,
you greasy old bitch.

319
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,708
- Hey, Poet.
- Oh, what you think?

320
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,686
I don't know where 122 Wayne Street is?
Think again, bitch.

321
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,519
What the fuck's wrong
with you, son?

322
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,582
Nah, she said
she wasn't about to give

323
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,753
her credit card number
to some strange spook.

324
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,592
How the fuck
she even know I was black?

325
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,598
That's irrelevant.

326
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,965
You hang up and calmly
move on to the next call.

327
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,698
No, man, fuck that.
I ain't putting my pride on the line,

328
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,502
so some bullshit senator
can get re-elected.

329
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,870
Well, in that case,
you're fired.

330
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,471
- What?
- You heard me.

331
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,572
Carry your lazy ass

332
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,176
and that bad attitude
off the premises!

333
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,187
- Move it.
- Fuck you, Burr.

334
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,755
Fuck you!

335
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,996
Well, what the fuck
you looking at?

336
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,301
Get back to work.

337
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,432
All of you!

338
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,726
It's a good thing
we got out now, yo.

339
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,289
I'll tell you.

340
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,359
Man, that telemarketing,
man,

341
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,600
- that shit short the brain.
- Yo, no shit.

342
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,732
I'll tell you,
I got a plan, though.

343
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:53,040
Yo, we're going
to work for Arif.

344
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,046
McManus
and the Sicilians

345
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,571
will think we're
done dealing, right?

346
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,379
We lay low for a minute,

347
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,909
then we come back
double-time

348
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,922
up underneath
the radar without Burr.

349
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,323
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, son.

350
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,727
Sounds like quite
a crowd out there.

351
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,321
Yeah, I know.

352
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,198
So, I spoke with Augustus'
wife and the Hudack family.

353
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,032
And everyone's willing to make
a deal on the royalties,

354
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,904
so, we can move forward.
It's exciting.

355
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah, and terrifying.

356
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,640
Should we open
the doors?

357
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,387
Nacim, close the door.

358
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,586
Hold up for just
another minute.

359
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,424
- What you doing?
- Hold up.

360
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,658
We need to pray.
We need to pray.

361
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,810
Miss Coffo,
I finished the book.

362
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,511
- That was fast.
- It was good, funny.

363
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,850
Sit down and tell me what you liked
about it and what you didn't.

364
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,618
I can't right now. I got
some business to attend to.

365
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,852
- Business?
- I'll come back tomorrow.

366
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,226
In the meantime, can you
find me another book?

367
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,696
On baseball?

368
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,199
Whatever, as long
as it's funny and good.

369
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,098
Bob, I'm a perfect mess.
Hello, Stella.

370
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,940
Today's the day I'm supposed
to see Norma and I'm wavering.

371
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,774
Don't waver,
Agamemnon.

372
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,439
Put on a tie,
some aftershave,

373
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,710
slick your hair back
like you always do.

374
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,843
It's time Norma and I see each other
for who we really are,

375
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,751
liver spots and all.

376
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,722
Why am I putting myself
through this?

377
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,815
Because a part of you
is in love,

378
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,883
and that's the part
that matters.

379
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,918
You've been reading
too much poetry, Bob.

380
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,827
Love sucks, remember?

381
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,597
Hello.

382
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,837
Nice to see you.

383
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,573
Please, let's skip the pleasantries.
We know why we're here.

384
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,774
I should just dive
right into an explanation.

385
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,478
After stranding me at the altar
and then getting pregnant,

386
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,214
- yeah, I think that you should.
- Okay.

387
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,155
Basically, I got stuck
in that snowstorm

388
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,216
on the way
to our wedding.

389
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,319
As I sat there trapped,
I had time to think.

390
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,387
All along,
I had told myself

391
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,025
I could handle a marriage
to a man in prison.

392
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,503
But sitting there,
I had clarity for the first time

393
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,165
about how hard
it would really be.

394
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,107
I used my cell phone
to call Elliot.

395
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,666
Elliot?
Who's Elliot?

396
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,110
The man I was with
when I met you.

397
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,307
You had a boyfriend
when we met

398
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,373
and you
dumped him for me?

399
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,443
- Yes.
- Oh, wow.

400
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,979
Anyway, Elliot comes and digs me out
and we go to dinner.

401
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,991
He tells me his mom died

402
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,461
and I guess we both drowned our
sorrows in a bottle of cheap wine.

403
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,327
One thing led
to another and well...

404
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,991
He had you
for dessert.

405
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,023
But during the sex
I thought of you.

406
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,037
It's not a delusion,
what you and I feel.

407
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,868
It's love.

408
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,241
"Think not,
thou canst weep a tear

409
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,905
and thy Maker
is not near.

410
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,380
Oh, He gives us His joy

411
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,976
that our grief
He may destroy

412
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,955
till our grief
is fled and gone,

413
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,255
He doth sit by us
and moan."

414
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,122
I love the timbre
of your voice, Robert.

415
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,360
Wrap it up,
Rebadow.

416
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,993
Five minutes
to count.

417
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,936
Fine, I'll be there
in four.

418
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,996
Don't be late,
lover boy.

419
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,835
Did you know that Blake
and his wife used to sit

420
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,315
in their garden and read
to each other naked?

421
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,814
With no concern
for the passerby.

422
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,549
This may sound crazy,
Stella,

423
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,357
but I want to do that
with you, just once.

424
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,193
Oz has a garden?

425
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,163
I could pay a C.O.
For privacy,

426
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,192
and you could bring
a plant.

427
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,099
We'll lock the door,
kill the lights,

428
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,133
sit by a candle to read

429
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,168
"The Marriage
of Heaven and Hell,"

430
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,544
naked as the day
we were born.

431
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,176
It's a lovely thought,

432
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:30,017
but I don't know
if I can even finish

433
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,080
what I've started here.

434
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,581
Robert, I'm sick.

435
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:39,119
I've been diagnosed
with breast cancer.

436
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,961
Oh, don't start
imagining the worst.

437
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,698
I'm gonna be okay.

438
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,008
I can't be late
for count.

439
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,164
You okay?

440
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,997
Fine.

441
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,198
The most noncommittal word
in the English language, fine.

442
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,103
So, I've been
thinking...

443
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,608
I might let Norma
bring her baby in.

444
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,873
- Oh.
- I'm not sure.

445
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,574
But she did dump the jerk
for me in the first place.

446
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,106
I guess the bottom line
is the ego doesn't need

447
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,984
- that much to rebound.
- Uh-huh.

448
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,512
Besides,
his name's Elliot.

449
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,922
Who can be jealous
of a guy named Elliot?

450
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,822
Bob, what's with you today?

451
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,423
You do remember telling me
I should see her, don't you?

452
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,093
I forgot to say
to be careful.

453
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,400
We're full of false
fantasies, Agamemnon.

454
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,702
See her, yes,
but cover your ass.

455
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,867
You said yourself
love sucks.

456
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,070
There's nothing to be
gained from your pains,

457
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,375
except more pain.

458
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,716
Midway through
the 20th century,

459
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:17,023
man wants communication
without communication!

460
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,656
He wants to sit
in his living room

461
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,634
and watch people
in a box

462
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,499
fall in love,

463
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,700
work, sing, golf,

464
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,231
cry, fuck

465
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,267
and fuck up.

466
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,745
Television!

467
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,580
A one-way conversation
between you and the world,

468
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,178
where the world
does the talking!

469
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,679
Like God,

470
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,286
man can finally create man

471
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,228
in his own image

472
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:56,723
and then kick back and watch
all sorts of shit hit the fan.

473
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,962
Okay, Cyril,

474
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,804
time for another
fabulous E.C.T. Treatment.

475
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,834
What's E.C. T?

476
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,846
Jesus, why is
it every time,

477
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,848
I got to tell you
what E.C.T. Means?

478
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,908
That's because electroshock
causes memory loss.

479
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,546
Oh.

480
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,613
Jaz?

481
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,822
Jaz?

482
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,163
Jaz, it's very important
that we talk.

483
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,669
Your execution is
set for next week.

484
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,901
16 devils.
Today, there were 16.

485
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,103
I appreciate your stopping
by to see me, Miss Lang.

486
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,174
I'm thrilled when anyone shows
an interest in Jaz Hoyt.

487
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,618
Arnie Zelman seems to be
getting all the death row publicity

488
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,315
for his client,
Cyril O'Reilly.

489
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,792
God, Zelman
is a P.R. Genius.

490
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,386
How's Hoyt's appeal going?

491
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,727
Well, through the testimony
of various psychiatrists,

492
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,893
some of whom have been treating
Hoyt since he was 6 years old,

493
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,733
I think I've been able
to build a fairly solid case.

494
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,706
And your contention is that
he's always been crazy?

495
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,402
Yes.

496
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,138
As a child
he tortured animals,

497
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,774
sodomized a playmate.

498
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,944
And where were his parents
during all of this? In a bar, drunk?

499
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,977
Actually, in Captiva.

500
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,422
Hoyt comes from money,
Father Mukada,

501
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,947
lots of money.

502
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,189
He went to Exeter.
He dropped out of Harvard.

503
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:35,165
This whole Jaz-bad- biker thing
is part of his delusion.

504
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,397
Holy shit, he's rich?

505
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,768
Well, who do you think's
paying for my fees?

506
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,397
Pater and mater.

507
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,538
Hearing the music

508
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,676
and I saw
another buffalo.

509
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:57,154
And I saw a dog,
and I saw one...

510
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,185
I saw two wolves...

511
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,992
I saw two...
two wolves...

512
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,796
And on a more
controversial note,

513
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,926
in a stunning defeat
for state prosecutors,

514
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,666
convicted murderer Jaz Hoyt's
death sentence was overturned.

515
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,334
Instead of being
executed as scheduled,

516
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,867
Hoyt will be moved to the Oswald
Correctional Facility's psychiatric unit

517
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,643
and then later to the Connelly
Institute, a hospital in Morrisville,

518
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,048
which specializes in treating
the criminally insane.

519
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,213
This is bullshit! How come
fuckin' Hoyt gets off and Cyril doesn't?

520
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,382
From a purely legal
standpoint, the circumstances

521
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,186
of each case
are very different.

522
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,750
You're telling me that in the eyes
of the law, Jaz Hoyt's life

523
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,659
is worth preserving
and my brother's isn't?

524
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,062
- Afraid so, Ryan.
- God damn it!

525
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,499
Unless our latest appeal
is accepted by the court,

526
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,298
Cyril dies
two weeks from Thursday.

527
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,929
Fuck.

528
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,942
Prisoner #03N679:

529
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,539
Jahfree Neema;

530
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,915
Convicted January 10th,
2003;

531
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,217
Kidnapping, assault;
Sentence: Seven years;

532
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,519
Up for parole in three.

533
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,821
In other news,
'60s radical Jahfree Neema

534
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,226
was convicted today
of kidnapping his daughter

535
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,230
from the Pinkel
Day Care Center.

536
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,927
Mr. Neema, a prominent community
leader on the city's east side,

537
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,960
was at one time involved
in the Black Panthers.

538
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:25,307
This castle hath
a pleasant seat.

539
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,506
The air nimbly
and sweetly

540
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,447
recommends itself
unto our gentle senses.

541
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,145
This quest of summer,
the temple-haunting marlet.

542
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:38,178
All right, that's it.
Rehearsal's over.

543
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:41,521
- But I didn't even...
- Tomorrow at 3:00.

544
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,789
It's okay. We'll get to it.
Thank you.

545
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,887
- Things humming, Ma?
- Oh, Ryan,

546
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,091
well, not exactly.

547
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,532
We haven't found anybody
to replace Schibetta

548
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,469
in the lead and...
Ryan, I need to talk to you,

549
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,473
- but I don't know where to start.
- Just start.

550
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,737
Right.

551
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:03,338
- Jahfree Neema is coming to Oz.
- Hey, Ma, seriously.

552
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,975
I know the man.
At least, I knew him.

553
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,985
He... he was the one
that convinced me

554
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,510
to join the peace movement.
He was the one that...

555
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,991
He's the one that got you
to leave Dad and abandon me, right?

556
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,085
That's one way
of putting it.

557
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,895
You have to understand, he was
very passionate about his beliefs.

558
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,561
- He's a very charismatic man...
- Did you fuck him?

559
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,901
You did.

560
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,601
Ryan. Look, we're
both adults here.

561
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,235
You know what it was like
living with your father.

562
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,178
It was very repressive, and Jahfree
helped me to free myself

563
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,842
and I'm telling you this
because I want you to know

564
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,818
that he changed my life
for the better.

565
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,548
Uh-huh.

566
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:48,081
I'm just asking you to be
open to him, that's all.

567
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,390
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

568
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,988
Maybe I'll call him
Uncle Jahfree.

569
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,264
Later, man.

570
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,772
Hey.

571
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,707
How they hanging
there, bud?

572
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,437
Do I know you?

573
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,969
Indirectly. Suzanne Fitzgerald,
she's my mom.

574
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,448
So?

575
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,008
Get out of my cell.

576
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,113
She just asked me to come down
here and try to, you know...

577
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,819
Get out of my cell,
white boy.

578
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,726
Asshole.

579
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,403
Hey.

580
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,337
Back in the '60s,

581
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,366
the Department of Defense
created the Internet.

582
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,675
Little did they know
they were mixing concrete

583
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,204
to build
the global village.

584
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,843
There's nothing concrete
about it, though.

585
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,445
People get digital mail

586
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,752
from electronic boxes,

587
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,417
they congregate
in chat rooms

588
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,255
that have no walls
and no doors.

589
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,557
Millions around the world
have instant access

590
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:35,532
to each other and stores
and food and entertainment.

591
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:39,468
But if it's such a revolution
in communications,

592
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,166
why do studies show

593
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,198
the more time
one spends online,

594
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,235
the more isolation
one suffers?

595
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,443
We've been contacted by
a lawyer for one Greg Penders,

596
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,747
a resident of solitary
confinement.

597
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,013
He's suing the state.

598
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,419
Because of the methylene
chloride poisoning?

599
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,549
Yes, he says the death
of Carlos Martinez

600
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,924
is proof the prison put his own life
in unnecessary danger.

601
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,021
Penders is trying to get
the Martinez family and Omar White

602
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,055
- to join in the lawsuit.
- Christ.

603
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,295
I warned you not to go
public too soon,

604
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,236
- not to have that press conference.
- Ellie, please!

605
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,571
The last thing I need to hear
right now is "I told you so."

606
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,246
This is gonna work,
Omar, I guarantee it.

607
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,874
I guarantee it.

608
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,385
The word's out that
the air in here is toxic,

609
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,886
that it's lethal as shit.

610
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,855
You've got to join
my class-action suit.

611
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,551
You've got to do it.

612
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,397
I understand you want
to speak with me.

613
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,991
Omar, who's out there?
What's going on?

614
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,998
Okay, you let me
out of solitary, right,

615
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,340
back to Em City?

616
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,143
And I won't sue
with Penders.

617
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,773
That's all I get
in the deal?

618
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,750
Well, what more
do you want, man?

619
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,948
Look around, I ain't got...
I ain't got much to offer.

620
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,422
Here's an idea,

621
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,516
I put you back
in Em City

622
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,926
and you don't mention a word
of this conversation to anyone.

623
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,363
Not a fucking syllable.

624
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,834
Oh, no, fuck syllable, I mean,
not even a fucking letter, okay?

625
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,530
But if you do talk,

626
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,664
I will build a cell so small

627
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,402
you won't have
room to stand.

628
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,342
There'll just be room
enough for you

629
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,073
and that yappity mouth
of yours, got it?

630
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,811
We never spoke.

631
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,752
Omar.

632
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,160
White back in Em City?

633
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,172
No fucking way, Leo.
I've had enough of his bullshit.

634
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,198
Tim, do you really expect me
to put your headaches

635
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,405
with one inmate
above the larger burdens

636
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,881
of this prison?
I didn't think so.

637
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,388
Allahu Akbar.

638
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:19,590
Allahu Akbar.

639
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,224
Arif, where's
my man Said?

640
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,791
Allahu Akbar.

641
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:28,737
- Seriously, where is he?
- Said's dead, White.

642
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,936
- What?
- Somebody shot him. Come on.

643
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,604
Come on, let's go.

644
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,340
McManus.

645
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,439
McManus.

646
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,780
- McManus.
- Today, White!

647
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,116
The autopsy report
on Carlos Martinez.

648
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,122
You'll be glad to know
that he didn't die

649
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,454
of methylene chloride poisoning.
He suffocated.

650
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,789
Or I should say he was
suffocated by someone else.

651
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,953
What?

652
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,725
I guess that's one less plaintiff
for you to worry about, right?

653
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,159
You still pissed off at me

654
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,036
for not sending Martinez
to Benchley Memorial?

655
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,234
Yes.

656
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,073
But not half as much
as I am at myself.

657
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:11,013
You know what's really
disgusting about this?

658
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:15,041
I'm relieved that a prisoner
was killed in his sleep

659
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,953
instead of dying of what might
have been a preventable death.

660
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,683
Now, I'm not guilty.

661
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,749
Now, l...

662
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,125
I'm just horrified
to find myself thinking this way.

663
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,325
Do you know what?
That is the last time

664
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,164
I take care of Oz
over a person.

665
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,195
Great.

666
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,902
I've got another murder
investigation on my hands.

667
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,707
So, what are you accusing
me of, killing Martinez?

668
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,614
Look, normally I could sweep
this thing under the rug,

669
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,913
but since we've had
this rash of murders

670
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,045
and I went public with
the methylene chloride

671
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,918
promising to release
the autopsy,

672
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,424
the media is not
gonna let this go.

673
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,426
They're going to scream
for an investigation.

674
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,657
And I need to learn
every detail I can.

675
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,188
Okay, sorry.

676
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,600
You told Officer Murphy you visited
Martinez just before he died.

677
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,467
Yeah.

678
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,303
Martinez sent word
that he wanted to see me

679
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,673
'cause he was desperate
to confess that Morales

680
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,076
was the one who ordered him
to cut my tendon.

681
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,171
Did you see
anything suspicious?

682
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,183
Any threat from
the other patients?

683
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,844
No.

684
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,719
Well, you ask me, one of the Latinos
did the deed, sir.

685
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,417
They work as orderlies
in the ward.

686
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,653
They had opportunity
and motive.

687
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,857
You mean to keep Martinez
from jabbering on Morales?

688
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,196
Yes.

689
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,534
Look, Dave,

690
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,005
I'm gonna bring in
the homicide unit,

691
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,474
same as I did on
the Loewen murder.

692
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,205
They may want you to take
a lie detector test.

693
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,679
So, I am a suspect.

694
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,944
Unfortunately, for now,

695
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,543
you're the prime.

696
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,021
I'm so innocent it hurts.

697
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,115
Then what are you
worried about?

698
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,126
Take the fucking
lie detector test.

699
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,560
- I can't.
- Why?

700
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,064
Because I did lie.

701
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,588
I don't understand.

702
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,761
I lied about Martinez
blaming Morales.

703
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,895
What?

704
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,168
I didn't even see Martinez
the night he died.

705
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,175
Oh, Jesus, Dave.

706
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,701
You and I both know
that Morales is guilty.

707
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,373
I simply took Martinez's
death as an opportunity

708
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,315
to nail that motherfucker.

709
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,148
What we did, getting Morales
in solitary, cutting him up...

710
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,177
Was totally justified.

711
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,122
No, because
we had no proof.

712
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,388
Don't get all righteous
with me, you bastard.

713
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:42,156
It was my leg that got cut,
my life that got fucked.

714
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,464
Man, you got to go tell
Glynn the truth, all right?

715
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,596
Because we've got to get
Morales out of solitary.

716
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,730
No.

717
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,400
All right,
if you don't, I will.

718
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,171
Fuck that!

719
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,610
For Jesus' sake,
stop it.

720
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,773
Stop it.
Go go.

721
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,171
- Dr. Nathan?
- Oh, hi.

722
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,697
Come in.

723
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,506
Thanks for coming.

724
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,480
Look, I want to apologize
for getting so upset

725
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,483
the night Martinez died
and for firing you.

726
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,042
The chemical poisoning
thing in solitary

727
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,646
has put me under
a lot of stress,

728
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,385
and I know what it's like
to get blamed for things

729
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,519
that really aren't
under your control.

730
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,860
And if you still want
your job, it's yours.

731
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,990
Oh, Dr. Nathan,
thank you.

732
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,263
I'll do my best, I swear,
to make you proud.

733
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,532
Well, let's get to work.

734
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,638
Enrique, I heard
about what happened.

735
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,706
Get away from me,
you Judas.

736
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,741
- Hey, I'm no Judas.
- Did you kill Martinez?

737
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,947
Did anybody in El Norte
kill Martinez?

738
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,580
No.

739
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,183
Then move the fuck away
from me. Muvate.

740
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,695
Everything okay,
here?

741
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,424
Can I have some juice?

742
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,033
Too bad about
your friend Martinez.

743
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,764
But he was a nasty man.

744
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,776
He deserved to die.

745
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,118
Yo.

746
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,559
I'm glad you came.

747
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,324
It's good
to see you too.

748
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,333
You look a shitload better than you did
the last time I was here.

749
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,767
You know, I hit a couple
of potholes, you know.

750
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,168
I'm cruising now, man,
70 miles an hour

751
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,299
with the fucking
top down, you know?

752
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,208
Speaking of which,
how's my car?

753
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,269
I don't know, bro.

754
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,713
What you mean you don't know?
When I got convicted

755
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,047
I gave you the keys,
told you to treat her like a lady.

756
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,917
I did, man. I fine-tuned her,
I polished her up, but...

757
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,117
Maritza gets out of Parker's,
bro, and she sells it.

758
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,215
What?

759
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,318
She said that car was
the cause of all her grief.

760
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,592
She didn't tell me nothing
about selling the car.

761
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,293
You seen her lately?

762
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,806
Oh, yeah.
I mean, all the time.

763
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,968
I mean, we live right across the street
from each other, remember?

764
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,602
Right.

765
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,943
I gotta ask you something.

766
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,280
I need you to tell me
the truth, okay?

767
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,554
- Is she fucking anyone?
- Oh, Miguel, man, l...

768
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,024
Yo, bro, bro,
I can feel it, man.

769
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,528
Okay?
I know she is.

770
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:01,360
Now, we've been like
brothers, man, a long time.

771
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,628
We ain't ever lied
about nothing.

772
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,260
You know,
I need to know.

773
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,904
Tell me, okay?
Who's the guy?

774
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,070
I don't...
I don't think you...

775
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,439
Bro,

776
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,678
- tell me, who's the guy?
- Me.

777
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,251
It's me.
Look, I'm sorry, Miguel.

778
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,917
Man, I got
no excuses, bro.

779
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,892
What happened,
it just happened.

780
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,725
You cocksucker.

781
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,664
You gonna hit me?
Go ahead, hit me, come on.

782
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:41,199
Okay, Alvarez,
time's up. Let's go.

783
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:52,412
Now that I know
the truth about Maritza,

784
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,885
in a fucked-up way,

785
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,910
I feel better,

786
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,889
you know?

787
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,914
I mean,
just the not knowing

788
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,291
was totally
eating me alive.

789
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,422
I'm surprised
about two things.

790
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,899
I haven't cried,

791
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,734
and I didn't pound
the shit out of Reynaldo.

792
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,003
That's a good thing,
right?

793
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,408
I mean, everything happens
for the best.

794
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,204
Right?

795
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,280
I wanted to kill him.

796
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,553
But I didn't.

797
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,000
So, I don't know,
I'm making progress.

798
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,205
So, what's next,
microchips in the brain?

799
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,541
The ability to read
each other's minds?

800
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,376
Too late.

801
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,645
A primitive tribe
in the other Oz...

802
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:04,142
Australia...
already beat us to it.

803
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,624
They talk by not talking.

804
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,990
Yeah, they're way
way ahead of us

805
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,619
in the realm
of communications

806
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,029
and they didn't have to
invent squat to get there.

807
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,033
They stayed connected

808
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,059
in the original sense,

809
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,436
in the aboriginal sense.

810
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,647
I'm done.

811
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,948
Which means
you're done too.

812
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,386
Now go get me a towel.

813
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,226
Hey, Robson.

814
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,801
- How's that bitch thing coming?
- Get away from me.

815
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,833
Listen, the only people
who hate Cutler more than you

816
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,778
is us.

817
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,179
So, why not do
everybody a favor?

818
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,705
Ace him?

819
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,217
Ain't no downside.

820
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,482
It proves to the brotherhood
you're still a man.

821
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,012
And it'll make you a lot
of friends in the kitchen.

822
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,048
Win-win.

823
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,729
"I'll go no more.

824
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,930
I am afraid to think
what I have done.

825
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,769
Look on't again
I dare not."

826
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,332
"Infirm of purpose.

827
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,311
Give me the daggers.

828
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:38,872
- The sleeping and the dead..."
- Hang on, stop stop.

829
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,544
I don't fucking get this.

830
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,416
What's confusing you,
Wolfgang?

831
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,047
- Well, I just killed the king, right?
- Right.

832
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,523
I come downstairs
with these bloody daggers

833
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,322
and now I'm like
a complete pussy.

834
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:55,195
Hmm, well, see...

835
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,995
Macbeth is conflicted

836
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,002
about the implications
of his act.

837
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:02,062
And I'm supposed to let this bitch
take care of things for me?

838
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,539
- You can't seem to do it yourself.
- Watch it, buttercup.

839
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,474
Uh, um...

840
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,741
could you just take a look
at the last line of the scene?

841
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,183
"To know my deed, 'twere best not
know myself."

842
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,650
And what does
that mean to you?

843
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,119
Why don't you just tell me?

844
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,019
That you would hate yourself

845
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,024
if you ever thought about
the things you've done.

846
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,856
Like I said,
Macbeth's a pussy.

847
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,454
Dont fuckin' move!

848
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,042
Take that shit off
your fucking head.

849
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,849
So you like that,
Prag?

850
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,423
You know what
we should try?

851
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,959
"We should try"?

852
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,167
When did I start giving a shit
about your input around here?

853
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,904
- B.C.P.
- What the fuck is that?

854
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,344
Breath control play.

855
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,508
First you make
a noose, see?

856
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,780
- Keep talking.
- Then you put it around your neck.

857
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,411
My neck?

858
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,445
Are you fucking
kidding me?

859
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,754
No, hear me out.

860
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,783
You put the noose
around your neck

861
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,728
and you hang
yourself lightly.

862
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,961
And all the blood
from your head

863
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,491
rushes straight
to your dick,

864
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,004
and then I blow you.

865
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,037
When you get off,

866
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:50,740
it's like God himself
is swallowing.

867
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,507
So, where's the noose?

868
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,047
Who would have thought those
things would have so many uses?

869
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,730
I was telling you
that shit about my dad.

870
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:13,964
Well, in many ways
I've become him.

871
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,973
I mean, I've done shit to guys
that I'm not proud of.

872
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,600
But in other ways,

873
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:25,047
I'm still that little boy
getting fucked in the shed.

874
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,312
Is someone
sodomizing you, James?

875
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,148
Wolfgang Cutler.

876
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,084
Here I am again,
shacked up with a psychopath.

877
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:42,090
But I'm older now,

878
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,623
seeing it
with different eyes.

879
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,628
What are you seeing?

880
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,573
In Cutler?

881
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,908
A guy who deep down
is really depressed,

882
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,143
really hates himself.

883
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,947
It's how his gaze
goes totally blank

884
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,716
while he's...

885
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,619
well, I think
he'd be happier dead.

886
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,362
And the thing is

887
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,096
sometimes his mood
goes so dark,

888
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,799
I think
he may do himself.

889
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,706
- Has he talked about suicide?
- No.

890
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,870
But with all
this "Macbeth" shit,

891
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,745
it's really fucked him up.

892
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,375
Sister,

893
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:38,319
maybe you could
talk to him, huh?

894
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,483
Before he does something
terrible to himself.

895
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,431
Wolfgang, I requested
a session with you,

896
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,561
but since it was supposed
to have started 40 minutes ago,

897
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,264
I guess you're not
showing up.

898
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,866
You and me got nothing
to talk about, Sis.

899
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,377
I'm not crazy.

900
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,380
Crazy is not the only reason
folks come to see me.

901
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,348
Shrinks are for fags.

902
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,908
Wolfgang,
you don't have to...

903
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,285
- Listen, bitch.
- Problem, Sister?

904
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,984
No.

905
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,393
Never mind.

906
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,942
Oh, morning, Wolfie.

907
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:45,284
Jeez, I guess I forgot
to untie you last night.

908
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,261
Holy shit.

909
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,424
Officer.

910
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,457
Officer!

911
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,031
Base one,
we got an 823 in B.

912
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,944
Well,
ain't that a kick?

913
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,916
One of you actually went
and lynched yourselves.

914
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,362
When man goes
collectively mad

915
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:31,959
from downloading all
the mental messages in the air,

916
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,402
when there's no trees left

917
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,338
'cause we needed all that paper
for the printing press

918
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,899
and therefore are left
with no oxygen to breathe,

919
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,037
then satellites will fry
from overuse

920
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,048
and drop from the sky.

921
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:49,381
And we'll make desperate
cell phone calls

922
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,114
to our loved ones

923
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:55,921
while watching Mother Earth's
last days on reality TV.

924
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,156
Communications
will be once again

925
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,686
what it was
in the beginning.

926
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,996
The word moving over
the face of the deep,

927
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,026
over the face of God,

928
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,005
Who now, instead
of wanting to talk,

929
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,508
is tired of listening.
