1
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,723
Oz, the name
on the street

2
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,096
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

3
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,896
Level Four.

4
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,732
Yeah, it's me.

5
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,897
You thought I was dead,
didn't you?

6
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,429
Well I am,

7
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,669
but that don't mean
I can't keep jawing.

8
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,643
And now that
I crossed over,

9
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,976
I got a whole new
perspective on things.

10
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,642
And I'm seeing a lot
of familiar faces.

11
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,622
- Fuck!
- Chill the fuck out.

12
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,923
Yeah, this ain't so bad.
Let me tell you,

13
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,520
dying is a lot harder
on the living

14
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,531
than it is
on the dead.

15
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,194
Death really only
hurts those left behind.

16
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,754
- Tim, what are you doing?
- Hey, come here.

17
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,086
What do you think?

18
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,493
What are you, Picasso?

19
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,022
No, it's not art, it's a maze.
It's a meditative maze.

20
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,057
Oh, okay.

21
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,570
What's a meditative maze?

22
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,505
Well, if you got
a problem

23
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,702
that you're trying
to figure out,

24
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,543
you enter the maze.

25
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,176
And as you make
your way through,

26
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,449
you concentrate on finding
the right path,

27
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,547
which stimulates
your powers of reason.

28
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,581
And by the time
you reach the end,

29
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,025
hopefully you'll have
figured the problem out.

30
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,688
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

31
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,856
You went to that New Age
seminar last weekend.

32
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:23,198
Yeah, so many people have died
since I set up Em City,

33
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:27,366
I was beginning to feel
anesthetized, you know?

34
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,205
But Augustus Hill...

35
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,007
boy, that rocked me.

36
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,844
I don't know.
A maze is kind of dumb,

37
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,215
but who's to say, right?
I mean, if it works...

38
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,550
we gotta try it, right?

39
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,112
Sure, Tim, only...

40
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,181
you know,
without real walls,

41
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,787
these dinks are just gonna
step over the line.

42
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,798
After Augustus died

43
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:56,097
and we cleaned out
his footlocker,

44
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,104
I found this box.

45
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,368
Now, written
on the lid is

46
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,844
"Do not open
until six months after my death."

47
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,678
So I decided
to respect his wishes.

48
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,877
This morning,
six months exactly,

49
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,886
I looked inside.

50
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,651
And?

51
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,790
"I am having a premonition
that today is the last day of my life.

52
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,993
Or maybe it is not
a premonition.

53
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,332
In Oz, every day is
potentially the last one.

54
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,398
Anyway, I'm taking the precaution
of sealing up this box.

55
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:40,378
Inside, you... and by that
I mean McManus, Burr and Said...

56
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,543
...will find a manuscript which I've
been writing over the past six years.

57
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,644
If you're perusing this letter,
then my premonition was right,

58
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,212
and I am dead.

59
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,248
So consider these pages
my last will and testament.

60
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,691
My will to survive.

61
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,132
My testament to all
I've experienced in Oz.

62
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,795
I ask you
to read my memories

63
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,135
and then do with them
whatever you think is right."

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,517
- Burr.
- I don't want any fucking part of this.

65
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,662
Hey, Baba.

66
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,639
Welcome back, Chucky.
You look good, all healthy and shit.

67
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,300
I guess I was
pretty close to death,

68
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,072
but Dr. Nathan,
she pulled me through.

69
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,080
- What's the latest?
- The tits are flowing free and easy,

70
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,582
especially now
that the niggers are out of the game.

71
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,050
Augustus Hill's death
really shattered them.

72
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,281
- Redding too?
- I don't understand the man.

73
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,721
Frankie Urbano goes
to stab Redding, kills Hill,

74
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,157
but Redding hasn't even
tried to retaliate.

75
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,457
Redding's plotting something,
that's for sure.

76
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,292
Yeah, but what?

77
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,838
Kill Whitey!

78
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,509
Fuck you, motherfucker!

79
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,825
Okay, let's break it up.
There's nothing to see here.

80
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,191
It's over, move on.

81
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,788
Redding, are you
watching this?

82
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,889
Redding!

83
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,803
While you weeping and a-wailing,
your men are out of control.

84
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,968
They're upset
over losing Augustus,

85
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,446
- what do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to take charge.

86
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,414
Oh, Jeez, Kareem,

87
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,146
I'd have thought you'd be glad
to see me sit in the back seat...

88
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,623
give you an opportunity
to convert all my boys to Islam.

89
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,149
Yeah, well, there are some
who will never find God,

90
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,322
nonetheless,
they need a leader.

91
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,730
And you are
their leader.

92
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,395
But right now
you do not truly lead.

93
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,667
You sit in here
mourning Augustus,

94
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,832
as well you should,

95
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,503
and you blame yourself,
as well you should.

96
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:29,504
But what's the difference, unless
your emotions are backed by action?

97
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,781
If Augustus' murder was truly due
to him slinging drugs

98
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,551
and you say you "do not want to see
any more young men die"...

99
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,855
fine. Drag your men
away from the drugs.

100
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,385
- How?
- I don't know.

101
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,398
The answer lies
within you.

102
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,663
When you find it,
it is then that you will finally

103
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,398
completely be a leader.

104
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,838
Till then you're just
a waste of space.

105
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,623
Hey, I want to talk to you
about what happens after death...

106
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,353
the afterlife.

107
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,918
See, the ancient Greeks
believed when a brother died,

108
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,623
he just got on a boat,

109
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,224
crossed the river Styx and went
to a place called Hades.

110
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,531
Now everybody
went to Hades.

111
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,436
It didn't matter how good
or how bad you were.

112
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,804
It's a place we all
just got our groove on.

113
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,900
But the Greeks,
they understood.

114
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,808
Just having lived,

115
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,337
just having gone through
the sheer shit of getting up

116
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,512
and going through a whole day
was enough to earn eternal reward.

117
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,117
Good morning, boys.

118
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,216
Today's the big day.

119
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,285
All you yokels get
to whine and snivel

120
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,819
in front of
the review boards

121
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,459
in hopes that we'll
let you out of solitary.

122
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:33,063
Though God knows why you'd
wanna leave this paradise.

123
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,804
My man McManus,
he gonna vouch for me.

124
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,503
He's gonna save me,
you know.

125
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,341
I'd say my chances
are 50-50.

126
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,609
Glynn's a fuckhead.

127
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,139
That motherfucker's
never gonna let me out.

128
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,381
You'll cast your vote for me,
won't you, Officer Howell?

129
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,322
I'll suck your
big fat hole!

130
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,915
Where's breakfast?
Breakfast!

131
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,728
What the fuck
you looking at, Martinez?

132
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,288
- You.
- Step back.

133
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,801
Make me.

134
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,606
How did you know
I was in the mood

135
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,733
for a little Mexican food?

136
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,869
- I'm Puerto Rican.
- Same difference.

137
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,573
Strip.

138
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,725
Oh, Martinez
is fucking Howell.

139
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,993
- He's fucking her again?
- He must need to make a phone call.

140
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,795
Damn.

141
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,927
As you know,
the time has come

142
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,563
for our biannual review
of the prisoners in solitary,

143
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,334
which I hate
to admit is S.R.O.,

144
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,434
so we either need to let
some of these dinks back into gen pop

145
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,037
or ship their butts
to another correctional facility.

146
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,445
Who's first?

147
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,847
Henry Stanton.

148
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,341
He's in solitary for stabbing
Martin Montgomery in the neck.

149
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,854
Ain't talkin' no more!

150
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,379
Montgomery
didn't even die.

151
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,255
He just can't
sing anymore.

152
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,954
Next?

153
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,396
Vern Schillinger
for raping Franklin Winthrop

154
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,161
and Adam Guenzel.

155
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,567
I'm telling you, the sex
was consensual. Ask Winthrop.

156
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,700
Miguel Alvarez. He smacked
a member of the parole board.

157
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,404
I guess I got
my hopes up too high.

158
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,107
I'm not gonna
do that again.

159
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,083
- Omar White, he, uh...
- Omar strangled an Aryan.

160
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,575
- Motherfucker!
- And then he saved the guy's life.

161
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,160
Next.

162
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,793
Greg Penders,

163
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,863
trained his seeing-eye mutt
to attack Officer Lopresti.

164
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,501
Lopresti's fine,
not a scratch on him.

165
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:56,546
Carlos Martinez threw a cocktail
in Dave Brass's face.

166
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,210
- Motherfucker!
- Yeah, and as a result

167
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,412
the C.O. S beat the shit
out of Martinez.

168
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,417
Martinez is scum. We definitely
should not let him out of solitary.

169
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,124
He and Penders
both attacked C.O.s.

170
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,223
I won't let either of them
back into gen pop.

171
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,325
Any recommendations
regarding the others?

172
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,199
Stanton and Schillinger could go.

173
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,398
Schillinger? No way.

174
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,532
If he's free, he'll do
something to screw up

175
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,908
- Tobias Beecher's parole hearing.
- Miguel Alvarez.

176
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,812
I want him in Em City.
Leo, he's trying to change.

177
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,214
So is Omar White,
I don't hear you begging for him.

178
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,115
I can help Alvarez.

179
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,780
I can't do any more for Omar
than I've already done.

180
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,949
Fuck.

181
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,652
Hey, Omar!

182
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,253
You and me get to spend
a little quality time together.

183
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,093
What... what are you
squawking about?

184
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,465
McManus has left you here
in my warm embrace.

185
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,027
No no, wait. Let me
talk to him, please?

186
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,130
If I help you, what'll
you do for me in return?

187
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,301
- I don't know.
- Shine my shoes?

188
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:01,575
No, l-l... I ain't
no Pullman porter.

189
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,774
- Strip.
- Well, uh...

190
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,083
Look...

191
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,053
I, uh...

192
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,390
I ain't been feeling
to good lately, you know?

193
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,019
Strip.

194
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,295
Hurry,
I have lunch plans.

195
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,971
- Ugh!
- I told you I was sick.

196
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,568
You know what?

197
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,707
Today, you are
the shoeshine boy!

198
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,377
Ugh! Man!

199
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,456
I'm just coughing up
all kinds of colors and shit.

200
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,957
My-my... my piss is
like it's on fire.

201
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,021
Any night sweats?
Trouble sleeping?

202
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,260
- Huh-uh.
- Mmm.

203
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,429
- I'd better admit him.
- Why, what's wrong with him?

204
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,268
I'm not sure.
I'll do some tests.

205
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,534
If it turns out
you're faking, dickwad,

206
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,103
I'm gonna eat your balls
for breakfast.

207
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,921
By a vote of four to three,
we've decided

208
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:20,085
- to release you from solitary.
- You're shitting me?

209
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,593
No, Miguel. You're coming back
to Emerald City.

210
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,028
McManus put himself
on the line for you, Alvarez.

211
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,033
Don't fuck him over
with more of your nonsense.

212
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,035
My nonsense, no.

213
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,401
I got enemies,
I can't control their nonsense.

214
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,919
Enough! Stop!

215
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:02,460
So... what was that little scuffle
with Torres about?

216
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,867
I don't know.
He's crazy.

217
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,338
Okay, Chico.

218
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,137
You know, I've been doing
some sniffing around,

219
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,700
and I've been able to piece
together some information

220
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,736
I thought you'd find
sort of interesting.

221
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,714
It's about Miguel Alvarez.

222
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,240
Every problem he's had
for the past five years or so

223
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,719
- is somehow tied to you.
- Me? No.

224
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,655
So I'm telling you this:
If Miguel has anymore difficulties,

225
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,385
I'm gonna be looking
to blame you.

226
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,087
And now that we got a lot
of free space in solitary,

227
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,358
my first reaction
to any trouble

228
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,922
- will be to ship your ass there...
- Wait a minute!

229
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,935
- Unless you become
Alvarez's new best friend.

230
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,630
Miguel.

231
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,969
We were just
talking about you.

232
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,133
Guerra's got something
to say to you.

233
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,842
Yeah.

234
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,515
You know...

235
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,783
you and me,
we started out as friends,

236
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,888
and even though a whole lot of shit
has come down since then...

237
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,699
I'm thinking maybe
we could... you know.

238
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,971
Yeah, Chico.

239
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,153
Shake hands.

240
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,644
Lights out.
Sweet dreams.

241
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,351
I saw you and Alvarez
making nice.

242
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,862
- Were you serious?
- The truth?

243
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,798
I don't know. I've hated his guts
for so many years,

244
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,097
now I can't even
remember why.

245
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,264
And today I almost
got my throat cut.

246
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,466
That started me
thinking.

247
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,140
Enrique, you ever feel like
you've lost your appetite

248
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,704
- for all the bullshit?
- Yeah,

249
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,478
when my sister died
in that bus accident.

250
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,420
That's right. You were talking
peace and patience back then.

251
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,787
- What happened?
- Oz.

252
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,725
Oz is what happened.

253
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,887
Fucking Oz.

254
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,549
Now the Italians,
they got a whole 'nother way

255
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,450
of thinking about
life after death.

256
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,785
This Dante dude
describes Hell

257
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,724
as a series of little circles
where sinners are tormented

258
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,193
by the punishment
that reflects their crime.

259
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,095
Flatterers are buried up
to their necks in shit.

260
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,395
Lawyers wear clothes
that never stop itching.

261
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,060
Just think on it.

262
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,002
What would be
the one thing

263
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,733
that would torture you
for all of eternity?

264
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,604
Your mother-in-law?

265
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,905
Britney Spears' singing?

266
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,744
For me, it'd be
a big pair of tits

267
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,944
just hanging
out of my reach.

268
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,781
Damn!

269
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,949
Count!

270
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,328
Morning, Bob.

271
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,731
Bob? You feeling
any better?

272
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,681
Hmm.

273
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,048
Redding, Burr,

274
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,111
#01R289.

275
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,089
Rebadow, Robert,

276
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,559
#65R814.

277
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,561
Busmalis,
where's Rebadow?

278
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,199
Grief's like a wave.
You've gotta ride it out.

279
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:34,296
And as badly
as you feel now, I can tell you,

280
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,399
you're in better shape than you were
the day your grandson died.

281
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,205
That's hard
for me to accept

282
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,044
because the sadness
I feel keeps morphing.

283
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:47,450
This morning... or should I say
last night since I barely sleep...

284
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,976
I became...

285
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,956
consumed with the fact that
the Rebadow name will die.

286
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,889
I was the only son,
my son is my only child,

287
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,295
his son was
his only child.

288
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,461
After we're gone, the family
will become extinct

289
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,938
like some species of insect
destroyed by pollution.

290
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,872
My pollution.

291
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,602
I don't know why
we have such a thing

292
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,633
about passing
on our names,

293
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,976
as if that somehow
justifies our existence.

294
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,777
My grandson's illness
filled up so much of my time,

295
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,511
so much of my heart.

296
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,644
His death has left
an emptiness.

297
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,054
You need to keep busy.
You know, focus on your job.

298
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,820
You like working
in the dress factory, don't you?

299
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,690
No, not at all.

300
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,696
The thought of hearing
the hideous hum

301
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,595
of those machines
day in and day out...

302
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,259
Okay, I'll transfer you.

303
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,632
Where would you prefer
to punch the clock?

304
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,866
I'm not...

305
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,171
I love to read.
The library?

306
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,778
So that's what's allocated
in the current budget.

307
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,512
- Can you get more?
- I can try.

308
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,418
- Leo?
- Tim.

309
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,390
Meet the new head librarian
Stella Coffo. Tim McManus.

310
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,823
- Hello.
- Hi.

311
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,759
I heard you two
were having a meeting.

312
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,785
Stella comes
to us from Boston

313
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,698
where she worked in the public library
system for 16 years.

314
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,170
Yeah, I gotta admit I'm a little curious
as to why you're here.

315
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,468
You mean why leave
the comfort of Boston

316
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,406
for the wilds
of Oswald?

317
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,807
Well, it's simple.
I love to read.

318
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,972
And if I can get the men
in this prison to pick up a book,

319
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,381
maybe their lives will be
changed in some small way.

320
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,181
Admirable goal.
Tough task.

321
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,120
Well, I'm from the North End.

322
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,180
To me "no" only means
"try harder."

323
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,454
Oh, good.
Um, look...

324
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,961
l... I hate to do this
on your first day,

325
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,294
- but I need a favor.
- Sure, anything.

326
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,233
There's a prisoner
named Rebadow.

327
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,333
Here goes.

328
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,605
Well, first in line.

329
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,912
I guess you heard
the John Grisham finally arrived.

330
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,918
Oh, I don't read
that tripe.

331
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,443
Sorry, I didn't mean
to offend you.

332
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,084
- You Mrs. Coffo?
- Ms. Coffo, actually.

333
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,492
Name's Rebadow.

334
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,997
I've been assigned
to work with you.

335
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,465
But I'm no acolyte.

336
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,094
I know where every decimal
in the Dewey System is.

337
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,969
Ask me which shelf a book
is on, I'll point to it.

338
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,737
Excellent. I should
warn you though,

339
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,506
I'm not gonna sit on my ass
and wait for the men to come to me.

340
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,038
I want to identify the ones
who have no interest in reading,

341
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,210
the ones who maybe don't
even know how to read.

342
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,118
I want to put a book
in their hands,

343
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,054
and finding
the right book is the key.

344
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,751
That's where
I'm gonna lean on you.

345
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,816
You have
my full support.

346
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,159
Do you have a first name,
Mr. Rebadow?

347
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,028
Robert,

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,296
though most of the jokers
in Oz call me Bob.

349
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,133
Well, I'll call you Robert then,
and you can call me Stella.

350
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,731
I'm very pleased
to have you on board.

351
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,908
Hey, Cyril, we're meeting
with your new lawyer today,

352
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,181
some big hotshot
that Meehan found.

353
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,656
- Can I come with you now?
- No, not yet, but soon, all right?

354
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,784
You sound awful
optimistic there, O'Reily.

355
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,386
I'm trying, Keller,
but optimism isn't exactly my...

356
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,590
what's the word
I'm looking for? Forte?

357
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,158
- Yo, can I get some fucking food?
- Eat that, you hairy bitch.

358
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,959
Hey, everyone,

359
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,767
meet the new member
of our clubhouse.

360
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,797
Kirk,
you fucking cocksucker!

361
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,071
You should be dead,
you little fucking prick!

362
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,204
Don't be angry, Jaz-man.
It's not your fault that I'm alive.

363
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,272
The truth is,
I can't die.

364
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,545
Bullshit.
Just give me another chance.

365
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,148
It won't do any good.
I can't die.

366
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,986
Yeah, why is that,
pumpkin?

367
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,754
Because...
I am Satan.

368
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,262
And Satan
will never die.

369
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,762
- Good morning, Pete.
- Ray.

370
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,709
Oh, boy.
I'm so glad you're back.

371
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,474
Thank you.
I would say I'm happy to be back,

372
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,572
but I'm not sure yet.

373
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,680
There's something
you should know.

374
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,982
Timothy Kirk has been
transferred to death row,

375
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,579
and he's asked
to see you.

376
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,251
- No chance.
- All right, now look...

377
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,285
Pete, two of the priests
from my parish

378
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,229
were burned alive
in that fire,

379
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,791
a fire that Kirk arranged
and paid for out of spite and malice.

380
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,826
In a few weeks
he's going to be executed.

381
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,963
He may need to make
peace with you.

382
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,839
- His soul...
- His soul will rot in hell.

383
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,969
Ray, only God
can decide that.

384
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,553
Uh-oh,
Holy Ghost on deck.

385
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,056
- Say hello, Jericho.
- Hello, Father.

386
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,855
Yo, Mukada.

387
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,158
Look at that fucking
jizzball sitting there.

388
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,097
I'm gonna fucking
kill you, cocksucker!

389
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,332
- Thank you so much for the meeting.
- Don't get used to it.

390
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,430
I have to talk fast
before he comes back.

391
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,340
- Who, Lopresti?
- Satan.

392
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,708
Father, look.

393
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,508
I know
that you hate me

394
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,175
and I know that I've committed
all these horrible acts,

395
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,776
but it's not me
who's done them.

396
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,652
I am possessed
by the Devil.

397
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,622
- Stop.
- I am possessed,

398
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,558
and you are the only one
who can help me.

399
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,187
- I need an exorcism.
- I said stop.

400
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,164
Do you think I can't see through
this little performance?

401
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,168
What, are you trying for an insanity
defense on your appeal?

402
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:41,434
No. Father, please.
He's coming!

403
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,737
By even suggesting
what you're suggesting,

404
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,211
you make a mockery
of my religion.

405
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,042
Goodbye, Kirk.

406
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,605
I'll see you
the day you die.

407
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,478
Mukada!

408
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,387
You can walk away,

409
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,859
but I'm not like
the Reverend Cloutier.

410
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,794
I won't just disappear.

411
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,768
We work
with criminals.

412
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,570
We try to understand
the reasons

413
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,009
why they broke the law
so we can help them.

414
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,311
We examine the psychological
elements, the sociological.

415
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,317
We consider
their family backgrounds,

416
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,979
environments, addictions,
blah blah blah.

417
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,512
Usually there's an answer
if not a cure.

418
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,924
But sometimes
we come face to face

419
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,623
with a larger,
more stunning reality.

420
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:43,293
We come face to face
with pure evil,

421
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,860
and we are powerless.

422
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,134
I believe that Kirk has
no hope for salvation.

423
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,665
He is pure evil.

424
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,440
I don't disagree
that there's evil in the world.

425
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,607
I do disagree that
we're powerless against it.

426
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,380
Ray, you and I have
dedicated our lives

427
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,980
to overcoming evil
through love.

428
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,014
God's love.

429
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,290
Come in.

430
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,126
- Hello, Ray.
- Oh, Monsignor.

431
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,427
Sister Peter Marie,
this is Monsignor Slon,

432
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,993
- Vicar-General of the Archdiocese.
- How do you do?

433
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,597
Nice to meet you, Sister.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

434
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,574
but this is a matter
of some importance.

435
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,803
Well, I have a session.
A pleasure.

436
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,274
Can I get you
some tea or...

437
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,251
- No, thanks. Let's sit.
- Sure.

438
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,550
How's Cardinal Abgott?

439
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,321
Troubled, and that's
why I've come.

440
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,488
His Eminence received
a letter yesterday

441
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,466
from a prisoner here
at Oswald, Timothy Kirk.

442
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,799
Monsignor, you've got to understand,
there's a lot of history

443
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,897
- between Kirk and me.
- So it seems.

444
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,036
Ray, Kirk claims you
sexually abused him.

445
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,104
- What?
- These are dicey times,

446
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:07,244
and even though Kirk
is no parochial schoolboy,

447
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,686
the church can't afford...
either spiritually or financially...

448
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,350
to have any more
of our priests be suspect.

449
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,225
- Monsignor, Kirk is lying.
- I believe you,

450
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,127
so does the Cardinal,

451
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,860
but if Kirk goes public
with his accusations

452
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,266
we have to be ready.
Which is why,

453
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,532
until we investigate,
I'm suspending you.

454
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,801
We'll handle
the investigation

455
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,570
as quickly as possible,
but as of this moment

456
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,804
you are no longer
allowed to perform

457
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,473
any functions as
a Catholic priest.

458
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,246
I'm sorry, Ray.

459
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,929
Pure evil.

460
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,115
I was very happy
with the variety show you put together,

461
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,679
and I'm hoping you'll
produce another one.

462
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,350
Oh, thank you, Leo.

463
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,258
Actually, I'd really like to do
more with the prisoners

464
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:27,025
than just singing and dancing,
so I was thinking Shakespeare...

465
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,329
- "Macbeth."
- Sounds great.

466
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,834
- Yes.
- Sounds expensive.

467
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,394
Not necessarily,
because we would do the production

468
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,497
in modern dress
with minimal scenery,

469
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,667
and that way the play
will be more accessible.

470
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,145
- Can you work up a budget?
- As a matter of fact...

471
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,477
we have one here.

472
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,177
Leo, I don't want this
to get bogged down in bureaucracy.

473
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,651
I'd like to start next week,
holding auditions

474
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,483
and putting
together a crew.

475
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,685
The hardest part's gonna be
getting these jamokes to participate.

476
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,057
And that's why
we are so lucky

477
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,324
that we have you
for the motivation, Tim.

478
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,559
We're not looking
for Denzel Washington here.

479
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,694
The point is to give you a place
to channel your emotions

480
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,932
other than fighting
or heroin,

481
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,702
and not everyone has to be
in front of the footlights.

482
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,903
Suzanne needs
a stage manager,

483
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,812
lighting, props, scenery,
the whole enchilada.

484
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,248
So I expect a strong representation
from Em City.

485
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,343
Get involved.

486
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:26,379
- Chucky, what about you?
- Plays are for fags.

487
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,325
Miguel, Miguel.

488
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,329
Come on, this is a chance
to show everybody the new you.

489
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,662
No, I think I'd be a little embarrassed,
being in front of people.

490
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,497
So, be a stage manager.

491
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,527
- What the fuck do they do?
- Boss everyone else around.

492
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,030
Really?
All right, I'm in.

493
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,906
Okay, good.

494
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,969
Hey, how about props?

495
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,072
"Here I have
a pilot's thumb,

496
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,983
Wreck'd as homeward
he did come."

497
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,852
- That's very good, Poet.
- What the fuck am I saying?

498
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,760
You are telling your friends
how you destroyed your enemy.

499
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,922
- Really?
- Yeah.

500
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,932
A'ight.

501
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,264
So in the real play
can I get a real thumb?

502
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,462
You got anybody in mind?

503
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,529
- Maybe yours, cheeseball.
- What'd you say, cum stain?

504
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,598
- What?
- Hey hey, settle the fuck down!

505
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,903
How goes it, Ma?

506
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,675
If I could keep them
from killing each other.

507
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,706
I think I've got all my actors,
except for Macbeth,

508
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,911
- so I was thinking, Ryan...
- Sorry.

509
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,944
- You'd be brilliant in the part.
- I love you, Ma, but no way.

510
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,786
You got no balls, Whitey?

511
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,587
I don't see you strutting
your stuff there, Pepe.

512
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,289
- Dick.
- Oh, come on, Ryan, it could be fun.

513
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,957
I did the part once
at the C.Y.O.

514
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,990
Let's see now.
"Stay...

515
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:47,630
you imperfect speakers,
and tell me more;

516
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,403
By Sinel's death
I am Thane of Glamis;

517
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,377
But how of Cawdor?

518
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:59,179
The Thane of Cawdor lives,
a prosperous gentleman;

519
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,449
and to be king stands
not within the prospect of belief,

520
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,821
Say from whence you owe

521
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:10,157
this strange intelligence?

522
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,992
Speak, I charge you!"

523
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,865
Father Meehan,
that was excellent!

524
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,336
Now how would you
like to play Macbeth?

525
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,033
- Me?
- Yeah.

526
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,701
Lights out.

527
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,334
Nighty-night, boys.

528
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,843
- Amen.
- Well, it's about time.

529
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,618
Ah, the power of prayer
is a wonderful thing, Ryan.

530
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,124
When I was a kid
I'd bend my knees

531
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,184
and ask God to stop Dad
from beating on us.

532
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,888
God never answered
his pager.

533
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,295
A prayer's more than
asking for something.

534
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,301
It centers you,
gives you peace of mind.

535
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,303
Pray with me.

536
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,068
No, I figure between you, Sister Pete
and Aunt Brenda, I'm covered.

537
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,338
It would give me
profound joy

538
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,210
if someday you would
join me in prayer.

539
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,374
Well, it would give me profound joy
to fuck an 18-year-old virgin,

540
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,375
- so save your lungs, okay, Father?
- Naughty.

541
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,727
What you have to remember
is that this is about power.

542
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,393
You cannot let
these people

543
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:27,871
take your power
away from you.

544
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,066
Remember, Cyril,

545
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:35,045
you are the center
of the universe.

546
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,174
What the fuck
you looking at?

547
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:59,095
- So you're the new lawyer?
- Arnold Zelman.

548
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,231
You want to explain to me why
my brother's still sitting on death row?

549
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,207
Eight months ago,
the Supreme Court ruled

550
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,541
that executing the mentally retarded
was unconstitutional.

551
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:12,208
Each state has the right to determine
for itself how retarded is defined.

552
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,346
Our assemblymen have been squabbling
over a definition all this time.

553
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,480
Yesterday, they finally managed
to reach an agreement.

554
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,047
- Which is?
- Well, basically,

555
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,492
to qualify as retarded,
a person has to have demonstrated

556
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,497
some sign of retardation
before the age of 18.

557
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,490
18? But Cyril wasn't hit in the head
until his late 20s.

558
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,503
Well, that's why
he can still be executed.

559
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,471
Oh, fuck.

560
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,338
All right, so what
do we do next?

561
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,866
Appeal Cyril's conviction.
At the first trial,

562
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,176
the prosecution was able to make
the case that Cyril's attack on Li Chen

563
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,307
- was premeditated.
- Yeah, but it wasn't.

564
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,544
Well, in the appeal,
we have to prove it wasn't.

565
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,452
I'm going to start by re-interviewing
all of the witnesses.

566
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,978
Great.

567
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,117
Those fucks in Em City,
they got no reason to help me.

568
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,184
All we need
is one, Ryan.

569
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:08,666
Prisoner #99S917:
Glen Shupe;

570
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:30,158
convicted April 22nd, 1999;
manslaughter;

571
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:34,790
sentence: 15 years;
up for parole in eight.

572
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,926
Hey, Shupe,
you need a hand?

573
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:42,001
- Stay away from me!
- Aw, why you so testy, man?

574
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,666
It's because of you
I'm like this!

575
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,006
Uh-uh, no way, not me.
Spics chopped you up.

576
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,704
On your say-so.

577
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,770
- Hello, Mom.
- Oop...

578
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,147
Whether I did or didn't have
anything to do with your...

579
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,210
what's the word I'm looking for there,
Glen? "Disability."

580
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,313
Know this: A lawyer's gonna be
coming around

581
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,756
asking questions about the day
Li Chen got whacked

582
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,123
and unless you want to be
dialing with your nose,

583
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,561
you'd best tell him
what he wants to hear.

584
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,791
You got that,
you stupid bitch?

585
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,706
I'm here to talk about the day
Cyril O'Reily attacked Li Chen.

586
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,403
Now I know you've had
several conversations

587
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,638
with various
law enforcement officers,

588
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,273
prosecutors
and defense attorneys,

589
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,478
and I know you've testified
that you saw nothing

590
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,544
and know nothing of the circumstances
surrounding Li's death.

591
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,648
But since I only recently
jumped onto this case,

592
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,158
I'm hoping you may...

593
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,093
I know exactly
what happened.

594
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,528
You do?

595
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,829
Ryan and Li had a scuffle.
A knife fell to the floor...

596
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,528
probably Li's knife.

597
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,595
And Cyril stabbed Li
spontaneously

598
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,333
to save
his brother's life.

599
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,570
There was nothing premeditated
about Cyril's actions, nothing.

600
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,603
Mr. Shupe, have you talked
to anyone else recently

601
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,615
about these events?

602
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,879
I mean, has anyone
prepped you?

603
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,385
No, sir.

604
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,618
It's what I saw and I want
to testify to that in court.

605
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,524
Do you know that you can get
five more years for perjury?

606
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,085
Mr. Zelman,
I'm already serving 15.

607
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,619
I'm not afraid.

608
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,626
So how is it going
interviewing the witnesses?

609
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,465
So far, not so good.

610
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,165
- What about Shupe?
- He's not very credible.

611
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,470
Shupe is
a compulsive liar.

612
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,341
The irony is that this time
he's telling the truth.

613
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,539
- Well then use him.
- If I put Shupe on the stand,

614
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,310
the jury won't believe a word.
He'll do more damage than good.

615
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,978
So, you'll find
a credible witness.

616
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,078
I hope. I'm down
to my last few guys.

617
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,612
- What do we do next?
- Turn up the heat.

618
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,626
The press and public have
shown a keen interest in this case.

619
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,651
I'll use my contacts
at the networks...

620
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,667
Hey, Petey, you out
of the psych unit?

621
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,431
Did you work out
all your inner demons?

622
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,569
I heard something from a very reliable
source yesterday, O'Reily.

623
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,045
Oh, yeah?
What'd you hear?

624
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,174
That you ground up glass
and put it in my father's food,

625
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,583
cut his insides up slowly.

626
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,951
You're responsible
for my father being dead.

627
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,817
Well, what you heard is true...
except for one little detail.

628
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,953
Adebisi did the deed.
It wasn't me.

629
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:21,226
I was your father's friend.
Hey, who's your reliable source, huh?

630
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,823
Some nutjob
from the whack shack?

631
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,199
Never mind.
I tell you who he is, he's dead.

632
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,500
Fair enough.

633
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,905
But what if what you say is true?
Which it isn't.

634
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,273
What the fuck's
a little prag like you

635
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,745
gonna do about it
anyhow, huh?

636
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,304
Now back the fuck
away from me.

637
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,407
You stink like anchovies.

638
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,989
I have to admit
I'm stunned.

639
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,893
I've been trying for months
to get to you to visit your wife,

640
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,988
and now all of a sudden
you want to see her.

641
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,761
Well like I said, Sister,
I'm feeling better about myself

642
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,735
with you
and Father Meehan's help...

643
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,999
I had a long talk
with Rosalie yesterday.

644
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,438
But you didn't tell her
what happened to me, right?

645
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,274
No, I'm just gonna wait for you
to find the right time to tell her.

646
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:28,097
"A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come."

647
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,124
"The weird sisters,
hand in hand,

648
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,001
Posters of
the sea and land,

649
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,098
Thus do go about,
about:

650
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,305
Thrice to thine
and thrice to mine,

651
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,813
And thrice again
to make up nine.

652
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,009
Peace!

653
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,883
The charm's wound up!"

654
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:52,514
"So foul and fair a day
I have not seen."

655
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,581
"How far is't call'd
to Forres?"

656
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,322
All right, shut up!
Time's up.

657
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,057
But I barely
got a line out.

658
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,260
"Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow," Agamemnon.

659
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:09,402
Here comes another volunteer:
Mr. Peter Schibetta.

660
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,635
- Great. Hello, Peter.
- Hi.

661
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,870
Ryan could use some help
painting the scenery.

662
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,402
No, I don't need any help,
especially his.

663
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,251
I've seen this play in high school.
It's got all these incantations, right?

664
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,584
- Right.
- We Sicilians, we have our own version,

665
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,183
our own spells:
The Evil Eye.

666
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,752
My wife's grandmother, she can give
somebody the Evil Eye from a mile away.

667
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,890
I'm not saying the stuff works,
but who knows, right?

668
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,694
I thought I told you
to back the fuck away.

669
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,399
No problem, cuz.
No problem.

670
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,911
Ah, Ryan.

671
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:53,178
Look, I know you've done things
you're not particularly proud of,

672
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,617
but sometimes if you
talk things through...

673
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,315
Skip the preamble, Father,
what's on your mind?

674
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,449
All right.
Peter Schibetta.

675
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:05,360
I've seen the way you two
look at each other, the hostility.

676
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,330
Schibetta's
a cornhole.

677
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,891
For God's sake, Ryan,
will you knock off this bravado,

678
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,403
this-this...
this bullshit

679
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,371
just for a moment?

680
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,365
I know you think
you have to be hard to survive here,

681
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,847
but there are
other ways.

682
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,475
I've seen you
with your brother,

683
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,486
there's love,
there's caring,

684
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,250
there's goodness
in you.

685
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,484
Will you let
that goodness rise

686
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:38,518
and be the man that
God meant you to be?

687
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,099
- How, Father?
- I'll help you.

688
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,763
And we'll start
with your laundry.

689
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,898
Now you think
you'd know by now

690
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,070
that if you don't
separate your laundry,

691
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,045
the colors will bleed.

692
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,811
In the Shona Tribe
in Africa,

693
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,184
the living communicate
with Mwari...

694
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,688
that's God...

695
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,317
through their dead ancestors,
the Vadzimu.

696
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,385
The Shona believe that
all around the living

697
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,794
there's an invisible
community of Vadzimu

698
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,925
watching and caring for
their descendants.

699
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,492
But there's also Ngozi...

700
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,563
evil spirits,
the wronged,

701
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,540
the neglected,
the murdered...

702
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,634
who avenge themselves
on a family

703
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,474
through sudden death.

704
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,810
Oh, Christ.

705
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,251
Father!

706
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,923
Oh God, Father!

707
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,932
Father,
what's the matter?

708
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,163
Father!

709
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,534
Father!
Shit!

710
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,164
Help!
Help!

711
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,730
Help!

712
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,242
Come here, help!

713
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,836
Help!

714
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,369
Bring in
that crash cart!

715
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,783
Four, five... one, two,
three, four, five.

716
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,513
Get the incubation tray.

717
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,719
- How is he?
- Father Meehan's dead.

718
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,526
Oh, fuck.

719
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,500
An aneurysm.
He died almost immediately.

720
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,368
- How did it happen?
- Who knows?

721
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:30,373
I mean, we'll do an autopsy,
try to figure out the cause, but...

722
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,342
But he'll still
be dead, right?

723
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,709
And yet, of all the ways
he could have died in Oz,

724
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,772
God chose
the most peaceful.

725
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:42,115
Yeah, right! When I found
Father Meehan lying on the floor,

726
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,120
he'd taken a shit
in his underwear.

727
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,452
So what does that tell you
about us human beings?

728
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,890
The last thing we do
before we die is shit?

729
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,588
Ryan, have some
respect for the man.

730
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,359
I do!

731
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,595
You know, a couple
of Sundays ago at mass,

732
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,262
he read the part
of the Gospel

733
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,601
where after Jesus was
pulled off the cross

734
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,540
his friends took the body down
and they washed it.

735
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,237
I'd like to do that.

736
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:11,077
I'd like to wash
Father Meehan's body.

737
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,173
Ah, I don't know.

738
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,150
Please?

739
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,709
He wanted me to pray
with him, but I never did.

740
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,382
Despite all that he tried
to do for me and Cyril,

741
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,584
I owe the man
this much, please.

742
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:41,032
...as we forgive those who
trespass against us...

743
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,582
Gonna ruin your eyes
reading all that small print.

744
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,949
They're law books.

745
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,977
The small print's
the best part.

746
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,253
- Working on an appeal?
- Yeah.

747
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,351
Not for me,
for Chris Keller.

748
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,521
I'm trying to overturn
his death sentence.

749
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,428
I've got my dad working
on the case too.

750
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,194
You're a lawyer?

751
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,167
Used to be.

752
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,261
Mail Call!

753
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,770
What you got for me
there, Winthrop?

754
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,037
"Newsweek" and
"Field and Stream."

755
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,873
Where's my "Swank"?

756
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,210
It got a little manhandled
in the mailroom.

757
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,738
Hey there, Beecher.

758
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,047
Enjoying life
in Unit "J"?

759
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,383
It beats bobbing for apples
with the Aryans.

760
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,224
Yo, come on!
Break it up, break it up!

761
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,026
What'd you expect?
You got Schillinger sent to solitary.

762
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,699
For raping you.

763
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,629
I told you I can take care of myself.
I have plans.

764
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:20,302
What plans?

765
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,244
Have a nice visit
with your kids.

766
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,448
How'd you know
my kids were coming?

767
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,280
Winthrop!

768
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,584
In a vote
of six to one,

769
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,681
we've decided to
release you from solitary,

770
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,989
with the understanding that
if you attempt another rape,

771
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,222
you will be sent
back there permanently.

772
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,924
Let me guess.

773
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,923
Sister, you were
the one dissenting vote?

774
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,458
Take him to Unit "B."

775
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,712
That was nice, prag.

776
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,806
May... may I speak, sir?

777
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,717
Yeah well,
wipe your mouth first.

778
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,582
I come from
pure Aryan blood.

779
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,457
I have an education.

780
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,157
I can be of better use
to you than this.

781
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,928
- You want to join the Brotherhood?
- Yes.

782
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,834
That'd be unusual.

783
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,499
Usually a bitch
is a bitch is a bitch.

784
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,668
- I have a plan.
- That lvy League mind at work?

785
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,508
If Beecher gets hurt
before his parole hearing,

786
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,912
you go into solitary
forever, am I right?

787
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,541
Yeah.

788
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:37,076
Yet revenge on that scumfuck is all
you can ever think about, am I right?

789
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,850
- Your point?
- I'll kill Beecher's father.

790
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,983
- What?
- I'll cover my tracks,

791
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,483
pay off the C.O.s. And if I'm caught,
I'll take sole blame.

792
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,326
I can kill him.

793
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,764
I will kill him
if you promise me an upgrade.

794
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,992
Done.

795
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,811
My son Harry
is coming here today.

796
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,370
It's the first time
I'll be seeing him in six years.

797
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,405
Six years?

798
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,645
Yeah.
After my wife died,

799
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:11,415
my parents took the two oldest.
And Genevieve's parents,

800
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,083
they took Harry the baby
to live with them in San Diego.

801
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:17,150
Why haven't you
seen Harry in so long?

802
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,389
Everybody figured
it was for the best.

803
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,363
Horseshit.

804
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,922
A child belongs
with his father

805
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,695
even if his father
is behind bars.

806
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,398
- Hello, son.
- Dad.

807
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,608
- Where are the kids?
- I need to talk to you.

808
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,180
Guess I'll take a nap.
Wake me up for shuffleboard.

809
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,287
Genevieve's parents have been
staying with us for the past week.

810
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,257
Well, it was awkward
at first,

811
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:52,558
but Jonah and Margaret have been
working very hard to be...

812
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,496
well, to be
a family again,

813
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,159
to ease Harry back
into your life.

814
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,861
And?

815
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,426
Well, they're waiting
in the parking lot.

816
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,597
Harry won't get
out of the car.

817
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:16,616
Son, he's six years old.

818
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,883
He's terrified.

819
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,619
His crying
is upsetting Holly.

820
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,924
- It's okay, don't force him.
- We'll try again tomorrow.

821
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,361
No no, you know...

822
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,330
let's just
hold off, okay?

823
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,362
My parole hearing's
on Thursday.

824
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,806
If I get paroled,
I can see him at home.

825
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,470
Are you sure?

826
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,071
Yes, I can wait.

827
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,641
- It's just a couple more days.
- Right!

828
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,675
This time I know
the parole board

829
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,746
is going to let you out.
I know it!

830
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,122
In the bottom of my heart,
I know that you will be free.

831
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:07,068
So... tell me, how does
he look, my son?

832
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,504
Oh, well...

833
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,670
like his father.

834
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,747
He has his mother's eyes.

835
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,958
So you're going to see Chris
to talk about the appeal, right?

836
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,762
Yes.

837
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,603
Will you give him
my love?

838
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:54,144
Our current strategy is
to focus on the credibility

839
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,516
of the prosecution's
eyewitness, uh...

840
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,282
Jerry Heekin.

841
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,984
We've just discovered that
he'd been arrested twice

842
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,220
for dealing crack cocaine.

843
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:08,254
How come my other motherfucking
lawyer didn't know that?

844
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,529
Like the kids say,
he sucked.

845
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,173
Gotta calm down there,
Mr. Beecher.

846
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,441
- Gum?
- No, thank you.

847
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,279
- You don't like me, do you?
- That's beside the point.

848
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,685
I don't have to like you
to defend you.

849
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,689
- And my son...
- Loves me.

850
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,850
That bother you?

851
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,695
Yes.

852
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,027
That he loves a man
or that he loves me?

853
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,760
We're finished
for the day.

854
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,894
Your Honor, please instruct
the witness to answer the question.

855
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,427
All right.

856
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,407
I find you despicable.

857
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,671
Happy?

858
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,649
Just another notch
in my gun.

859
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,620
The trial of
Mayor Wilson Loewen

860
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,282
continued today at the Bankhead
State Courthouse.

861
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,350
Loewen was indicted
for his involvement in the 1963 murder

862
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:13,328
of two 10-year-old
African-American girls.

863
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,729
Prosecutors allege
that Loewen,

864
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,325
who was the Jackson County
Sheriff at the time,

865
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,599
aided and abetted members
of the Ku Klux Klan

866
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,230
in the brutal slayings.

867
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,776
I beg your pardon.

868
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,447
Guard!

869
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,557
Guard!
Guard!

870
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,819
Guard!

871
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,349
No!

872
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,801
Don't!

873
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,507
These are live images
from the east side of the city.

874
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,417
Looting and burning have
continued for several hours,

875
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,353
sparked by Governor James Devlin's
off-the-record comment

876
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,084
that he would pardon
Wilson Loewen

877
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,751
if the Mayor
is convicted.

878
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,657
First, let me announce

879
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,094
that we have put
the National Guard on alert,

880
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,860
though I sincerely hope
there'll be no need to activate it.

881
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,925
- Let me stress that violence...
- We can not lose control here!

882
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,767
I want the prison locked down!
Any questions?

883
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,170
...has never solved anything.

884
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,175
The only thing that's
got me more confused

885
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,473
than the rioting itself
is the reason for it.

886
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,502
I am an innocent man,

887
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,380
and yet you are destroying
your stores, your cars,

888
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,942
your neighborhoods,
all based on hearsay

889
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:46,183
with regards to the verdict
that not only has yet to be passed,

890
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,249
- but that will ultimately acquit me.
- Lockdown. Lockdown!

891
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,385
My brothers and sisters,

892
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,295
we must stop the violence
on our streets.

893
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:58,131
By rioting, by looting,
by destroying,

894
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,227
we are doing more to damage
our community

895
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,238
than that murderer Loewen has.

896
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,366
There is no victory
to be won

897
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,571
when we address
hate with hate.

898
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,637
Let us take back
our city...

899
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,684
Hmm.
Rest in peace.
