1
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:40,138
Oz...
the name on the street

2
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,049
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility, level four.

3
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,053
Now in Oz,
our entire day is structured.

4
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,419
We know when we'll eat,
sleep, work,

5
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:51,424
when we'll have
free time.

6
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:55,326
Now giving a man
who's locked up free time is a joke,

7
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:58,126
'cause there are still
all kinds of restrictions

8
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,498
as to what you can
and cannot do.

9
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,503
Some people try
to better themselves

10
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,505
by reading or exercise.

11
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,507
some pray...

12
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,738
some plot.

13
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,836
Some just watch TV.

14
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,780
Live from Burbank Studios
in Burbank, CA,

15
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:19,183
it's time to play
''Up Your Ante.''

16
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,382
And here's your host,
Gordon Elliot.

17
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,687
Hello and welcome
to ''Up Your Ante.''

18
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,626
And let's meet our first
contestant tonight,

19
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:30,653
Mr. John Carpenter.

20
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,665
Now let's meet our star.

21
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,396
Joining us this evening, the divine,
the purrfect, Miss Eartha Kitt.

22
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,700
Eartha, thank you
so much for being here.

23
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,706
Categories start on fashion.

24
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,731
Take a look
at this photograph.

25
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:45,677
Can you tell me
what kind of beard this man is wearing?

26
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:48,237
l think l need a hint.

27
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,578
Eartha?

28
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,278
Well, l can
give you a hint.

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,949
- lt can also be called a Rob Petrie.
- Oh.

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,355
Rob Petrie?

31
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,222
lt's a goatee,
you stupid fuck!

32
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,091
Come on, just say it,
just say goatee.

33
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,653
He could say goatee,
but he'd be wrong.

34
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:05,892
That's not a goatee?

35
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:09,561
- lt's a Vandyke.
- Vandyke?

36
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,071
''Rob Petrie''?
Get it?

37
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,697
No, who's Rob Petrie?

38
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,334
Yo, would y'all just fucking clam it up
so l can hear the answer?

39
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,936
- Count!
- lt's a Dick or a Vandyke.

40
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,310
Up My Ante!

41
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:27,753
Yes, television keeps us busy,
keeps us happy.

42
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:30,517
l'm what we call
a segment producer.

43
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,526
Each of our shows is divided
into four 10-minute stories,

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,528
anchored
by a different newsman.

45
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:39,328
- l work for Jack Eldridge.
- l like Eldridge. He's a ball buster.

46
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,824
That piece you did on heating oil,
you really tagged that corporate clown.

47
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:44,461
Have a seat.

48
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,098
We want to do a three-part series
on Oswald.

49
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,507
You know, inside one of
America's toughest prisons.

50
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:53,240
- No.
- No?

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,182
Like l said, l saw what he did to that
guy, and l don't want to be that guy.

52
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,344
What have you got to hide?

53
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,650
Nothing. But in the four years
since we had the riot,

54
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,178
life around here's
been rough.

55
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,282
Attitudes are just starting
to settle down.

56
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:08,726
You bring in the TV cameras,
you're gonna stir the situation up.

57
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:12,664
Well, l've spoken
to the commissioner, and he's agreed.

58
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:18,261
- Then l'll call the Governor.
- He also agreed.

59
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,676
Well, if you already had permission,
if you already knew it was a done deal,

60
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:28,306
- why'd you even ask me?
- To get your honest reaction.

61
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:33,277
First we're gonna do
an overview of life in Oswald,

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,720
then we're gonna follow
one new prisoner coming in

63
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:37,950
and we will close
with Jack Eldridge

64
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,982
spending the night
locked in a cell.

65
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,359
- Spending the night?
- Yeah, just him and one real inmate.

66
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:46,160
By the way, when does
the great man get here?

67
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,689
Not till the day
we actually shoot.

68
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,861
For the next few days
l'm gonna have a crew here

69
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,768
while l do
preliminary interviews

70
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,797
with you staff members
and as many prisoners as possible.

71
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,810
Please understand, our goal
is to show the audience

72
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,938
how incredibly difficult
your jobs are

73
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,882
and to kick
''60 Minutes'' in the ass.

74
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:08,580
That's all.

75
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,852
Tomorrow and for several days,

76
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,585
a television crew
will be walking the halls

77
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,753
taping a piece on Oz
for their news magazine.

78
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,857
Quiet down! Quiet!

79
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,067
Now l know when the cameras
are rolling

80
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:29,371
you guys will run through
your bag of tricks-- plead innocent,

81
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,877
run scams, cry foul,

82
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,778
or whatever else you think
is gonna get you some attention,

83
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:37,476
get your faces on TV.

84
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,542
But let me warn you,

85
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,419
when those cameras are gone,

86
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,423
l'll still be here.

87
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:47,324
When the story airs,
l will be watching

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,524
and l won't forget
what you say or what you do.

89
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:52,997
That is all.

90
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,365
Lights out!

91
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:08,212
l gotta think
of some good shit to tell this jamook.

92
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,580
He's only gonna use
the best stuff.

93
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:14,212
- You gonna make shit up?
- l can't tell him the truth, can l?

94
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:17,553
But l want to be on camera.

95
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,785
Can't let these
matinee idol looks go to waste.

96
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,057
Callate!

97
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:26,224
Ay-yi-yi.
Callate.

98
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,598
You gonna sit down
with those news people?

99
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,125
Yes, l am.

100
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,833
l've got a lot to say about
the conditions up in here.

101
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:36,865
- What if they ask about Adebisi?
- Adebisi.

102
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,615
The court found me innocent
of his death by way of self-defense.

103
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,211
Even McManus testified
on my behalf.

104
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:49,813
But still, the reporters--

105
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,824
they're bound
to dig up old bones

106
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:53,883
and make us Muslims
look bad.

107
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,225
Arif, l am not afraid.

108
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:02,066
- We gonna be on TV?
- l am.

109
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,436
But if you see a camera, you duck
out of sight, all right?

110
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:11,240
- Why?
- You don't remember Jack Eldridge?

111
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:13,643
- No.
- Well, l do.

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,511
He fucked us over, Cyril.

113
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,379
He fucked us real bad.

114
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,716
This might be
our chance to get even.

115
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,745
Go to sleep.

116
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:31,053
Hey, girl!

117
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,009
Prisoner number 01W7 11,

118
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,310
Omar White;

119
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:54,048
Convicted
January 4th, 2001 ;

120
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,920
Murder in the first degree.

121
00:07:56,956 --> 00:08:00,585
Sentence: 75 years,

122
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,289
up for parole in 20.

123
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,499
Yo, that's what
l'm talking about.

124
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,297
Check out--
look at the poontang nooky.

125
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,303
This is Receiving
and Discharge,

126
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:14,465
where prisoners come in, where prisoners
go out, unless they're in a body bag.

127
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:20,104
- Okay, so which one is Omar White?
- White, Omar!

128
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,614
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, come here.

129
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,751
l'm Officer Murphy.

130
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:29,551
This camera crew has been authorized
to follow you on your first day.

131
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,990
- You got a problem with that?
- Oh, like, l'm gonna be on TV?

132
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,654
- Yup.
- l ain't got no problem with that.

133
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,755
- What, you and me, baby?
- Easy, Omar.

134
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:43,132
Mr. White, you will be serving
75 years for murder.

135
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,128
- ls that correct?
- Look, l ain't even know the bitch.

136
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,232
l mean, why the fuck--
why would l shoot her?

137
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:52,403
Well, she was the prime witness
at your cousin's murder trial.

138
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:55,243
See, your mistake
was not killing that little girl, too.

139
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:57,249
You think?

140
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,183
Shit.

141
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:03,417
- l mean-- shit.
- Get back in line, you mutt.

142
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,048
Who the fuck
are you calling mutt, huh?

143
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:08,857
Jake Willard,
escort Mr. White back in line!

144
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:09,953
Get out of my face!

145
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,294
Hey, hey!
See what l'm saying?

146
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:15,392
l'm gettin' hosed up in here!
Get your hands off me, motherfucker!

147
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,699
Y'all don't know
who you're fucking with.

148
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:21,730
So, 500 prisoners
arrive each week?

149
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,968
- Uh-huh.
- And how many are released?

150
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:26,603
Not enough.

151
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,709
This is Emerald City,
also ''Em City,''

152
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,015
the experimental cell block
started by Tim McManus five years ago.

153
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:37,887
ln Em City, the prisoners are given
a lot more leeway than the rest of Oz.

154
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:41,291
Hey, baby,
how about a little head?

155
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,228
Hey, Hoyt, move along!
Jesus.

156
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:48,765
Okay, the first one
l want to talk with is Tobias Beecher.

157
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,792
Um, all right,
this way.

158
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,138
Okay, Mr. Beecher.
The way this works is that you and l

159
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,507
are just gonna talk
very informally, no pressure,

160
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:00,535
and based on our conversation,
we'll decide

161
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,605
if you get interviewed
by Jack Eldridge.

162
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,608
- So the camera's not on now?
- No, yeah, it's on.

163
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,952
- But we can turn it off if you want.
- l don't care.

164
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:13,720
Okay, you came to Oswald in 1997
as a result of a DUl

165
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,558
- vehicular manslaughter conviction.
- Uh-huh.

166
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,621
Prior to that you were
a successful lawyer

167
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:21,133
from a prominent family
with a wife and two children.

168
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,192
How has being in prison
changed you?

169
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,274
Well, describe some of your experiences
since coming to Oswald.

170
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:32,267
Describe?
Hmm...

171
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:34,974
ever read
''The Book of Job''?

172
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:38,279
According to the file, at one point
your had your arms and legs broken

173
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:41,446
- and in another you were stabbed.
- Yeah.

174
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,455
You wanna see the scar?

175
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:47,084
You once tied a fellow inmate
down and defecated on his face.

176
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:53,390
- Yeah.
- ls that what it takes to survive?

177
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:59,135
l'm not the man l was.

178
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:02,403
Or maybe now l'm the man
l always was and never knew.

179
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,036
All these incidents
involved two other prisoners,

180
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:07,205
Christopher Keller
and Vernon Schillinger.

181
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,339
Tell me about your
relationship with them.

182
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:12,579
We sing
in the choir together.

183
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,485
What's going on?

184
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,520
Well, either he stole drugs
or he owes for drugs.

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,106
So there a lot
of drugs in Oswald?

186
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,114
Define ''a lot.''

187
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:45,606
Well, how many people in this unit
use heroin on a regular basis?

188
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,414
l don't know.

189
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:50,115
One in two, one in three,
one in 20?

190
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,330
l don't know.

191
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:01,265
Okay, how about sex?

192
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,792
- ls that an invitation?
- Sh-- right.

193
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,900
So, a lot
of homosexual activity?

194
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:12,240
Well, by homosexual,

195
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,145
do you mean deep-rooted love
of one man for another

196
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,172
or guys fucking guys
in the ass?

197
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:20,481
- Ass-fucking.
- Shit happens.

198
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,580
- And the authorities?
- Frown on it,

199
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:26,319
But they do
their darnedest to stop it.

200
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:31,422
- As they do on the drug taking.
- Yes.

201
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:34,831
- And have you?
- What?

202
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:38,303
Fucked a guy up the ass?
Gotten fucked?

203
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:44,775
Well, if l had,
why would l say so to you?

204
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:49,942
- Tobias Beecher.
- What about him?

205
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:53,281
l don't know, you tell me.

206
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:56,652
We sing
in the choir together.

207
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,932
That camera's making me so nervous,
l can't even shuffle.

208
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,400
Give me the cards.

209
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,705
Do l look okay?

210
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,206
You look like you.

211
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,539
Oh, shit.

212
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,568
When l was on TV
after l escaped,

213
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:22,581
l couldn't believe how bad l looked.
My skin was gray.

214
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,446
Gentlemen, l'm looking for some
background information

215
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:27,078
on a Tobias Beecher's relationship
with Vernon Schillinger--

216
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,248
Get the fuck away from me!

217
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:33,816
Okay, relax, Busmalis.
Come on, let's talk to somebody else.

218
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,261
- Come on, come on, come on.
- We'll go over there.

219
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,093
That's nice.

220
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:42,693
Now all of America's
gonna see you acting like an asshole.

221
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,448
What do you want?

222
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:59,144
That news bitch was asking
an awful lot of questions.

223
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,380
What did you tell her about me?

224
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,479
Get the fuck
out of here.

225
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,088
You tell her
anything about us,

226
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,356
you tell her anything
about anything--

227
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,454
And what, huh?

228
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:14,364
What are you
gonna do?

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,391
Shakedown!

230
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,329
Later.

231
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,241
- What up?
- Shut up, you asshole.

232
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,616
Get the fuck
outta here.

233
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,472
What do we have here?

234
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,838
Come on, Briggs,
l'm taking your ass to the hole.

235
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,305
l think
l take drugs because

236
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:06,318
l know
they're destructive.

237
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,721
l feel
unworthy of love.

238
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,019
- Oh, Christ, what a load of shit.
- Tobias.

239
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:16,256
No, well, look at him being all sincere
and cuddly because of them.

240
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,991
- Keller's nothing but a poseur.
- Shut the fuck up, Beecher.

241
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,625
Shut up, Beecher.
You're spoiling this for everybody.

242
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,727
Oh, yeah, O'Reily? Oh, right, you
and Keller are butt-buddies now.

243
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,068
Let me see, when did
that happen? When who died?

244
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,973
- What you fuckin' sayin', huh?!
- That's enough now, stop it!

245
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,706
Turn that camera off.
Turn it off right now.

246
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,374
Now! Turn that light off.
Off!

247
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:41,246
Tobias Beecher
and Christopher Keller.

248
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:45,246
- What about them?
- There's a lot of bad blood.

249
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,260
There's a lot
of spilled blood.

250
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:49,761
Why?

251
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:53,060
The men in Oz
are very distressed--

252
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:55,932
mentally, physically
and morally.

253
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:59,267
Christopher Keller, for example,
is a sexual predator.

254
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,830
So does that factor into
his problems with Beecher?

255
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:06,243
You know, l'm really
not comfortable

256
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,739
specifically talking
about these cases.

257
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,774
Okay.

258
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,720
Have you ever
been harassed?

259
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,781
Have you ever been sexually threatened
by one of the inmates?

260
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:21,588
No.

261
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,618
No.

262
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,291
Hey, what are we gonna
do about Beecher?

263
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,701
- Do?
- You heard the guy in rehab.

264
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:34,865
The fucker almost goes public about us
killing Shemin and Browne?

265
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,899
He's playing around.
He would never spill all the beans.

266
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,103
Are you're sure of this?

267
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,773
Just his way of saying
that he still loves me.

268
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,112
You know, the two of you
are just so fucked up, man.

269
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,916
Whoa. Don't you hurt
Beecher, O'Reily.

270
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,353
lf you hurt Beecher,
l'm gonna have to hurt you.

271
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,916
Don't make any threats, K-Boy.
Might put me in a bad fucking mood.

272
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,499
Vern, check her out.

273
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,195
- She's not my type.
- Your type?

274
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,203
She's got a pussy,
ain't she?

275
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,764
Yeah, and like you're gonna
get anywhere near her pussy.

276
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,537
Unit B is your typical
cell block.

277
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,704
- How many units are built like this?
- Uh, 10.

278
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:17,773
- Hey, Vern, you're up.
- Him? What about me?

279
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,785
l give good story.

280
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,753
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,880
- Maybe later.
- All right, this way, come on.

282
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,157
So, you're
a white supremacist?

283
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:36,726
You people
in the media,

284
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,862
you love to label us.

285
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,896
l know no matter what
l say here,

286
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:46,037
you're gonna trim it
and make me look like a monster.

287
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,740
But, l'm no monster.

288
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,274
l'm a widower

289
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,277
whose first son
died tragically.

290
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,951
l'm gonna
be a grandpa.

291
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,553
l believe in family...

292
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,791
ln America...

293
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:07,822
ln God.

294
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:16,064
- Does that sound evil to you?
- Now your other son,

295
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,076
Hank,

296
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,046
has been accused of kidnapping
Tobias Beecher's children

297
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,140
and of murdering
his son Gary.

298
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:28,085
The FBl believes
you orchestrated the crime.

299
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,114
That sounds
pretty evil to me.

300
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,718
Lady, you don't want
to be having opinions

301
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:41,324
about things that you could not
possibly understand.

302
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,268
Oh, if l didn't know you were such
a fine, upstanding citizen,

303
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,999
l might consider
that a threat.

304
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:54,574
Yo, l got something to say.
Schillinger's a pussy.

305
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:58,811
Hey, sit down.

306
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,842
Shut your face, nigger.

307
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,921
Hey, stop filming!

308
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:07,721
Keep shooting!
Keep shooting!

309
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,218
- Keep shooting!
- Move it, move it!

310
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,067
Move it, that's it.

311
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,696
So this Beecher story,
you think it has legs?

312
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:22,434
Oh, yeah. Usually the less
people are willing to say,

313
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,409
the better the story.
l just gotta figure a way in.

314
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:27,708
Each prisoner is assigned
a number and photograph

315
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,715
and then they're sent
to their respective units.

316
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:34,583
- And White's going to Em City, right?
- Yeah, God help us.

317
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,424
Here you go,
home sweet home.

318
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:58,099
Come on, let's go.

319
00:19:58,143 --> 00:19:59,838
Yo.

320
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:03,539
What, you crippled
or something?

321
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,380
No, l'm physically challenged.

322
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:09,319
- Well, you got any tits?
- No.

323
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,721
l don't do drugs no more.

324
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,885
- Well, you ain't no faggot or nothing?
- No!

325
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,260
Thank God for that.

326
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,066
Can't stand
no motherfucking faggots.

327
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,095
Drive me crazy.

328
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,547
- So, what now?
- lt's nighty-night.

329
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,712
Lights out!

330
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:53,820
- Hey.
- The Fourth Estate is gone?

331
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,334
- Yeah, for today.
- Any problems?

332
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,997
Well, we had a minor skirmish
in Em City and a major battle in Unit B.

333
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,269
- They get everything on tape?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,004
- Did our guys respond?
- Both incidences over in a flash.

335
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:08,844
You know, l don't care if the prisoners
look bad, l just don't want us to.

336
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:11,714
Well, she seems to be
mostly focusing on Beecher.

337
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,311
- His is a cautionary tale.
- Let's hope Logan doesn't dig too deep.

338
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:17,549
l wouldn't want her
uncovering any skeletons.

339
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,818
You mean Adebisi?

340
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,791
Among others.

341
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:23,818
Television is a medium
rarely well done.

342
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,989
My Uncle Bilbo
said that.

343
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:29,262
Okay, somebody
said it first,

344
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:32,668
but my Uncle Bilbo
was the first one to say it to me.

345
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,765
Now, don't get me wrong,

346
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:39,471
l love watching the news on TV--
Dan and Tom and Peter

347
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:42,378
and maybe a little Jim Lehrer
if l'm feeling brainy.

348
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,439
l flip back and forth
between news shows

349
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:46,474
in hopes of catching
the same story,

350
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:49,612
'cause each news show tells a story
in a different way.

351
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,987
ABC leaves out a fact

352
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,015
that CBS makes a big deal of.

353
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,459
CBS interviews its expert

354
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,362
who totally disagrees
with NBC's expert.

355
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,889
NBC goes in depth,

356
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:05,734
while ABC gives the same story
five seconds air-time.

357
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:09,207
You see, l figure if l catch
all three versions,

358
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:13,837
maybe combined, l get a little
taste of the truth.

359
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,940
Count!

360
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,831
88P728;

361
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,959
96J522;

362
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:39,266
98A498;

363
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:43,136
92M220.

364
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:56,443
Yo, yo, dog.
Dog, l need your help.

365
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:58,956
C'mon, man.
You know me, man.

366
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,858
Why you wanna do me
like that, dawg?

367
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,736
Omar, my man.

368
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,399
Jesus Christ, you're looking
a little crispy there, brother.

369
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:19,571
- l gotta get some tits.
- Wow.

370
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:22,739
You know, times are lean
right now. The hacks,

371
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:25,750
they're doing too good a job
keeping that shit out of Oz.

372
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:28,082
Trick is you gotta
know the right person.

373
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,145
You have
a good day.

374
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:32,817
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

375
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:36,919
Look, l been
to every nigger up in here.

376
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,089
Look, they think
l'm a nark, man.

377
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:43,192
- Motherfucker, they don't know me.
- Hey, shh.

378
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,204
Abracadabra.

379
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,479
Now what you want
in exchange for this?

380
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:57,448
l ain't gonna suck your dick
or nothing like that.

381
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,451
Hey, l'm no
fucking fag.

382
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:02,852
l just might need you to take care
of a little business for me.

383
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:06,324
- That's all.
- l got no problem with that.

384
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:08,349
Knock yourself out.

385
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,767
Hypocrisy.
Hyp-ocrisy.

386
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,739
That's what this is.

387
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,106
They strip me
of my clothes, of my rights,

388
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,111
they strip me
of my self-respect.

389
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:29,114
All 'cause they say l broke the rules--
trafficking in illegals.

390
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,912
But they-- they more guilty
than l could ever be.

391
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,918
Fucking uppity-ups.

392
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,920
See, they don't want
us in there.

393
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:40,050
Adebisi singing, snorting, suck.
And when his blood ran out,

394
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,255
when his blood got spilled,
the truth ran out,

395
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:46,093
and the wall of lies
got built.

396
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:50,261
After Said greased him, fucking hacks
act like he ain't never breathed in.

397
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,668
And the lies got buried
with his number.

398
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,934
- You saying there was a cover-up?
- Yeah.

399
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:58,340
Sheets and blankets-- enough to cover
up all them high and mighties.

400
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:00,607
- The warden, too?
- The warden more than most!

401
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:02,807
- All right, come on, that's enough.
- You see?

402
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,577
They're still trying
to shush me.

403
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:07,346
- You got any evidence to back this up?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:09,946
Yeah, there's a videotape.

405
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:14,084
Adebisi, he documented it,
just like you're doing right here.

406
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,390
You know what l'm saying?
Right up until the fade.

407
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:19,955
You ask O'Reily,
you ask said, you ask--

408
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:22,057
- All right, shut up. Come on, let's go.
- He's got something to say.

409
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,660
He's always got something to say.
Come on, let's go.

410
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,000
- Hypocrisy!
- Yeah, okay.

411
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,131
- Conspiracy!
- Right.

412
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,164
Take a nap.

413
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:35,906
Jack...

414
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,916
l found our story.

415
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,918
l'm not sure about
all the details yet,

416
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,785
But something happened
surrounding the death of an inmate.

417
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,881
Yeah, and evidently
it's on videotape.

418
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,527
Well, the sooner
you get here, the better.

419
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:53,758
Officer Murphy--

420
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,664
You ready?
You're gonna love death row.

421
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,191
Yeah, rather than do that,

422
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:59,830
l wanna go back and interview
a couple of prisoners again.

423
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:01,499
Okay.

424
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,008
- And l'd like to do so in private.
- Private?

425
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,306
- Without you present.
- That's not gonna happen.

426
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:09,143
Don't worry,
l'll get permission.

427
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:17,620
She asked to see Said and O'Reily again?
What's she want with them?

428
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:20,853
Murphy thinks it might have
to do with Adebisi's death.

429
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:24,260
- But O'Reily wasn't involved with that.
- l know.

430
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:30,526
- l miss Mama.
- So do l.

431
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,163
Why'd she have
to die, Ryan?

432
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:41,007
l told you a thousand times,
Cyril, the cancer ate her up.

433
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,409
Hey, Miss Sally's on TV.

434
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:51,081
Why don't you
go watch, okay?

435
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:53,091
Please?

436
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,116
- All right.
- Okay.

437
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:03,023
How's it going, cuz?

438
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,400
- l need some more tits.
- Whoa.

439
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,837
l ain't got
a never-ending supply, you know?

440
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:10,808
Just a little bit, just till l feel
a little better, you know?

441
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,208
You know, it's too bad
you got here when you did.

442
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:17,545
Six months ago, we had tits coming out
of our fucking asses.

443
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,880
When this guy Adebisi
ran the operation,

444
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:22,910
- the well never ran dry.
- What happened to him?

445
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:26,721
He got shanked.
But that's not the point.

446
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,726
When he died,

447
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,388
the spicks and the wops,
they took over everything.

448
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,762
And between you,
me, and this sink,

449
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,767
they're doing
a half-assed job.

450
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:38,429
- How come brothers don't organize?
- They should.

451
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,566
They need a leader. l mean, right now
all they got is this fool, Poet.

452
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:45,542
- He's a complete come-stain.
- l know, l used to run my block.

453
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:48,045
Well, there you go.
Maybe you should step up,

454
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,071
- Huh?
- Yeah.

455
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,275
Come here.

456
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:59,752
- Have some.
- Shit yeah.

457
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,521
You see, to get anybody's
attention around this place,

458
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,961
- you gotta do something large.
- Large?

459
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,363
Yeah, like Adebisi.
He was large and in charge,

460
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,890
bigger than life,
feared by one and all.

461
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:14,031
Yeah, well, that's what l want.
l want 'em to fear me.

462
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:17,200
Then you gotta
kill somebody,

463
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:20,734
but not just anybody.
You gotta go huge...

464
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,747
monumental.

465
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:25,875
Somebody...

466
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,943
- famous?
- Like who?

467
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:32,445
All right, who's next?
Come on through, lady.

468
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,721
Step over here,
open your purse. Next!

469
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:38,922
Put all metal objects
in there. And you're visiting?

470
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,660
Peter Thorpe.

471
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,158
Go through again.
And your name is?

472
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:48,195
- Helen Keating.
- And the watch.

473
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,176
Christ, what do you think l'm trying
to smuggle in, a fucking bazooka?

474
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,178
Oh, officer,
can you, please...

475
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:56,146
Ah, Tom.
Listen, he's okay. Let him in.

476
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:59,582
Oh, why didn't you say?
l'm a big fan.

477
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,417
Yeah. Oy, oy!
Wake up.

478
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:13,531
- Jack?
- Yeah?

479
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,193
- This is Ryan O'Reily.
- Uh-huh.

480
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,202
- Jack Eldridge.
- Oh, how do you do?

481
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,295
Hi. You don't
remember me,

482
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,738
- do you?
- No, l'm afraid not. Have we met?

483
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:26,733
- About 20 years ago.
- Oh, well, you'd understand then.

484
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:29,872
Yeah, you must meet so many people
in this job, right?

485
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:32,645
- What were the circumstances?
- lt's not important.

486
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:35,915
- Oh.
- Okay, Ryan. Comfortable?

487
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:39,515
Ah, yes.

488
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:42,083
And we are... rolling.

489
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:48,332
Where were you
when Adebisi died?

490
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:49,663
The common room.

491
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,566
Any inkling as to what
was gonna happen to him?

492
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,867
No, no. As far
as l could see, Said and Adebisi,

493
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,896
they were
getting along just fine.

494
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,602
Okay, so walk me
through this.

495
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:00,110
- You were in the common room...
- Doing nothing.

496
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:02,409
And?

497
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,915
l heard this noise
from Adebisi's pod...

498
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:09,982
and he had these white curtains
hanging up in the room, and, poof...

499
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:15,419
it just went red with blood everywhere,
splattered. And then Adebisi,

500
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,985
He falls out of the pod,
down on the ground, dead.

501
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,929
And Said follows out

502
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:23,093
with the shank
still in his hand.

503
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,036
- Have any idea what led to the fight?
- No.

504
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,039
All right.

505
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:31,133
You told me there were curtains on
the windows of Adebisi's pod.

506
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:32,973
- ls that unusual?
- Yes.

507
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:35,673
- Was Adebisi privileged?
- Privileged?

508
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,683
Was he allowed to get away with things
the rest of you weren't?

509
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,789
Hold on for a second.
Excuse me.

510
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,315
Wanna kill
these things?

511
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,794
Sure. Dell, guys, cut.

512
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,361
What's the problem?

513
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,700
You want this knowledge,
you're gonna have to pay.

514
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:01,535
We don't pay informants.

515
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:04,701
- Then l'm not saying another word.
- Ryan, in the prescreen you said

516
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:08,076
- you would tell everything you know.
- Look, it's gonna cost me.

517
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,673
The warden's gonna be up my ass
like one of them proctoscopes.

518
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:12,706
All l'm looking for here
is a little compensation.

519
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:15,276
No! Get the fuck out.

520
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:21,959
Suit yourself, Mr. Eldridge.
Pleasure to see you again.

521
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:26,492
You bastard.
Find out where the fuck l know him from.

522
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:30,666
- How am l gonna do that?
- Well, use your head!

523
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:34,934
l certainly didn't meet O'Reily at
a cocktail party on the Upper East Side.

524
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:38,272
20 years ago, l bet l did
a story on him. Track it down!

525
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,074
Commendable work, love.
Nice fucking interview.

526
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,147
A pleasure
meeting you finally.

527
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,485
- l've admired you for years.
- Thank you.

528
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,151
The feeling
is mutual.

529
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:55,784
l've read
both your books.

530
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:58,159
Well, actually
there are three.

531
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,426
l've always felt
that your conviction

532
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,695
was politically motivated.

533
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,328
Gentlemen?
We're ready if you are.

534
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:09,629
Well, just relax,
speak your mind.

535
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,314
Minister Said,
you murdered Simon Adebisi.

536
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:24,186
No, l, um--

537
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,349
defended myself.

538
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,291
He attacked me
with a knife.

539
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,657
Why?
Why did he attack you?

540
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:32,094
l was under the impression

541
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,564
that we were gonna talk about
the conditions in Oz.

542
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,261
Well, isn't this one of the conditions?
Brutality, senseless violence?

543
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,668
Was his attack
on you unmotivated?

544
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:41,035
No.

545
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:44,166
So you said something to him,
you did something to him.

546
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,372
l'm a Muslim. l did not agree
with some of the ways

547
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:50,108
that Adebisi
was conducting himself.

548
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:54,915
Then why did you ask
to move into Adebisi's pod?

549
00:32:54,953 --> 00:32:57,888
You see,
l have here a form

550
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:01,722
signed by you,
requesting the change.

551
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,456
lf you hated
Adebisi so much--

552
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,657
- l didn't say l hated him.
- Then why live with such an animal?

553
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:08,029
l was trying
to save him.

554
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,830
And yet instead
you killed him.

555
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,770
What about the videotape
documenting Adebisi's conduct?

556
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,645
You know, right now
l would like

557
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,513
to move past this
particular conversation

558
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,813
and speak about
the larger issues.

559
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:28,546
Do you deny that
there's a videotape?

560
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:31,384
Every day we suffer

561
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,391
fundamental
civil rights abuses.

562
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:35,416
The tape, sir,
yes or no?

563
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,028
l am done
talking with you.

564
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:43,091
Minister, we are only
trying to get the facts.

565
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:45,694
That part of
the story is over.

566
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,967
Don't you understand?

567
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,769
Adebisi is dead.

568
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:51,776
Adebisi is irrelevant.

569
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,438
Nothing that brings about
the death of a man is irrelevant.

570
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,947
You want us to hear
what you have to say, fine.

571
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,949
You have to tell us
what we need to know first.

572
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,281
And then which part
will be aired?

573
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:08,353
They're definitely working
the angle on Adebisi.

574
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,293
His death?

575
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:12,159
Nope, what went on
before that.

576
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:15,257
Poet told them about the videotapes
that Adebisi made.

577
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,665
Christ.

578
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,067
Yeah, and they're trying
to verify that the tapes exist.

579
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:21,436
- Maybe we should pull the plug.
- l can't do that.

580
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,441
l spoke to both
the commissioner and the governor

581
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:27,070
And they feel if we back out now,
it'll only look worse.

582
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:30,081
And since l never told either of them
about the videotapes--

583
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:32,606
Well, l sure as hell
can't tell them now.

584
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,242
Well, you may
have to, Leo.

585
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:36,947
The truth may
have to come out.

586
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:46,364
- Hey.
- Hey.

587
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,595
So, you got
information for me?

588
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:53,001
l can't go on camera
and say the things that need to be said.

589
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:54,470
Why not?

590
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:57,031
Because it'll be the end
of Leo's career

591
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,509
and the Governor will
have enough ammunition

592
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,535
to close down
Emerald City permanently.

593
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,444
Okay.

594
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:06,780
So, then what would you
be willing to say?

595
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,843
On camera, nothing.

596
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,313
But as deep background...

597
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:18,990
the guy you want to go
after is Martin Querns.

598
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,555
He ran Emerald City
after you.

599
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:25,860
And what about
that videotape?

600
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:27,838
Have you seen it?

601
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,432
Has Glynn?

602
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:35,879
Come on. Talk to me.

603
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:39,513
What you're asking me
to do is betray a friend.

604
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:41,280
Friend?

605
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,946
He fired you.

606
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:44,716
With good reason.

607
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,753
And he gave me
back Em City.

608
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,518
Like l said,
go after Querns.

609
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,269
Leo, what the fuck
is going on?

610
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:01,101
l get a call asking me
if l'm willing

611
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:03,164
To be interviewed by
Jack fucking Eldridge?

612
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,200
They found out what went on in Em City
when you were in charge.

613
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,940
-They heard about the videotapes.
- Fuck.

614
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,381
When you asked me to resign, you said no
one would ever know the reason,

615
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,352
that we were gonna keep it internal so
that neither one of us would get hurt.

616
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,581
Refuse to do
the interview. l did.

617
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:20,182
Fine.

618
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:22,659
Where are
the videotapes?

619
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,184
ln a safe place.

620
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:27,460
What are you keeping them around for?
Destroy the tapes, Leo.

621
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:30,559
Destroy the goddamn
motherfucking tapes now!

622
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,922
Warden.

623
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,587
Mr. Eldridge.

624
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,995
So, l understand you've canceled
our interview.

625
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,499
- That's right.
- May l ask why?

626
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,297
You can ask.
l won't answer.

627
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,825
Come on,
off the record,

628
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,701
between two guys
holding their dicks.

629
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,037
When l was thinking of running
for Lieutenant Governor,

630
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:12,042
l spent too much time
in front of the camera.

631
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,510
Between you and me,
off the record,

632
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,707
that's bullshit.

633
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:21,810
- You've spent how many years at Oswald?
- Too many.

634
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:24,378
Yet it would bother you
to leave, right?

635
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,390
To quit?

636
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:29,689
To be forced out
because of some indiscretion?

637
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,754
Because some mishandling
of the job was exposed on TV?

638
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,771
l've spent my entire life
punishing people,

639
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:44,138
and over the years,
l've had to make choices.

640
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:47,508
Some were good
and some led to violence.

641
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:49,877
Lives have been lost
and l...

642
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:53,907
l wonder, could l have
stopped the carnage?

643
00:37:57,221 --> 00:37:58,848
Simon Adebisi,

644
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,687
could you have
prevented his death?

645
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,588
Yes.

646
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:11,568
Balls-on truth,
l should be fired.

647
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:13,798
But l'm afraid
whoever they bring in

648
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:15,931
to replace me would
only be worse.

649
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,607
lt's a terrible thing
to reach this point

650
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:23,171
and realize your whole life
has been a sham.

651
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:26,240
So for a man whose job
is meant to punish others,

652
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,912
you ultimately punish yourself
more than anyone.

653
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,716
Off the record?

654
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:32,655
Yes.

655
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,453
No comment.

656
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,263
Lisa.

657
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:53,738
What?

658
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:58,238
- The Adebisi story, it's a dead end.
- What? Jack, no.

659
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:01,547
My instincts tell me that no one is
gonna come forward with the facts.

660
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:05,386
We've faced tougher resistance than this
before. l can get McManus to crack.

661
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:08,358
Some people do things for malicious
reasons. This prison is full of them.

662
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:11,794
l don't think Leo Glynn is one. He's
imperfect, but he's not incompetent.

663
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,195
That is no reason not
to expose what happened here.

664
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:16,496
- A man died.
- Yeah, from all appearances, a bad man.

665
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:19,833
You're making judgments now?
What, he isn't as important as the Pope?

666
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:22,704
Don't get high and mighty with me.
l've brought presidents,

667
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,300
serial killers,
corporate giants to their knees.

668
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:28,540
- And now's not the time to go soft.
- l'm going home.

669
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,843
Big day tomorrow.

670
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:34,818
You're making a mistake, Jack.
Letting this story go is a mistake!

671
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,377
Yeah, probably, but you know,
every once in a while,

672
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:40,414
even a newsman
has to have a heart.

673
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,790
Hey, can l have your
autograph, Mr. Brokaw?

674
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:49,356
What a dick.

675
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,670
Journalists are supposed
to be impartial.

676
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:00,667
They're supposed to keep their
personal opinions to themselves.

677
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:05,240
However, on TV, we know
what the reporter is feeling.

678
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,581
We see Sam Donaldson
or Andrea Mitchell

679
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,210
giving us the facts,

680
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:11,585
but with the camera
that close up,

681
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,284
we can also tell
by a raised eyebrow,

682
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:16,486
a tiny inflection,

683
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:18,825
what they really think
about the person

684
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:20,592
who they're
reporting on.

685
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:24,567
Now, Walter Cronkite,
he had the poker face.

686
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,832
Nobody ever knew what
old Walt was thinking.

687
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,738
So while he was
telling the truth,

688
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,366
he was also lying
to the camera.

689
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,003
That's genius!

690
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:37,238
Yo, yo, yo, O'Reily,
O'Reily, my man.

691
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,181
Yo. l forgot
to thank you, man,

692
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:42,448
for getting me put down
in this cafeteria. This shit is dope.

693
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,614
Oh, hey, no problem, cuz.
Hey, come here.

694
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,123
l got a little
something for you.

695
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,126
Hey, little morning
pick-me-up.

696
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,821
We call it
''the duster.'' Yeah.

697
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:54,161
So, Omar, l hear
you're the lucky fuck

698
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:57,599
who's gonna spend the night
in the cell with Jack Eldridge.

699
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:02,072
l'm gonna be a TV star,
shit, like... Martin Lawrence

700
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:05,405
or Bart Simpson and shit.
This shit is good, man.

701
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,570
Have some more.
You know, l just hope

702
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:09,580
he doesn't disrespect you,
that's all.

703
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,514
Dis me?
How he gonna dis me?

704
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:15,076
Well, l overheard him
telling somebody yesterday

705
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,019
- that you were a faggot.
- Yeah?

706
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:19,750
Yeah, that's what
he said.

707
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,554
- Faggot?
- Yeah.

708
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:24,584
- l ain't no motherfucking faggot!
- Omar, Omar, Omar, hey!

709
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,426
l know that,

710
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:28,432
but you know
them news media cocks,

711
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,093
they love
to twist shit around.

712
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:32,261
You know, they don't
give a fuck about the truth.

713
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,931
They make a guy look the way
they want him to look

714
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:37,600
for the sake of their story,
to boost the ratings.

715
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:40,304
Ratings?
Fuck the motherfucking ratings.

716
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:42,175
This motherfucker ain't calling me
no faggot!

717
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:46,946
But the funny thing is, is the tabloids
say that Eldridge is actually a faggot.

718
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:49,612
l heard that somewhere,
l know.

719
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,622
He's like one of them
closet cases, you know?

720
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,783
But to cover up
his shame,

721
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:56,225
he's gonna skunk you
on national television.

722
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,921
No.

723
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,520
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Huh?

724
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:02,124
- Those eggs ain't gonna fry themselves.
- l'm coming.

725
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:06,796
- Okay, let's go, man.
- l know, l'm coming.

726
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:08,237
Hey, if l were you,

727
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:11,571
tonight when l was alone
with that cocksucker,

728
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,170
l'd teach him a thing or two
about being a real man. Enjoy that.

729
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,078
- Hello, hello.
- Mr. Eldridge.

730
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,285
Hello, Lisa.

731
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:30,920
Jack.

732
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,556
What did you find out
about Ryan O'Reily?

733
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:36,260
When he was 16, you did
a piece on urban gangs,

734
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,428
about how the black kids were taking
over the turf of the whites,

735
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,871
- especially the lrish.
- l interviewed O'Reily?

736
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,841
Yeah, and his brother Cyril.

737
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:46,901
Here are
the transcripts.

738
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:47,968
Lisa.

739
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,946
l don't have time
to read that.

740
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,608
Did Jack make
O'Reily look bad?

741
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:54,948
l reviewed the tape
last night and yeah,

742
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:58,285
the O'Reilys came off
as being brutal, heartless.

743
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:01,120
l want to
see that tape.

744
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,921
Let's go,
come on in.

745
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:09,595
Watch the paint.

746
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,473
At 5:00, all the prisoners are locked
down in their cells. 9:00, lights out.

747
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:20,477
- Until?
- 6:00 am.

748
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:24,242
Oh, Mamacita.

749
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:28,082
Keep it in your pants, Guerra.
Let's go, keep a-moving.

750
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,746
Jesus.

751
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:34,753
There he is.
There's the fuck.

752
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:38,159
- Omar, just chill out till tonight.
- No, the bitch is mine.

753
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:40,095
Hey, Omar!

754
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,258
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Get the fuck off me.

755
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,632
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, you!

756
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:46,762
You fuck.

757
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,897
- You fuck.
- What's your problem, White?

758
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,034
- l got your punk for you, all right?
- White, what's your problem?

759
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:53,771
What's my problem?
He's my problem!

760
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,779
l got another problem,
too, all right?

761
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:58,611
This! This is
my fucking problem!

762
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:04,349
- Hey, hey, hey, relax, man.
- Calm down, White. Let's go.

763
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:06,583
Fuck!
He's got a knife.

764
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,661
Central, this is 11,
we got a 66. Lockdown!

765
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:15,359
Mineo, you Guinea fuck,
you want some more?

766
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:16,923
Put down the shank!

767
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:22,535
Come on, you fucking bitch!
Come on, l'll fuck you up!

768
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:33,776
Motherfuckers!

769
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:35,445
Motherfuckers!!

770
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:37,579
Motherfuckers!

771
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:39,612
God damn it.

772
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,618
This is exactly why l didn't want you
here in the first place.

773
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,893
l think at the very least
you ought to postpone.

774
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:50,867
No, by postpone, you mean
never reschedule.

775
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:53,165
Our concern is for
your safety, Mr. Eldridge.

776
00:44:53,204 --> 00:44:56,139
l've been at this game
a long time. l can take care of myself.

777
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:59,370
So we're gonna go ahead with it tonight?
You're gonna sleep in a cell?

778
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,470
Yes, but now we have to find someone
else to match up with Jack.

779
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:05,209
Well, we could put you
in a cell alone.

780
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:07,979
Ted Koppel did that on ''Nightline.''
lt was horseshit.

781
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,577
Then who?

782
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,713
l've been reading the files
on the O'Reily brothers.

783
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:13,815
The younger one, Cyril,

784
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,554
he's now brain damaged
and under medication

785
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:19,324
to control his actions.
l choose him.

786
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:23,231
l don't want my brother
involved with this, okay? l refuse.

787
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:25,565
O'Reily, we don't
have a choice.

788
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:28,731
Let's just try to make it through
the night and pray for the best.

789
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:33,642
You know what? You pray.
Say a whole fucking rosary.

790
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:38,841
You tested the camera?

791
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:40,976
- Twice. We're good to go.
- All right.

792
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,384
- Lock me up.
- Wish you'd let the SORT team be here.

793
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:49,052
No, l want this to be like
any other typical night.

794
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:13,717
Here we go.

795
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,261
Hello, Cyril.
l'm Jack Eldridge.

796
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:38,698
Hello.

797
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:43,604
Jack, you ready?

798
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:50,587
You're on.

799
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,114
lt's 5:00 pm
and already--

800
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:57,727
lt's only 5:00 pm,
but the prisoners

801
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:00,821
of Emerald City are already
in lockdown for the night,

802
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:03,857
two to a cell with nothing,
but a pair of beds,

803
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,028
a sink,
and a toilet.

804
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,198
The room is about the size
of the average American bathroom

805
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,605
and it smells
like one as well.

806
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:14,702
lmagine, if you can,
spending the rest of your life

807
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:18,704
locked up with a complete
stranger in your bathroom.

808
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:20,740
Who you talking to?

809
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:23,979
Well, that camera,
which l want you to ignore.

810
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:31,591
So, this evening, here we
at Oswald Penitentiary.

811
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:36,066
Jack, you gotta move to your left.
You're blocking him. That's good.

812
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,365
- What do you do before lights out?
- Wait.

813
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:45,364
- For what?
- The lights to go out.

814
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,469
Um... here.

815
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:53,106
And then?

816
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:56,078
Um...

817
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,055
l say my prayers
and sleep.

818
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,851
And what
do you pray for?

819
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,723
Oh, l pray to Jesus

820
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:15,034
that Ryan will be safe
and Aunt Brenda,

821
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:18,439
and my daddy
will smile

822
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:21,205
and they'll take care
of my mama in heaven.

823
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:23,008
Your mother died?

824
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:24,878
Years ago in
the hospital.

825
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,074
l hate hospitals.

826
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:33,552
l hate the smell
of hospitals.

827
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:39,218
- And the medicine tastes bad.
- Yeah.

828
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,731
Ryan tells me to
take my medicine,

829
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:45,792
but l don't sometimes,
like today.

830
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:06,690
What about, uh,

831
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:10,353
before the accident?

832
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:12,362
Do you remember
anything about that?

833
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:15,832
There are flashes
once in a while...

834
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:18,391
like now...

835
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:22,531
l see you...

836
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:25,064
and l think
maybe l know you.

837
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:32,113
We met many years ago.
You were 15.

838
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:41,050
You, your brother and l, we talked
about your lives in the gang.

839
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,397
You made Mama sad.

840
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:49,797
You made Mama cry.

841
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,996
You gave
my Mama cancer.

842
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:58,236
Holy shit!

843
00:49:58,275 --> 00:50:00,402
Central, this is 11.
We got a 66.

844
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:03,572
Ryan said at the grave
that you gave my mother cancer.

845
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:10,478
No!

846
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,421
Cyril!

847
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:14,481
You gave my mama cancer!

848
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:17,684
Cyril!

849
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:22,924
You gave
my mama cancer!

850
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:25,434
Cyril!

851
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:27,937
Cyril!!

852
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:28,960
Cyril!

853
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:31,338
Mama!

854
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:34,642
Ryan!

855
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:36,943
Cyril!

856
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:42,107
Jack! Jack! Jack!

857
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:44,848
- Oh, Jack!
- Did you-- Lisa, did you--

858
00:50:44,888 --> 00:50:48,085
- What? Did l what?
- Did you get it all on tape?

859
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:54,927
Television has the power
to enlighten, to inform,

860
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:59,026
to lay the bare truth
before the eyes of the public.

861
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:02,232
Television is an
extraordinary gift,

862
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:05,901
as much a miracle
from God as Lazarus

863
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,878
rising from the dead.

864
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:12,177
But do we use
the gift wisely?

865
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:14,184
Have we ever?

866
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:17,915
News anchor Jack Eldridge
became a part of his own story yesterday

867
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:21,755
as what many industry insiders called
a ratings stunt backfired.

868
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:23,760
Convicted murderer
Cyril O'Reily

869
00:51:23,794 --> 00:51:26,319
brutally beat Eldridge,
causing the veteran reporter

870
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:29,696
to suffer a severe concussion,
four broken ribs and a punctured lung.

871
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:32,361
He remains at Benchley Memorial
in critical condition.

872
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:36,100
Despite the objections
of Eldridge's producer, Lisa Logan,

873
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,540
the network has decided
not to air what was intended

874
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,805
to be a three-part series
on life inside

875
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:42,835
Oswald's Maximum
Security Prison.

876
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,041
The Emmy and Peabody
Award-winning Logan

877
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,380
resigned in protest.

878
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:49,750
We all wish Jack
a speedy recovery.
