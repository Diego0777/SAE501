1
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,978
The Bill of Rights,

2
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,708
those first 10 Amendments
to the Constitution.

3
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:45,377
We invented them, us,
the US of A.

4
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:49,150
Before our Founding Fathers
dipped their quills

5
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,623
into the inkwell and wrote
the Bill of Rights,

6
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,024
no other country
had ever defined

7
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,085
a government's
responsibility to its people,

8
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:58,723
the prime
responsibility being

9
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:02,166
to preserve liberty.

10
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,762
Liberty!

11
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,773
Of course,
there are those

12
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,367
who take all kinds
of liberties with liberty.

13
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,400
Sometime yesterday
before 5:00,

14
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,208
two inmates escaped
through a tunnel

15
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,407
under the southeast
wall of the prison.

16
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,043
Miguel Alvarez,
30s, Latino;

17
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:21,019
and Agamemnon Busmalis,
50s, Caucasian;

18
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,181
are not believed
to be armed.

19
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,157
Alvarez is, however,
considered dangerous.

20
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,921
Alvarez!

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,088
l want to assure the public
that there is a coordinated effort

22
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,792
by Warden Glynn's staff,
the local police department

23
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,859
and state troopers to locate
and apprehend these criminals.

24
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,870
Warden Glynn?

25
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,099
Warden Glynn, how long
did it take for them to dig this tunnel?

26
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,700
- l wouldn't know.
- Can we assume the digging

27
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,471
- took more than a day?
- Yes.

28
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,411
- More than a week?
- Yes.

29
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:49,279
How can your staff not have
known what was going on?

30
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:53,116
Busmalis is a low-risk prisoner who
demonstrates no aggressive tendencies,

31
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:57,180
and so was given slightly more freedom
than, in retrospect, he should have.

32
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,091
- You say Alvarez is dangerous?
- He has a history of violence,

33
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:03,186
but he's been under medication
to control that kind of behavior.

34
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,894
Hey, Hernandez, look like you missed
your chance to kill Alvarez, huh?

35
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,562
Adebisi, you'd better
shut the fuck up, man.

36
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,506
Those goddamn
reporters.

37
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:21,071
You handled yourself well, Leo,
all things considered.

38
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:22,911
l appreciate your
standing by me.

39
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,577
People love a prison break.
lt's sexy, exciting.

40
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,918
ln the end, they want
the escapees captured.

41
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,082
We know where their families are,
who their friends are;

42
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,854
we're watching every plane, train
and highway in the state.

43
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,021
- We'll get them.
- l hope so,

44
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,360
because if we don't,

45
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:41,890
your chances of becoming
lieutenant governor are zero.

46
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:47,334
You had no idea
Busmalis was working on a tunnel?

47
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,342
No.

48
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,174
The truth is, l'm a little hurt that he
didn't ask me to go with him.

49
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,181
Alvarez never
talked to you about escaping?

50
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,945
When? He's in solitary,
then he's in the hospital.

51
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:01,818
Come on, Hernandez,
you hate Alvarez as much as l do.

52
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:05,052
- Help me bring him back.
- l don't know dick.

53
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:12,330
l want word out
on the street.

54
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:14,663
When Alvarez shows his face,
l want his fucking heart ripped out

55
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,692
and shoved up his
fucking ass.

56
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,364
- That's it?
- Go.

57
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:22,705
''Alvarez,
l'll kill you.

58
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,642
- l'll kill you.''
- No, no!

59
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,908
''l'll kill you.
l'll kill you.''

60
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,438
Adebisi,
feeling cocky today?

61
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,145
Always!

62
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,416
You won't be feeling so fucking cocky
after l talk to the hacks.

63
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,320
About what?

64
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,291
About you giving
the French guy the gun.

65
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,088
Warden wants to know
how Frenchy killed four guys.

66
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,356
lf l tell him it was you
that was responsible,

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,200
they're going to ship your cocola ass
to death row, bro'.

68
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,140
Tell them it was me,
l'll tell them it was you, papi.

69
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,905
Hey, that's fine.
We'll see who he believes.

70
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:01,505
So Adebisi gave the gun
to Tarrant?

71
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,948
Yeah. He wanted a white man
to shoot a black man.

72
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:07,784
- Why?
- Why? To stir things up.

73
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,914
One last question...

74
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,049
who did Adebisi
get the gun from?

75
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,461
Step out.

76
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:28,297
Who?

77
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,245
- Hughes.
- Hughes?

78
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:39,685
Clayton Hughes?

79
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,153
The day you fired him
as a C.O.

80
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,189
Oh, fuck.

81
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,432
Leo, what's up?

82
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,458
You called,
said come right over?

83
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,628
Look at you...

84
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,305
like a Zulu.

85
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,073
What's this about?

86
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,875
Right there.

87
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,678
Right fucking there.

88
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,311
Yeah, l know,
that's where my dad died.

89
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:17,749
Stabbed
by an inmate.

90
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,021
A white inmate.

91
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,422
Clayton,

92
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,434
l'm going to ask
you something

93
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,595
and l want you
to tell me

94
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:33,401
on your father's soul

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,408
the absolute truth.

96
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,501
Yes, l gave
Adebisi the gun.

97
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,406
- Feel better?
- No.

98
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,111
l knew the minute
l heard your voice on the phone

99
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,585
you knew what l had done.
Because of me, four people are dead.

100
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,053
- Four black people.
- Clayton, shut up.

101
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,647
- No, Leo, listen...
- Don't say any more.

102
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,282
Don't say
another goddamn word!

103
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,924
Officer Mineo.

104
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,125
Look, we're going
to get you a lawyer,

105
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,158
and until then l don't want
you saying anything to anybody.

106
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,864
- you understand?
- l am guilty.

107
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,566
Clayton, l'm trying
to protect you.

108
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:11,142
Hey, Clayton,
how you doing?

109
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,974
- arrest him.
- what?

110
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,981
l said arrest him.

111
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,321
Yes, Hughes gave me the gun.

112
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,694
And you gave
it to Tarrant?

113
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:36,429
No. The cocksucker stole
the weapon from my cell.

114
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:39,803
Take him to the hole.

115
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:21,745
Prisoner number 00M87 1,

116
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,774
Enrique Morales;
convicted April 6th, 2000,

117
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,616
murder in the second degree;

118
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,452
sentence: 25 years,

119
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,152
up for parole in 15.

120
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,889
Hernandez, Adebisi and me

121
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,023
- have been partners selling tits.
- This l know.

122
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,295
Hernandez is having some kind
of nervous breakdown.

123
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:46,294
- This l also know.
- We don't want a partner who is loco.

124
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,307
You come with cred,

125
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,571
so we're offering you
Hernandez's third.

126
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,771
- lf l waste him?
- Yes.

127
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,541
Do it quietly...

128
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,277
and soon.

129
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,938
- May l come in?
- Well...

130
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,963
l won't hurt you, sir.
Sit.

131
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,813
l'm not like Hernandez
or Guerra.

132
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:33,148
They're spics,
old-school thugs.

133
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,586
Me, l'm a businessman.

134
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,853
l like Armani suits,
l surf the net.

135
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,382
Really?

136
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,223
l have a proposition
for you.

137
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:43,752
Really?

138
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,426
Raul Hernandez must be killed,

139
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:51,164
but he's so paranoid
he won't let anybody near him.

140
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:55,436
l need the person he would
suspect the least

141
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,602
to finish him off,

142
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:00,442
and that, Mr. Rebadow,
is you.

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,573
Me?
l can't kill anyone.

144
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,015
You did once before,
and that's why you're here.

145
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,315
No, l won't do it.

146
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,092
Well, you see, sir,
this really isn't a multiple choice.

147
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,530
You kill him, or l kill you.
lt's that simple.

148
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:22,500
l can go into
protective custody.

149
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:26,198
For the rest of your life?
lt's pretty lonely up there.

150
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,866
l would hate to think of you

151
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,966
spending your twilight years
mumbling to yourself.

152
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,309
But if l kill Hernandez,
l go to solitary, or death row.

153
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,747
No, no, no, no.
Here's the beauty part.

154
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:40,719
We get you moved into
Hernandez's cell.

155
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,812
l'll handle
the arrangements.

156
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,789
And in the middle
of the night,

157
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,951
you stick him
in the neck,

158
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:50,019
just like you did
that guy 35 years ago.

159
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,761
You yell for help,

160
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,768
and say that Hernandez
was attacking you.

161
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,134
And l killed him
in self-defense.

162
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:00,435
Exactly.

163
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,441
Such a sweet, old fella,

164
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,170
Who's going to doubt
your word?

165
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:08,375
So do we have a deal?

166
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,075
What do l get in return?

167
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:15,719
- Anything you want.
- Okay...

168
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,245
l'll kill him.

169
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,449
l've known Raul Hernandez
for many years,

170
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,796
and he's changed,
and not for the better.

171
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,970
Sure is quieter lately.

172
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:34,030
He's edgy, dangerous.

173
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,633
And you suggest?

174
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:41,738
He needs
a calming influence,

175
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:44,511
someone like, say...

176
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,509
Rebadow.

177
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,812
lt's not my fault,
l didn't ask to move in here.

178
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,679
l know.

179
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,208
We have no say.

180
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,255
So how many years
have you been here in Oz?

181
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,985
35, give or take a day.

182
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:29,017
That's about as long
as l've been in prison.

183
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:33,624
All my life, in and out,

184
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,931
35 years and what
do we get?

185
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,800
Get?

186
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,068
Yeah, l mean, ain't we
supposed to get something

187
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:44,474
- out of being locked up?
- No, l don't think so.

188
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:50,010
l want to see
Alvarez dead.

189
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,539
l don't know why.

190
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,814
You know, it's like

191
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,378
one of those
reflexes you get

192
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:58,754
when they tap you in the knee
and your leg jumps up.

193
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:03,221
What's your first name,
viejo? Don?

194
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,698
- Bob.
- Oh, Bob.

195
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,394
Go to sleep, Bob.

196
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,786
Yeah?

197
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,186
- We got him, Warden.
- Bring the bastard in.

198
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,319
Yes, sir.

199
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,261
Bring him in.

200
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,164
- Hi, Warden.
- Busmalis, good to see you.

201
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:47,070
Likewise.
These cuffs are very tight.

202
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:49,836
Well, you're gonna
have to endure the pain a little longer.

203
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,539
- You and me are going on TV.
- Really? How do l look?

204
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,548
Busmalis was found stalking
the home of Miss Whitney Allen,

205
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,016
who plays Miss Sally
on the popular children's show,

206
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,643
''Miss Sally's School Yard.''

207
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:02,950
Any sign of the other
escapee, Alvarez?

208
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,253
No, but we're
closing in on him.

209
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:48,157
No person shall be held
to answer for any capital,

210
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:50,128
or otherwise infamous crime

211
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:53,620
unless under presentment
or indictment of grand jury.

212
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,432
Now that's part of Article V
of the Bill of Rights.

213
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,904
The first two Articles
get all the press, you know--

214
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,601
freedom of speech,
freedom of religion,

215
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,941
the gun thing,
but Article V, baby,

216
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:09,243
that's the one you've got to cling
to when they slap on them cuffs.

217
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:12,513
No person shall be compelled
in any criminal case

218
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,519
to be witness
against himself,

219
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:19,013
nor deprived of life,
liberty or property

220
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:21,117
without due process
of law.

221
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,095
Deprived of life.

222
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,248
Out of the hole already?

223
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:53,224
- Yeah.
- You missed all the fun.

224
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,251
You know, Hernandez's
murder only helps us.

225
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:59,731
Now we can go to Glynn, and tell him
that Murphy can't control Amorsi

226
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,995
any better than McManus,

227
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,264
and that Glynn has to hire
a black man for the job.

228
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,533
We tried that
and got nowhere.

229
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:09,564
The more we push Glynn in one direction,
the more resistant he gets.

230
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,599
Then we have to apply
pressure from the outside.

231
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,441
We get community
leaders to pressure him.

232
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,447
We don't know
any community leaders.

233
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:19,850
- Said does.
- No, not Said.

234
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,876
He won't get involved.

235
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,658
Have faith
and we'll see, man.

236
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,683
Have faith.

237
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,733
You're looking good.

238
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,498
l need your help.

239
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,678
Yama.

240
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,616
Let me ask you,

241
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:56,052
Do you agree that life would be
better if a black man ran Emerald City?

242
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,386
That depends
upon the black man.

243
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:00,585
Let's say you get
to help pick.

244
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:03,686
Now why would Glynn
let me do that?

245
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:06,061
Because you have
influence.

246
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:10,925
l know the man
that l would choose

247
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,996
would not be
your choice.

248
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:18,101
- Are you sure?
- Yes...

249
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,942
because you are looking
to manipulate someone.

250
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,971
And you are not?

251
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:25,006
Don't play me, Adebisi.

252
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:28,120
l know you're
up to something.

253
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,281
You and me,
we have different ways,

254
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:33,587
different reasons
for what we do, okay,

255
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:36,925
but our goal
is the same--

256
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:39,192
the survival
of our people.

257
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,396
Yama.

258
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,537
We appreciate you taking
the time to see us, Warden.

259
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:53,067
Well, l'm always open
to input from the community.

260
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:56,548
Actually, we're concerned about the most
recent incident of racial tension

261
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:59,642
that has culminated in the deaths
of several African-Americans.

262
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,051
We believe that your decision
to fire Tim McManus

263
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:05,853
as unit director of Emerald City
will only help ease the situation.

264
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,018
This murder last night,
a white man killed a Latino?

265
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,187
That wasn't
racially motivated.

266
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:13,198
Even so, the man that you have
running Emerald City temporarily

267
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,200
isn't any more qualified
than McManus.

268
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,667
What we're interested
in is this,

269
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,603
who you plan to replace McManus
with on a permanent basis.

270
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:21,697
Well, l'm going over a number
of applicants.

271
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,641
Obviously, we know you'll
select the best man.

272
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:26,542
We simply ask you that,
if possible,

273
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,047
- you choose a person of color.
- Ah.

274
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,276
We believe that many mistakes
were made because McManus

275
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,445
didn't have enough experience dealing
with men from the inner cities.

276
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:35,977
l see.

277
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:41,224
We hear that you may running
as Devlin's lieutenant governor.

278
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,525
We would certainly consider
throwing our support behind you

279
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:47,896
if we knew that you were
sympathetic to our concerns.

280
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:55,938
The truth is, l am thinking
about hiring a black man for the job,

281
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:58,375
maybe a black woman.

282
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,378
That's excellent news.

283
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:03,108
l'm not making
any promises.

284
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,446
Of course not.
Whoever's most qualified.

285
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:08,783
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

286
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:25,395
Mobay?

287
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,965
Mobay!

288
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:30,339
- Yo, man.
- Yeah, man?

289
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,775
You move my chair?

290
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,108
How many times l gotta fucking
tell you, don't move my chair?

291
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:36,171
l had to pee last night.

292
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,807
l don't give a shit
about you peeing.

293
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,947
Look, man, all day
l got people fucking with me,

294
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,752
jumping on the back
of my chair and shit.

295
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,783
- l don't need you fucking with me, too.
- Okay, okay.

296
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,835
l'm sorry
l moved the chair.

297
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,860
lt's all right.

298
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:27,964
l finished typing your speech for the
downtown businessman's association.

299
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,968
Oh, yeah?
What did you think?

300
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,095
Cut it by half.

301
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:34,128
Oh.

302
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,080
l've been summoned.

303
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,241
Summoned?

304
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:47,116
To meet with Adebisi,
Pancamo and Morales.

305
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,545
They'd asked for the name
of a Jamaican drug dealer

306
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,080
they could check with
about me. l gave them Nester Parks.

307
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,525
We busted Parks
four years ago,

308
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,085
now he's
up for parole,

309
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,757
knows we'll lean on the board
if he says the right things.

310
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,323
Well, l guess he did.

311
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,233
Yeah.

312
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,760
Well, l doubt
it's my last hurdle.

313
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:10,366
Our merry little trio will probably want
to share some heroin with me.

314
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,206
As a law enforcement officer,

315
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,109
you're not allowed
to use drugs.

316
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,046
Don't worry,
we have ways of faking it.

317
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:19,608
Usually the perps are so fucked up
themselves they don't even notice.

318
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:23,418
Even so, from here on
it's going to get a lot more dangerous.

319
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:27,084
- You worried about me, Warden?
- No.

320
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:31,460
l just don't want to have to break in
another new assistant.

321
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,897
- By half, huh?
- At least.

322
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:39,464
Where is he?

323
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:40,802
He's coming.

324
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,831
l don't like Jamaicans.

325
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,343
You don't like anybody.

326
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,511
So far, you check out.

327
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,578
But there are a few more steps
you've got to take

328
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,283
before you can gain
our friendship.

329
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:01,520
You could be
an undercover cocksucker,

330
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,052
but undercover cocksuckers
aren't allowed to use drugs.

331
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,926
And we know you've been buying
a lot of product...

332
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,968
but no one's ever
seen you use the stuff.

333
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,875
Enjoy.

334
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,141
We want to see it
go up your nose.

335
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:41,292
More.

336
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,537
More.

337
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,384
More.

338
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,998
What's up, man?
You okay?

339
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:28,444
Mobay!
Yo, Mobay?

340
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,879
Mobay?

341
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,746
Mobay? Oh!

342
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:42,691
You've got a serious problem, bro'.
Yo man, look at me,

343
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,891
l know where you at, right,
under a whole shed of shit.

344
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,365
We've got to get you
some help, man, all right?

345
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,095
Shake down!

346
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:52,968
Shake down!

347
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:55,633
Stand up.

348
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:58,199
Everybody in front
of your cells.

349
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:14,322
You, out!

350
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,404
The right of the people
to be secure

351
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:29,134
in their person, houses,
papers and effects

352
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,904
against unreasonable
searches and seizures

353
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:34,003
shall not be violated.

354
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:37,914
And no warrants shall issue
but upon probable cause

355
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,510
supported by oath
or affirmation

356
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:43,112
and particularly describing

357
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,123
the place to be searched

358
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:47,284
and the person or things

359
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:49,886
to be seized.

360
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,021
What's this, Hill?

361
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,956
l don't know,
looks like drugs.

362
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:26,030
- Those are mine.
- No kidding?

363
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:28,055
To the hole.

364
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,116
Leave us.

365
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:02,360
Hey, you okay?

366
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,529
Momentary setback.

367
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,561
l'll be fine.

368
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,193
- Al Salaam Alaikum.
- ls the rumor true?

369
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:38,168
Are you going to defend
that... man?

370
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:41,462
Yes, l am.

371
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:45,136
l forbid it.

372
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:48,146
- You forbid it?
- You swore you wouldn't challenge me.

373
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,513
Over leadership, Arif.

374
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,383
l did not say that l would
subjugate my actions to your will.

375
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,385
Harley vs. The State.

376
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,489
A black man's life sentence
was overturned

377
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,194
when it was discovered
that the judge presiding over the trial

378
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:12,760
was an active member
of the Ku Klux Klan.

379
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:15,705
So you think 'cause a juror at my trial
made anti-gay remarks,

380
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:18,471
l might get set free?

381
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,604
Let's just say at best
you can hope for a retrial.

382
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:23,011
Excuse me, Said?

383
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,243
l just heard the news
on the TV.

384
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,682
Our lawsuit-- we won.

385
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:28,310
What?

386
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:31,049
The jury decided the State
was responsible for the deaths

387
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:32,681
and injuries caused
after the riot.

388
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,089
How much money are we
gonna be getting?

389
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,923
The amount
won't be announced until next week,

390
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,953
but the newscaster said
it could be the full 45 million.

391
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,522
Oh, fuck, yes.
Nice.

392
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:44,535
- Great news, huh?
- That's very good.

393
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,538
Now if you'll excuse me,
Jason and l are working.

394
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,631
Yeah, okay.

395
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,079
Now where was l?

396
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,081
Yes...

397
00:28:57,115 --> 00:29:00,175
Harley vs. The State.

398
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:03,585
- l thought you'd be happy.
- l am happy.

399
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:06,819
Kareem, Arnie Zellman says
that we could get

400
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:11,488
upwards of $250,000 each
from the settlement.

401
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,624
l've decided l'm going to take
the money and start again.

402
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,634
Well, that's terrific.

403
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,068
l hate my job.

404
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:23,370
l hate my apartment.
l hate everything about living in town.

405
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:25,638
l'm moving to California.

406
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:28,510
California?

407
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,879
The only thing
l'll miss here is you.

408
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,777
And even this,

409
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,311
my visits here
seem wrong...

410
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,992
'cause we can never
be intimate

411
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,017
the way l know
in my heart we should.

412
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,829
l love you, Kareem.

413
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,665
And l know
you love me.

414
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:55,665
And l know why
you can't say it,

415
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,866
but please...

416
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:03,006
just this once,

417
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,016
please say it.

418
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,644
Tell me
you love me.

419
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,177
No.

420
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,356
This will make
your leaving

421
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:21,229
easier...

422
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,063
for both of us.

423
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,812
- Hello, Minister.
- Mr. Fortunato.

424
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:37,782
- My client, Jason Kramer.
- Hey.

425
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,215
How you doing?

426
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:43,081
Congrats on winning that lawsuit
against the State.

427
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:48,081
- Thank you.
- All rise for Judge Mason Kossler.

428
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:55,166
Be seated.

429
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,192
All right, gentlemen,
l have read the motion by the plaintiff.

430
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:00,204
l am ready
to hear arguments.

431
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:02,706
Your honor,

432
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:06,336
Jason Kramer
is a homosexual,

433
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,812
but he was not
on trial for that.

434
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,179
He was on trial for murder
in the first degree,

435
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:14,185
kidnapping, assault
with a dangerous instrument.

436
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,586
Now a juror,
a Mr. Christopher Jacobs,

437
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,715
during the jury's
deliberations

438
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:23,057
made continuous defamatory
statements to the others

439
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:27,053
regarding Mr. Kramer's
sexual orientation.

440
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,965
l did not go on and on.
l made a couple of simple statements.

441
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,469
Every one of those people
on the jury agreed with me.

442
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,495
And was one of those
simple statements,

443
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,404
''this should not
take long,''

444
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:39,433
that he was a fag,
that all fags should be dead?

445
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,445
l don't know if l said
those words exactly.

446
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,674
Before you heard
any other evidence,

447
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:46,047
any other witnesses,
how were you going to vote?

448
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,346
Guilty.

449
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:51,685
- Mr. Kramer.
- Yes, Your Honor?

450
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,658
Your lawyers should never have
allowed Christopher Jacobs

451
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:56,558
a seat in the jury box.

452
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,358
That was their mistake.

453
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:01,297
Normally, l would chalk it up to bad
luck on your part and wish you well,

454
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,200
but there was a judge presiding
at your trial

455
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,431
and he should never
have allowed Jacobs to serve.

456
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:09,907
And for that reason,
and for that reason only,

457
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:13,001
l am going to grant
your motion for a new trial.

458
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:15,979
- Yeah!
- Your Honor, Your Honor?

459
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:18,505
You can whine to me, Counselor,
on the way back to town.

460
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,575
Thanks.

461
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:25,414
ln all criminal prosecutions,

462
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:29,052
the accused shall enjoy
the right to a speedy

463
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:32,120
and public trial
by an impartial jury,

464
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:36,924
to be confronted
with the witnesses against him...

465
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:43,503
and to have the assistance
of counsel for his defense.

466
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,529
l suffocated
Antonio Nappa.

467
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:08,054
- The mob boss?
- One and the same.

468
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:10,294
- That took balls.
- Not really.

469
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,394
l killed him at the behest
of Mr. Chucky Pancamo.

470
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,234
Pancamo wanted to take over?

471
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:17,708
l don't know the politics, honey,
l just got the job done.

472
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,408
Lights out.

473
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:54,774
- Hi.
- Hi.

474
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:57,111
Let's get rid of this.

475
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,336
Zeke Bellinger, the ex-husband
of condemned prisoner,

476
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:23,603
Shirley Bellinger,
has requested that after the execution,

477
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:25,438
the state hand her body
over to him

478
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:28,275
for burial beside
their slain daughter.

479
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:30,543
Rumor has it that
Shirley Bellinger

480
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,516
wanted to be buried
in an unmarked grave.

481
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,541
So why's he going
against her wishes?

482
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,952
l hear hubby went
Born Again after the drowning.

483
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:50,400
Hello, Shirley.

484
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,802
Zeke, you're looking
very thin.

485
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,806
That new wife
not feeding you?

486
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,173
Patsy's a singer,
she don't have time to cook.

487
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,906
- Singer, huh?
- A chanteuse.

488
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:04,608
My, my.
Lucky you.

489
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:06,617
ls she pregnant?

490
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:09,984
We decided
not to have kids.

491
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,455
She afraid what it might do
to her figure?

492
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,515
Might ruin that
chanteusing career?

493
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,086
No, l just wouldn't
be able to survive losing another child.

494
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,261
l want to be buried
in an unmarked grave.

495
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,292
- No, it's wrong.
- All the years we were married,

496
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,702
you never did one thing l asked.
Do this.

497
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,798
- No.
- l want to be lost in oblivion.

498
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:32,241
lt's too late for that, Shirley,
you're infamous.

499
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,904
l don't understand.

500
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:36,641
l'd think you wouldn't want me
buried anywhere near Katie.

501
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:39,479
Well, you see,
you're wrong,

502
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:41,417
'cause l forgive you.

503
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:44,047
You forgive me?

504
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:47,751
lt took me all this time
to get my heart in place,

505
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,784
but Reverend Nahi's been very
helpful to me, praying with me.

506
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:52,194
Praise the lord!

507
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,698
- You forgive me?
- Yes.

508
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:57,098
What makes you think l want
your fucking forgiveness?

509
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:59,933
- Now, Shirley, don't cuss.
- You come in here all high and mighty

510
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:02,599
deciding to free me
of my guilt?

511
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,699
Well, Zeke,
l don't feel guilty.

512
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,233
l did what l had to do,
and unlike you,

513
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:09,246
at least my balls
were big enough.

514
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,240
You came to console me?

515
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:16,117
Well, l've got a little
consolation prize for you.

516
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:19,612
You and the chanteuse ought to go ahead
and have yourselves another child,

517
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:22,251
because when Katie died,

518
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:24,261
you didn't lose a child.

519
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,855
She wasn't yours.

520
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:29,696
- What?
- Your father raped me.

521
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:33,135
That child was his seed.

522
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:35,139
God damn you.

523
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,574
l'm going to put this under
my pillow tonight

524
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,915
and wait for the Tooth Fairy
to come.

525
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,724
Yeah, l need that by Friday.
l'm dead serious.

526
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,886
All right.
Thanks.

527
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:01,522
And the money.

528
00:37:05,537 --> 00:37:07,505
You know, Nikolai,

529
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:09,507
l figure since we made
our peace pact

530
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,509
and now that we're
comrades and all,

531
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,103
that you wouldn't be
charging me to use the cell phone.

532
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:16,443
Just because we're not trying
to kill each other,

533
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,881
- doesn't mean you get a free ride.
- Yeah, Nikolai,

534
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,351
you and l are the only two
who know about this phone.

535
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,684
l can tell a few people
and they could take it away.

536
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:27,248
lf the hacks
confiscate my phone,

537
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,260
you won't be able
to use it.

538
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,285
Who said l was going
to tell the hacks?

539
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,022
l'm busy here, O'Reily,
so whatever you want,

540
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,533
make it fast
and make it good.

541
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,433
- Ralph Galino.
- What about him?

542
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,528
l don't know.
Strike you odd that he's dead?

543
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:42,540
Odd?
Why odd?

544
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,940
'cause on the outside,
he had no history of using.

545
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,410
A lot of guys who were clean
outside get hooked in Oz.

546
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:49,538
Yeah, but not Galino.
He and l became friendly.

547
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,778
He was here, like what, a week?
And he goes from zero tolerance to OD?

548
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:56,514
l'm not big on morse code.
Just tell me what you want to tell me.

549
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:58,283
l got nothing to tell.

550
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,723
l don't know why anybody
would want to grease Galino,

551
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:03,386
but l do know he was having
some run-ins with Stanislofsky.

552
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:06,124
- Run-ins about what?
- You'd have to ask Stanislofsky.

553
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:10,424
Get the fuck out
of my office. Come on.

554
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:14,131
You're here because you're
concerned about Ryan O'Reily.

555
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:17,869
Well, the other day,
l saw him unwrap his bandage

556
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,935
and hit his hand repeatedly
against the sink

557
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:22,640
deliberately causing it
to bleed.

558
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,704
Really?

559
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:25,978
l'm worried about him.
He's self-destructive,

560
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:28,076
perhaps even suicidal.

561
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,452
You should examine him,
put him in isolation, by himself.

562
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,218
Mm-hmm.

563
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:36,317
l have to tell you, Nikolai,
l'm a tad suspicious of your motives.

564
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:38,591
ln my experience,
every time a prisoner

565
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,031
shows genuine concern for another
prisoner, he usually has an agenda.

566
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:53,501
You want to run that
past me again?

567
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:56,707
That Stanislofsky guy's
been talking shit about you.

568
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,716
- Stan who?
- The Russian guy.

569
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,151
What do l care about him?
He's just a nothing, nobody.

570
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:04,950
Huh-uh. Those Russian mobsters,
they're crafty, Adebisi.

571
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,820
They're crafty
and they're cold-blooded.

572
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:09,452
He came to me asking
if l'd help him make a move against you.

573
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,621
Yeah?
Let him try.

574
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:14,530
All right.
l'm just warning you, that's all.

575
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:17,033
Go away, O'Reily.

576
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,002
No problem.

577
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,946
l love it when he talks like that.
What's shaking, man?

578
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:32,575
Ryan O'Reily.
He knows we killed Galino.

579
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:35,814
- He swears to get revenge.
- O'Reily and Galino don't add up.

580
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:38,981
They weren't in business together,
and they weren't fucking each other.

581
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:41,321
So why the fuck would O'Reily
give a shit about Galino?

582
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,759
l'm telling you
what l heard.

583
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:46,025
We should take care of O'Reily
before he comes at us.

584
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:48,760
We whack O'Reily now,
the whole joint goes back on lockdown.

585
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,361
- No way. We wait.
- Hoyt, listen to me.

586
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:54,064
What, all of a sudden,
you don't understand English?

587
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:57,506
- We wait.
- Yeah, yeah. No, tomorrow's great.

588
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,533
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

589
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,811
Here you go, pal.

590
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:07,374
- Anytime, my friend.
- Yeah.

591
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,959
- Cyril, stop playing around.
- l'm not playing around.

592
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:20,122
Well, then wash behind
your ears.

593
00:40:20,164 --> 00:40:22,155
Nobody can see
behind my ears.

594
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:26,330
Listen, Cyril,
today's the day that we're meeting

595
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,804
with Dr. Nathan
and her husband's parents, okay?

596
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,501
- l know that.
- Come on,

597
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,304
You've got to take
this stuff seriously, man.

598
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:35,176
- l am.
- Then wash behind your ears.

599
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,307
- Okay.
- Thank you.

600
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:51,462
Gloria, you seem anxious.

601
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:53,657
No, l'm fine.

602
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:56,861
Well, l'm anxious.

603
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:00,362
l know, we've been
preparing for weeks,

604
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:03,168
and Sister Peter Marie
feels we're all ready,

605
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:07,076
but l'm not sure what
my first reaction will be.

606
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:09,841
l'm afraid l might
just want to clobber them.

607
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,816
Lars, they're
half your age.

608
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,818
They'll clobber you.

609
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,649
Oh, well, even so...

610
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,951
we can still cancel,
you know?

611
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,788
No. We've come this far,
let's see the saga through.

612
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,958
l still can't understand
how you can keep working here.

613
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:32,362
- How's your hand?
- Oh, it's fine.

614
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:33,995
Didn't you have to go
to a hospital?

615
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,598
lt was nothing. A little bleeding.
The wound reopened.

616
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:39,303
l heard you reopened it.

617
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,072
Really?
Where'd you hear that?

618
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,979
Some people are
self-destructive, but not you.

619
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,108
l can guess why you did
what you did.

620
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,916
l can even guess why you're going into
this interaction with the Nathans now.

621
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,582
Well, l'm here to cure Cyril
of his nightmares, that's all.

622
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:55,148
Listen, Ryan,
l've told you this before,

623
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:57,286
l am not going
to take you in there

624
00:41:57,328 --> 00:42:00,627
if you intend to cause
Gloria and Preston's parents more pain,

625
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:04,499
because by professing your love
for Gloria, you will cause more pain.

626
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:06,696
l know.
l promised you, didn't l?

627
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:09,366
Okay.

628
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,214
Lars and Patricia Nathan,

629
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:21,116
Ryan and Cyril O'Reily.

630
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:27,747
- l'm sorry.
- No, no, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

631
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:31,023
A child dies of a disease,

632
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:33,963
in war,

633
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:37,764
hell, gets hit by a
crosstown bus,

634
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:41,533
somehow you can convince
yourself his death makes sense.

635
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:46,272
But this...

636
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,972
it was all premeditated,

637
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,004
so cold-blooded.

638
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,283
l was behind him,

639
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:04,658
so l couldn't
see his eyes.

640
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:13,829
lf l had seen his eyes...

641
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:19,702
l don't know if l could have
kept going.

642
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:25,313
l keep thinking about
the future.

643
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,612
Gloria and Preston

644
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,248
were almost
ready to have children...

645
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:36,590
my grandchildren.

646
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:42,097
l hate you for taking them
away from me!

647
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:49,802
You can blame me and Cyril all you want
for not having grandchildren,

648
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,241
but the truth is
you're just fooling yourselves.

649
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:55,768
- Shut up.
- No, let him finish.

650
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:01,415
The marriage between
Gloria and your son,

651
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,317
it was over.

652
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:04,821
- ls this true?
- No.

653
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:06,516
- Liar.
- Ryan.

654
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:09,890
- We were having some problems.
- She had an affair with Tim McManus.

655
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,828
That's enough. You speak one more time
without my asking you,

656
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:14,763
l'm shutting down
this session.

657
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:18,360
- You had an affair?
- Preston and l were separated briefly.

658
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,802
- He never told us.
- We wanted to work it out ourselves

659
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:25,400
- without any interference.
- lnterference? He was our son!

660
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:27,934
And because of you,
he's lying in the ground!

661
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,844
- Patricia.
- But it's true, isn't it?

662
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,713
Because of what went on
between her and him,

663
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,945
Preston's dead!

664
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:37,921
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

665
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,582
To get us fighting
with each other.

666
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:41,352
- No.
- Yes.

667
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:45,123
You always have some plan,
O'Reily, some secret agenda.

668
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,925
Not this time!

669
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:49,125
Unlike you,
l never made it a secret!

670
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,396
- l love you!
- Stop it!

671
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:53,460
l always will,
and that will never change!

672
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:54,994
- Officers!
- No, let him say it!

673
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,667
Let him try
and convince himself.

674
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,801
Everything you have
ever done

675
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:02,506
for your entire life,
O'Reily,

676
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:05,140
you've only done
for yourself.

677
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:07,173
You don't know
how to love.

678
00:45:09,754 --> 00:45:11,949
l'm leaving.

679
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:19,719
l'll call you later.

680
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,713
Once something's bad,
it can never get good.

681
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,386
Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:49,086
l need it done
by tonight.

683
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:50,787
Yeah, l'm serious.

684
00:45:50,828 --> 00:45:54,161
Okay.
All right.

685
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:05,208
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody. Let's go watch ''Miss Sally.''

686
00:46:32,002 --> 00:46:36,632
- You're shitting me.
- No, l heard it from Kirk this morning.

687
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:38,539
Hey, who's this spic, Morales?

688
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:40,168
Yo, O'Reily,
you hear the news?

689
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:42,179
- No, what?
- Dr. Nathan.

690
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,738
Last night on her way home
from work, she got raped.

691
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:48,183
- Raped?
- Yeah.

692
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:50,483
Huh.

693
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:55,219
Article Vlll, excessive bail
shall not be required,

694
00:46:55,259 --> 00:46:57,489
nor excessive fines imposed,

695
00:46:57,528 --> 00:47:00,725
nor cruel and unusual
punishment.

696
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:04,291
Cruel and unusual.

697
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:07,304
ln Oz, cruel
is the usual punishment.

698
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,670
Sister, what happened
to Gloria,

699
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:11,732
fucking sucks.

700
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,767
- Yeah, it's terrible.
- Before we begin,

701
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:17,042
have you heard any more
about how Chris is doing?

702
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:18,605
No.

703
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:21,709
Rumor has it he'll be back
in Oz today,

704
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:24,721
though he'll be spending
some time in the hospital ward.

705
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:26,450
Where'd you hear that?

706
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,084
My sister.

707
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,094
She's a doctor
over at Benchley Memorial.

708
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:33,961
Your sister's
a doctor?

709
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:35,932
Yeah.

710
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:38,298
What's she practice,
voodoo?

711
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:41,327
Hey, can we get started,
please?

712
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:43,135
Poet, since you're in such
a talkative mood,

713
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:44,573
why don't you do the kickoff?

714
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:47,600
Okay. l wrote a poem.

715
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:51,172
Fear not love loosen
its hooks from its sheath

716
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:54,514
and capture you in its
painfully seductive grasp.

717
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:58,181
Fear not the blood
that oozes from your wounds

718
00:47:58,222 --> 00:48:01,623
and holds your patience
to task.

719
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,991
Fear not the tearing
sounds of passion

720
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:06,622
as they rip apart
the feelings at the start.

721
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:10,600
Fear not the fainting pulse
of heartbeat,

722
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:15,571
for that, that is
the very best part.

723
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:18,040
- Hi, Padre.
- You asked to see me?

724
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:21,135
You know l got shot.

725
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:23,112
You know l died?

726
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:24,774
During surgery.

727
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:27,045
They brought me back
from the dead twice.

728
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,119
Now you come nose to nose
with death like that,

729
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:33,123
you begin to see things
different.

730
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:36,752
Are you telling me
that you've changed?

731
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:41,164
Sister Peter Marie okay?

732
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:43,166
Yes.

733
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,828
l don't mean physically,
l mean here.

734
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:51,499
You know l fucked
with that woman.

735
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,443
l enjoy sex, don't you?

736
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:57,242
l'll bet you're
a wild broad.

737
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:00,011
l wanted her to help me
with Beecher.

738
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,985
Now l hear she's thinking
of quitting the convent

739
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,512
and l want to do something
to make it up to her.

740
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:10,288
Well, Chris, even you would admit
that your credibility's pretty low.

741
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:14,063
Look...

742
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:16,259
there's no--

743
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,894
there's no reason for you
or her to believe me,

744
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:20,870
but l've got to try.

745
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:24,274
l've got to try to make
her see that l know

746
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:26,299
that what l did
was wrong.

747
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,579
l don't want
to burn in hell.

748
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,707
What do you want
me to do?

749
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,345
Have Sister Pete
come visit me.

750
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:42,521
- Pete?
- Hi.

751
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,891
l just came from
visiting Chris Keller.

752
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,453
How is he?

753
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:50,763
He's back in full force.
He says that he wants to talk to you.

754
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,792
Well, l don't want
to talk to him.

755
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,675
Tobias, maybe you
should go.

756
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,008
No. We have work to do.
Stay where you are, Tobias.

757
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:05,812
He seems full of remorse.
How genuine that is is tough to gauge,

758
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,716
- but if it's true...
- lt's not true.

759
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:12,711
Chris Keller
is a manipulative, sociopathic liar.

760
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:15,350
- l won't go see him.
- But what if he really needs you?

761
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:17,587
psychologically...

762
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:20,062
- spiritually?
- That's too bad.

763
00:50:20,097 --> 00:50:23,726
- Let me go.
- Tobias, no.

764
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:26,736
Look, l know better
than you...

765
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,738
the hurt he can cause,

766
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:30,740
but still...

767
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:33,766
l-- l love him.

768
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:41,410
Take this to
Dr. Prestopnik.

769
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,479
Don't.

770
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:06,038
Hey!

771
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:09,308
Hey.

772
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,610
Beecher, what are you
doing in here?

773
00:51:11,648 --> 00:51:13,479
l came to drop off a file
to Dr. Prestopnik.

774
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:16,111
- Where's the file?
- lt's on his desk.

775
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:17,711
lf you delivered it,
take a walk.

776
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:22,189
- Yeah, l just...
- l don't give a shit.

777
00:51:22,226 --> 00:51:24,319
Take a walk.

778
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,295
l'll see you later.

779
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:39,403
Now that was
such a touching moment,

780
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:42,810
l'm going to write about it
in my diary.

781
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:49,514
Where do you think
you're going?

782
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:52,545
l have information.
Mr. Schillinger,

783
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:55,023
l'm the altar boy
for Father Mukada at mass.

784
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,185
l'm in the office
changing out of vestments,

785
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:00,958
sometimes l overhear things.
This is primo stuff.

786
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:03,466
- About what?
- About you.

787
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:13,265
What do you want
in return?

788
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,108
This guy in my unit,
Stan Buttwin, stole my watch.

789
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:18,979
Done.
What have you got?

790
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:21,780
Your son, Hank,

791
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:23,787
l know who paid
to have him found

792
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:26,119
- and arranged to have him see you.
- Who?

793
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:30,626
Beecher?

794
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:39,266
You won't forget my watch,
will you?

795
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:43,406
lt doesn't make
any sense.

796
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,307
Why would Beecher pay
to find your son?

797
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,970
This is some plan of his,

798
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:50,775
some double-dealing plan
to fuck with me.

799
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:52,782
He was going to use Hank
against me,

800
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:54,807
the same way he did
with Andrew.

801
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:57,650
What are you
going to do?

802
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:01,018
Take the offensive.

803
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:08,159
Look, l know l was tough
on you and your brother growing up,

804
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:11,065
but you've
got to understand,

805
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:13,501
when your mom died,

806
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:16,165
l had to raise you
all by myself.

807
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:20,609
l'd drop you off at school--
same one l went to,

808
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,373
only it turned into
a shithole...

809
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:24,505
niggers and gangs...

810
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:26,539
drugs.

811
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:31,176
lf l was hard, it was
only to protect you.

812
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:34,548
Yeah, l know that, Dad.

813
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:38,022
- Do you?
- Yeah.

814
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,020
l'm not like Andrew,

815
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,568
blaming you for all
the fucked-up shit in his life.

816
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:47,229
l know you did the best
you could.

817
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,533
- Thank you, son.
- You got so huggy, man.

818
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,215
Listen, l want you
to do something for me.

819
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:02,878
- Want me to do something?
- Yeah, a mission.

820
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:06,589
All right.

821
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:08,284
Yes.

822
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:10,759
- How much?
- How much what?

823
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:13,285
- How much cash?
- Cash?

824
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,696
You want the crime,
you've got to pay the dime.

825
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:19,792
$1,000.

826
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,895
l'm all yours,
Daddy.

827
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,470
Here's what l need
you to do.

828
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:32,675
- Beecher?
- Yeah?

829
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,809
- Come with me.
- Where?

830
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:36,113
Warden Glynn's office.

831
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:38,781
What's the warden want
to see me for?

832
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:41,757
All he said was for me
to get you, so move your ass.

833
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:46,188
Oh, fuck.

834
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:00,143
Holy shit,
what's wrong?

835
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:02,145
Sit down.

836
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:09,452
Tobias, there's
no easy way to say this.

837
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:12,353
Well, then just say it.

838
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,251
Your son and daughter
have been kidnapped.

839
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,958
No, no.

840
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:34,135
The declaration of independence
says that we are, all of us,

841
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:37,840
due certain rights,
the most important being life,

842
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:40,714
liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.

843
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:43,686
l mean, and isn't
that what it's all about?

844
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,086
Life, liberty...

845
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:54,123
happiness.
