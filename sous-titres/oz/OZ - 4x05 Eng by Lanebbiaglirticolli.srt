1
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:42,375
The criminal mind--
For the past 200 years,

2
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,249
scientists, sociologists
and other folks

3
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,344
who fret about
such things,

4
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,447
have debated whether
a person commits a violent act

5
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,984
because of their environment
or their biological makeup.

6
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,223
What turns on
the red crime light in a man's brain?

7
00:01:57,264 --> 00:02:02,167
lf we find the cause,
can we eliminate the effect?

8
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:06,104
Can we end violence
now and forever?

9
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:29,619
Prisoner number 00G115,

10
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:33,963
Detective Bruno Goergen;
Convicted March 15th, 2000;

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,969
lllegal possession
and sale of firearms,

12
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,698
murder in
the first degree.

13
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:41,502
Sentence: 36 years...

14
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,136
Up for parole in 18.

15
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,647
You know that guy?

16
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:00,893
No.

17
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,724
He's just
so fucking ugly.

18
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,230
''He's just
so fucking ugly.''

19
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,358
This guy.

20
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,564
When l first saw you,
l thought,

21
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,869
''What the fuck is Johnny Basil
doing in Oz?''

22
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,842
And then l remembered
last year you went to narcotics, right?

23
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:21,314
One of the greaseballs told me your name
was Desmond Mobay? Huh?

24
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,839
- You gonna blow my cover?
- Depends.

25
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:29,682
- On what l do for you?
- None of the inmates know l'm a cop.

26
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:32,556
lt was part of my deal when
l turned state's evidence.

27
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,287
l got a new identity too.

28
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,318
Now scumbags out there
find out the truth,

29
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:39,457
l'm prime beef for any asshole looking
to up his cred.

30
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,031
And so?

31
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,400
And so one hand
washes the other, my brother in blue.

32
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,372
You know what l remember
the most about you

33
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,274
when we were working
the streets together?

34
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,540
What a bully
you were.

35
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,877
Strong-arming people
when there was no need.

36
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,679
You were always
a bad cop, Goergen.

37
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:59,708
l wasn't surprised
when l heard you went down.

38
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,085
Oh, so you do want me to tell the guys
you're undercover?

39
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,060
l would be happy to help you
in any way l can.

40
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,030
Glad we understand
each other.

41
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,625
Excuse me there, Butch.

42
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,795
Butch? Yo.

43
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,899
Normally when a police officer's
brought into Oz

44
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,102
l give them
special counseling.

45
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,008
Why?

46
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,712
lt's going to be
tough for you

47
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:30,909
going from a position
of authority

48
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,851
to being strip searched.

49
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:36,219
- You might feel humiliated.
- Not me.

50
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,690
- Vulnerable.
- Uh-Uh.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,620
Okay, that's fine, but if you should
experience feelings like that,

52
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,894
- l just want you to know l'm here.
- Thanks. Later.

53
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,735
- You know, my wife's an ex-nun.
- Really?

54
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:56,105
Yeah. She fucks
like a $500 whore.

55
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:59,541
Must be all those years
of pent up chastity.

56
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:18,261
- Know what l hate more than anything?
- What's that, Mondo?

57
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,664
This white trash
trying to be thugs.

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,634
l feel you.
l hate that too.

59
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,763
How about you, pussy?
How you feel about that, huh?

60
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,933
What l hate is
jive-ass niggers.

61
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:46,453
How the fuck is this you
watching my back?

62
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,461
l got a C.O. there
as soon as l could.

63
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:53,159
- Should've pulled those apes off me.
- Apes. Yeah.

64
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,895
Niggers, yeah.
l jump in and save you,

65
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,960
a fucking white,
redneck asshole,

66
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,835
l might as well
pack up and leave Oz.

67
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,841
Well, then maybe
you better start packing,

68
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,843
'cause anything like this
fucking happens again,

69
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,242
everyone's gonna know
who you are,

70
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,007
and you're a
dead man, Johnny.

71
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,887
Hey, Mobay.
Did you forget?

72
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,450
What?

73
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,962
lf you want to join us,
you gotta kill somebody.

74
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,589
l haven't forgotten.

75
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:28,999
The new man doesn't want
any violence in Emerald City,

76
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,696
so if you're
gonna do the deed,

77
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:33,205
make it look
like an accident.

78
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,730
Do it far away
from here.

79
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,709
l gotcha, man.

80
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,397
Hill. Hill.

81
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,900
l'm asleep.

82
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:07,539
Hear that?
That's me snoring.

83
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:16,543
- l need your help.
- l don't give people help.

84
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,416
Adebisi and the others
say they will let me in

85
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,250
if l kill somebody.

86
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,689
And what?

87
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,692
You want me to volunteer
to be your victim?

88
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,489
No.

89
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:31,656
l have decided who to kill,
but l need your cooperation to do it.

90
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:34,724
That shit you're snorting
is rotting your brain.

91
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,793
l ain't helping you
kill nobody.

92
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,532
- But--
- No. No way, no how.

93
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,506
- But--
- Hey, look, shut up, Mobay.

94
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,304
l'm tired of hearing
your lips flap.

95
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:45,504
Let me get
some fucking sleep.

96
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,785
- We got problems.
- What?

97
00:07:56,823 --> 00:08:00,452
- My cellmate Hill knows you're a cop.
- Shit. How?

98
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,927
Who knows how?
He says he'll keep quiet for a price.

99
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,759
- He wants a meeting.
- Where?

100
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,993
Dress factory's
freight elevator.

101
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:10,093
Now, l say we tip his chair and let him
go tumbling down the shaft.

102
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,036
Right.

103
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,971
Fuck.

104
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:17,135
Are you sure this
guy's coming?

105
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,441
Yes.

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,810
Jeez, you don't know
how good you got it till it's gone.

107
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,444
All those times l moaned
about walking the beat,

108
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,750
l'd give
my fucking right nut

109
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,655
to be in the snow
working the fucking Spick Day parade.

110
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:36,958
Okay, Mobay.
l'm here, man. What you want?

111
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,525
You think you got
me over a barrel, don't you?

112
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,659
- What?
- So long, butch.

113
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,328
What the fuck are you
doing, man?

114
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,394
- Fuck are you doing?
- Wait, wait. Let me, let me.

115
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,872
Mobay, for Christ's sake.

116
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,034
Mobay! For Christ's sake,
wait. No, man, wait.

117
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,011
Please!

118
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,071
Fuck me!

119
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,546
You should've let me
tell you the plan.

120
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,883
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

121
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,014
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

122
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,160
Lockdown! Lockdown!

123
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,955
What the fuck happened?

124
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,433
Someone died.
An accident.

125
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,766
Far from Emerald City.

126
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:29,247
l'm seriously considering
moving to another cell.

127
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:34,583
- Relax, brother. The worst is over.
- Yeah, right.

128
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,231
Hey.

129
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,233
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,433
l thought we agreed you
shouldn't come visit.

131
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,066
Hill thought
he recognized you.

132
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,771
l am here because l'm worried
about you, partner.

133
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,211
You're supposed to
be e-mailing me regularly.

134
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,579
Not only don't l hear from you,
but when l do,

135
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:07,382
- the reports make no sense.
- l was in the hole for a few days.

136
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,082
- Are you using?
- No.

137
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:12,182
You are. l can see it
in your eyes.

138
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:15,424
- Okay, but l had to.
- That's it.

139
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,122
l'm telling the Lieutenant
to pull you out of here.

140
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,654
No! Shuman wants
the job done,

141
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,860
and l'm so fucking close
to busting these guys.

142
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,801
l know l fucked up,
but l can turn it around.

143
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:26,862
l know l can, Kina.
Trust me.

144
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:35,107
Okay, but l want to hear
from you every day.

145
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,946
Every goddamn day.

146
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,559
Warden, we need
to touch you up a bit.

147
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,693
- Touch me up.
- This is Cassandra and Betty.

148
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,829
- They're makeup and hair.
- What's the hubbub?

149
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,465
The Warden is shooting
a public service announcement.

150
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,407
Oh, that's right.
l forgot.

151
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,378
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor to...

152
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,012
Are you all right?

153
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,983
l may be
getting the flu.

154
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,789
Quick as you can, guys.

155
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,622
Warden, your wife
is here.

156
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,958
- Mary.
- We need to talk.

157
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:25,123
Uh, excuse me.

158
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,932
Warden, we're moments away here.
Sir, please.

159
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,527
Excuse me.

160
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:36,642
What's the matter?

161
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,839
l just got a call from a reporter asking
about your brother.

162
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,972
Well, l knew
this was coming.

163
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,711
He said that tomorrow the Tribune
is breaking the story

164
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,619
that Mark is serving a life sentence for
murder and did you have any comment.

165
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:52,181
l got a lot of comments,
none of them printable.

166
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:55,854
Warden, l'm sorry.

167
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:57,760
We're trying to make
our little movie here.

168
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,163
We're on a very,
very tight schedule.

169
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,394
Excuse me.
l'm sorry.

170
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,831
Thank you so much.
Sorry about that.

171
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:09,068
Okay, you guys,
just sign off on him, all right?

172
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,338
- So we can get this over with.
- Okay.

173
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,777
- This isn't such a terrible thing.
- Oh, no?

174
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,111
We anticipated that some
dedicated journalist

175
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,276
would eventually
dig up the dirt.

176
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:21,343
There's a way to use this
to our advantage.

177
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,652
- How?
- Your brother committed murder, yes,

178
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,215
but you got him
to turn himself in.

179
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,818
Three months
after the fact.

180
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:30,829
Press doesn't have
to know when you knew.

181
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,763
l'm starting to feel
like Ronald fucking Reagan.

182
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,892
We also leak the news
that your daughter was raped.

183
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,629
Public will love
the fact

184
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,069
that you know
all sides of crime.

185
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:44,168
l'm not gonna exploit
Arnet's rape just to get elected.

186
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,509
Leo, people don't vote for candidates
because of what they believe

187
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,038
or their position statements
or any of that shit.

188
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:54,144
They elect a father,
a husband,

189
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,451
a good old guy
they can chug a beer with,

190
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:59,754
someone who
understands pain,

191
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,387
because he's suffered too.

192
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,590
And you've suffered, Leo.

193
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:08,600
All l'm saying is
let them weep for you.

194
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,761
l said no.
That's no.

195
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:17,037
My advice is get your hat
out of the ring.

196
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,704
l need a Lieutenant
Governor who's got balls.

197
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,043
Open the goddamn gate!

198
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,777
l'm a family man,

199
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:28,878
and there's nothing harder
for a family man

200
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:32,152
than to see those he loves
suffer or cause suffering.

201
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:36,025
My brother's crime
devastated us.

202
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:41,028
My daughter's rape
did too.

203
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,774
There's a new study out
which claims that some people

204
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:56,145
are wired to
commit violent crimes,

205
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,673
that they have defects
in their brain,

206
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,549
that they have
less gray matter

207
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:03,077
in their prefrontal lobe
just behind the eyes.

208
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:06,114
They're missing the piece
that keeps rage inside.

209
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,959
lf true, those people

210
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,624
are predestined
to rape and murder.

211
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,735
They cannot
be held accountable.

212
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,534
Anatomy is destiny.

213
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,939
l don't give a fuck
about this toilet paper.

214
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,671
You know, take your fucking
toilet paper, all right?

215
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,236
Hey.

216
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:30,772
Lockdown!

217
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:33,580
Lockdown!
Lockdown!

218
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:38,414
McManus, where's your
fucking sense of fun?

219
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,567
- Hello.
- Tim?

220
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:51,593
- Yeah.
- Diane.

221
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,376
- Yeah?
- How are you?

222
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,313
l'm good.

223
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:04,475
l wrote you,
but l didn't hear back.

224
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,644
Did you get my letter?

225
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:09,849
Yeah. l got it.
l been busy.

226
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,720
l heard
you're running unit B now.

227
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,884
My boys behaving
themselves?

228
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:16,724
Diane, what do you want?

229
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,855
To see if you're okay.

230
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,832
l'm good.
l gotta go.

231
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:28,632
- Oh, man.
- Tim.

232
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,936
- Hey.
- How's things?

233
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:36,574
The truth?
l miss Diane.

234
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:40,518
l miss Em City.
l'm constantly constipated.

235
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:43,579
l've managed to completely
and literally fuck up my entire life.

236
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,215
That's how l am.

237
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:47,624
Constipation--
That you can fix.

238
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,491
Right.

239
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,155
Want to grab a beer?

240
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:54,257
No thanks.
l got a date.

241
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,234
Every time
l ask you to do something,

242
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:59,204
you're otherwise engaged.
l'm getting paranoid. You pissed at me?

243
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,968
When Glynn fired me,
what did you do?

244
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,635
l called you immediately.

245
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:06,167
Oh, yeah. You were very sympathetic,
and then you took my job.

246
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:09,306
Only temporarily. l told Glynn
l did not want to replace you.

247
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,145
l brought you in to Oz.

248
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,674
- When l was fired, you should've quit.
- Tim.

249
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:17,621
- l gotta go.
- Tim, you know, give me a break here.

250
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,550
Kareem Said.

251
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:51,215
According to this file,
you are one incredible pain in the ass.

252
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,191
Well, that is only one
interpretation.

253
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:56,194
Another could be that l strive
for justice where there is none.

254
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,992
What l strive for
is peace and quiet.

255
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,398
My mandate from Warden Glynn
is simple: no violence.

256
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:05,461
l applaud you on your mandate.
l abhor violence.

257
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,972
that is incredibly
sweet of you.

258
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:11,465
l'm thinking of making changes and l'm
hoping you're not gonna stir up trouble.

259
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,273
Depends.
What kind of changes?

260
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:16,281
Patience. Patience.

261
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:20,251
We must be as patient with others
as we expect Allah to be with us.

262
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:22,083
Now you don't mind
if l quote you, do you?

263
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,056
Found this in the bottom
of the drawer.

264
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,821
McManus must've
left it behind. l gave it a quick read.

265
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,761
- And?
- Didn't really hold my interest.

266
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,026
Too self-righteous.
You can go.

267
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,973
$100. Ride it out.

268
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:47,503
That's all for you
if you want it.

269
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,551
That's funny.

270
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:04,127
Prisoner number 00K251,

271
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:07,564
Kevin Ketchum,
aka Supreme Allah;

272
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,431
Convicted March 22nd, 2000;

273
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,405
murder
in the second degree.

274
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,635
Sentence: 25 years,

275
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:19,166
up for parole in 10.

276
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:20,735
This is your sponsor.

277
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,044
He's gonna help
acclimate you to life in Emerald City.

278
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,983
Kevin Ketchum,
Kareem Said.

279
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:28,646
My government name
is Ketchum.

280
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,588
My real name
is Supreme Allah.

281
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,320
All right.
Let's go, Allah.

282
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,532
- Who's that?
- Supreme Allah.

283
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:53,602
Knew him back on the corner.

284
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,114
What kind of a name
is the Supreme Allah?

285
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,639
He's a five percenter.

286
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,982
A five center what?

287
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,478
He's a five percenter.
He believes that 5°/% of all black men

288
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,787
are enlightened with the true
understanding of life.

289
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:09,124
Yeah, they also believe
that the black man is God

290
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,129
and that we whiteys
are the devil.

291
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:13,723
They're like Muslims
except they smoke weed,

292
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,757
they deal drugs,
they do what they gotta do.

293
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,770
Oh, fuck.
He's gonna be my cellmate.

294
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,603
Shit.

295
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,404
Bye-Bye.

296
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:27,469
Peace, black man.

297
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,674
Look, look, l ain't buying what
you selling, dog.

298
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:33,276
Met a lot of you five percenters along
the years, with your prophet moves,

299
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,583
sayin' how much
the Earth weighs shit.

300
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,784
You know, we stuck in here.
We stuck in here together.

301
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:41,588
And l don't need you preaching me,
you understand?

302
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:44,596
- Yeah. All right.
- All right then.

303
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:52,870
They call you ''Poet,'' huh?

304
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,532
Damn skippy
they call me ''Poet.''

305
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,370
Can l read some
of your stuff?

306
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:57,966
Why do you want
to read any of my stuff?

307
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,978
Like poetry.

308
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,809
You know,
l suck at writing, myself.

309
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,616
- Start on page 16.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,555
Some of my shit got put
in that anthology.

311
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,150
Damn.

312
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:21,057
Yo, this is good, man.

313
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,365
Fuck me, man.
No more pens.

314
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,433
Yo, yo.

315
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,684
You must fall
in line behind us.

316
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,886
l ain't got no problem
working with you.

317
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:50,327
You're not hearing
what l'm saying.

318
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:53,957
Oh, l hear clearly, Arif.

319
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,730
Thing is, you don't own me
any more than the Devil does.

320
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,903
You will obey me.

321
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,536
You don't want
to be touching me, son.

322
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:08,376
This is getting us nowhere.
Why don't you all just back off?

323
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:11,747
Supreme Allah,
you call yourself Muslim.

324
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,309
Well, we believe
that your way,

325
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,911
that is a corruption
of the truth.

326
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,855
We don't want you
poisoning the minds

327
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,950
of the young brothers
here in Oz.

328
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:23,723
l'm gonna speak my mind
while l'm here.

329
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:27,289
And whoever listens,
listens.

330
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,100
Whoever don't, be damned.

331
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:48,118
Thank you, officer.

332
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,053
You want me
in or out?

333
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:54,119
Out.

334
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:10,041
- Hey there.
- Yes.

335
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:13,707
What are you up to,
Adebisi?

336
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:16,214
Me? Nothing.

337
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:20,184
Nothing? So how am l to be included
in your ''nothing''?

338
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,187
The Earth is about to quake.

339
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,655
l came to warn you,
take shelter.

340
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,319
- How big a quake?
- Big.

341
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,828
But you, you can
be safe with me.

342
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:33,855
Once again, you honor me with your
offer of protection.

343
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:36,629
- And once again you refuse?
- Regretfully.

344
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:40,298
You can ask a girl out on a date
so many times and get refused.

345
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:44,002
You could just tell me
what's going on.

346
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:46,511
Count!

347
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,604
You'll find out
soon enough, eh?

348
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:53,874
l have decided
to junk the council

349
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,410
that used
to meet regularly

350
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:58,753
and replaced that system
with trustees

351
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,782
who will be responsible

352
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:04,922
for citing grievances
and maintaining order.

353
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:07,022
These trustees will be

354
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,830
Simon Adebisi,

355
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,268
Chucky Pancamo

356
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:15,273
and Enrique Morales.

357
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,468
Now having met with each
of you individually,

358
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,036
l've decided to transfer
several of you back to Gen Pop.

359
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,881
The following men will
follow Officer Johnson out:

360
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:30,719
97H81 3, Henke;

361
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:35,022
99S81 2, Sands;

362
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,190
98B643, Blakely;

363
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:43,725
97 S532, Simpson;

364
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,638
95J932, Jarvis;

365
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,804
98H432, Hoyt.

366
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,075
This sucks!

367
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:57,582
No one asked
your opinion, Hoyt.

368
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:01,143
That's enough out of you.
Grab your stuff!

369
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,774
Now this is nuts.

370
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,903
Making Adebisi, Pancamo
and Morales trustees?

371
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,971
l mean, they're the three
worst motherfuckers in this place.

372
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,983
And transferring
all the Aryans and bikers?

373
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,713
- l mean, what kind of logic is that?
- l'm not Tim McManus.

374
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:37,517
l'm not looking
to create some Oz version

375
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:40,116
of the rainbow coalition.
l reviewed their records.

376
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,491
All of them have repeated
incidents of violence.

377
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:45,986
- And Adebisi doesn't?
- Gonna have to learn to trust me.

378
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:48,829
l wish you'd learn
to discuss policy changes with me

379
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,301
- before you announce them.
- Not my style.

380
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,463
- Clearly.
- You don't like it,

381
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:55,905
you can follow Hoyt
and the rest of them out the door.

382
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,239
- You know what? l will.
- l'll start the paperwork.

383
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:01,246
- The sooner the better.
- The sooner.

384
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,271
Yeah.

385
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,518
Ah, yeah...

386
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,883
Did you know about this?

387
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,486
That you'd be made a trustee?

388
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:18,860
Yeah, yeah,
but l was sworn to secrecy.

389
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:21,957
- How come l wasn't made a trustee?
- Ask Querns.

390
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,468
And how come all these new arrivals,
none of them is Muslim?

391
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:27,700
- Ask Querns.
- We had a deal, Adebisi.

392
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,572
That's true.
We did.

393
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:34,067
Now if you'll excuse me,
l've got business to do.

394
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,417
No, no, no, no.

395
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,055
- We have to talk, Querns.
- Later.

396
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:54,190
- Now.
- Johnson.

397
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,202
We'll talk later.

398
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:16,153
Back off. Back off.

399
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:17,655
Hey! Hey!

400
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:20,385
- Officer!
- Get him off now!

401
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,757
Move it!

402
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,126
Damn it, we got to get him
to the hospital.

403
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:28,189
This is unit B.
Get a fucking gurney over here!

404
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,708
- What happened?
- He's been raped.

405
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,809
Gloria,
you don't have to--

406
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,579
- l'm fine.
- No.

407
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:50,019
No, Tim, l'm fine.
Let's drape and prep for an anoscopy.

408
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:55,126
You know, when l was
first elected Governor,

409
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,128
crime was out of control,
but we went to work

410
00:26:57,162 --> 00:27:00,495
- fighting for three strikes
- Hey, can you turn that down?

411
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:03,126
l'm waiting for my soap
to come back on.

412
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,693
Mac just left
Felicia... again.

413
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,227
Turn it the fuck down.

414
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:10,002
Why are you
always so grumpy?

415
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,669
Hey, what you doing?

416
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,007
Painting.

417
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:14,637
Well, they just painted our cells
a couple weeks ago.

418
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,581
Painting a mural,
asshole, a portrait.

419
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:19,914
- Of who?
- Of myself.

420
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,853
l want to leave something behind
after they execute me.

421
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,118
Miles, what makes you think
the next guy in that cell

422
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:27,489
will want to spend
his last days staring at your ugly ass?

423
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:29,790
- You calling me ugly, black boy?
- Motherfucker.

424
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:34,162
Are my little darlings raising
their voices? Do we need a timeout?

425
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,894
Lopresti, how come
you still here?

426
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,960
Shirley Bellinger told the warden
you were fucking her every night.

427
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,996
Yeah, that bitch almost got me fired,
but l was able to persuade Glynn

428
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,440
that she's a lying
sack of shit.

429
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,502
Well, she wasn't lying. You were eating
that pussy like chicken chow mein.

430
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,537
- God damn!
- l don't want to hear any more

431
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,846
talk about that cunt.
Got me?

432
00:27:58,023 --> 00:28:00,753
Things sure are different
around here without old Shirley.

433
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,657
Yeah.

434
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,856
That's been
happening a lot.

435
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,731
Yeah, fag.
You keep me up at night.

436
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,828
Jeez. God forbid you shouldn't get
your beauty sleep.

437
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,839
Maybe you should be
in the hospital, man.

438
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:16,841
No. Don't want to die
in a hospital.

439
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,469
- You'd rather die in here?
- l'd rather expire

440
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,947
sunning myself on the Riviera
in the arms of a 17-Year-Old Adonis,

441
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,505
but c'est la vie.

442
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,380
Still, maybe you should
have yourself checked out.

443
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:29,080
Thank you, Moses,
for your concern.

444
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:32,147
- You going fag, Deyell?
- When you gonna shut the fuck up, man?

445
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,055
When l die, nigger.

446
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,390
Ow!
Fuck! My hand!

447
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,862
My fucking hand!

448
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,798
Oh, fuck!

449
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:45,269
You gotta remember, Deyell, you hit
a wall, generally the wall wins.

450
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:48,238
Yeah, Moses here is not known
for his mental muscle.

451
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:50,901
l got more brains in my little finger
than you, Lopresti.

452
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,274
Well, right now your little finger
is in little pieces.

453
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,279
All right, listen.
Try to keep this cast clean.

454
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:57,042
You're gonna have it on
for six weeks.

455
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,175
All done.

456
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:04,114
Dr. Nathan, you ain't been up
to see Ginzburg lately.

457
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:05,748
No, l took a short
leave of absence.

458
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,725
l assumed Dr. Prestopnik
was examining him.

459
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,159
Prestopnik ain't
been up there one time.

460
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:12,220
Quit yapping, Deyell.

461
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:20,104
Again.

462
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:23,574
You've been having chills, night-sweats,
shortness of breath?

463
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:26,543
Yes, a trifecta.

464
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:29,012
l should probably transfer
you to the AlDS ward.

465
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:32,574
When l got the death penalty
for suffocating Antonio Nappa,

466
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,983
l thought,
''Oh, this'll be fun.''

467
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,988
Fun?

468
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:40,583
To see what kills me first--
the State or the disease.

469
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,923
Guess the disease
is winning.

470
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:14,256
Prisoner number 00K414,

471
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:18,353
Patrick Keenan;
convicted March 25, 2000;

472
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:23,163
assault
in the first degree, rape.

473
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:27,331
1 2 years,
up for parole in seven.

474
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,431
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Hey.

475
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:30,839
Have you met
Patrick Keenan?

476
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:32,935
No.

477
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:35,037
Patrick,
this is Ryan O'Reily.

478
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,809
l heard of you.

479
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:39,442
You and your brother used to run
the Bridget Street gang.

480
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:41,577
Yeah.

481
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,588
Boy, that's a--
that's a nice shamrock.

482
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:47,388
Yeah, thanks.
My lucky charm.

483
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:50,883
- So what did they catch you doing?
- Rape, assault.

484
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:54,057
- That so?
- Patrick's the one who did Dr. Nathan.

485
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,860
You raped Dr. Nathan?

486
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:00,269
- Yeah.
- Why?

487
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:03,103
l don't know.
l was in the mood.

488
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,201
He was ''in the mood.''
That right?

489
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,371
Hey, it's good to meet you
there, Keenan.

490
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,382
You and me, maybe we can get together
and do some business sometime.

491
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:15,011
l'd like that--
working for the O'Reily brothers.

492
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,078
Okay. See you.

493
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:30,528
Yeah...
Where're you going?

494
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,402
Hey, Goldilocks,
want to suck some chocolate?

495
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:35,838
No!

496
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,328
l'm switching him
to one milligram of Haldol.

497
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,067
- Are you sure?
- Well, what do you suggest? Counseling?

498
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,407
What the fuck is going
on, Adebisi?

499
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,078
Letting these assholes
fuck with my brother.

500
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,144
- We had a goddamn deal!
- Relax, O'Reily,

501
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,156
before you blow
a blood vessel.

502
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,624
l've already spoken
to Tidd and Browne.

503
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,456
- Haven't l?
- Yes.

504
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:32,019
- Brown?
- Yeah, man.

505
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:37,067
This type of bullshit
won't happen again.

506
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:39,833
Okay?

507
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:52,811
He all right?

508
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,819
They got him
so tanked up on Haldol

509
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:56,821
it's like he's
in a fucking coma.

510
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:59,085
ls that such
a bad thing?

511
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:06,958
O'Reily...
l got a question for you.

512
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,139
Stanislofky...

513
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,903
come here, sit.

514
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:23,111
l been playing catch-up
on a lot of what's been happening here.

515
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,640
Been reading the file
on the death of one Ralph Galino.

516
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:29,916
Tragic. Drugs very
serious problem.

517
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:33,287
Yeah. Except he had
no history of drugs,

518
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:36,294
- so how does he die of an O.D.?
- A mystery.

519
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,888
l understand you and Galino
didn't get along.

520
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,329
Who says that?

521
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,526
Did you ask me
a question?

522
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,127
Because you don't get
to ask me questions.

523
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,162
You are my main suspect
in Galino's death.

524
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,470
You are my
only suspect.

525
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:53,136
l'm gonna be
watching you,

526
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,544
perched like
a Czarist eagle.

527
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,289
You said
we should wait.

528
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,059
So we wait,
and look what happens.

529
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,693
O'Reily goes to the hacks
and tells them you and l killed Galino.

530
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,999
O'Reily said that?
You and me?

531
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:21,198
Yes.
So take care of him.

532
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,333
We whack O'Reily now,
they'll have all the proof they need.

533
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,435
No thanks.
l got a birthday coming up.

534
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,469
l don't want
to spend it in Solitary.

535
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,083
Look, l know that Russian cocksucker's
been talking smack about me, Jaz,

536
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:41,684
but you can't trust
that motherfucker.

537
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,286
l don't trust him.
l don't trust you neither.

538
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,127
Okay, fine. Only he's supposed
to be your pal, right?

539
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:49,429
l'll bet he hasn't told you
about the cell phone.

540
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,197
Cell phone?
What cell phone?

541
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,330
Ralph Galino's
cell phone.

542
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,896
- That's why he killed that wop.
- Shit.

543
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,374
Now who do
you trust?

544
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,776
What's going on?

545
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,475
Druke,
what is problem?

546
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:08,215
Cut the shit.

547
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,381
Give me
the cell phone.

548
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,516
Give it to me.

549
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,890
So what is going
to happen to me now?

550
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:25,000
l'm thinking...
maybe you die.

551
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,407
They're murdering me!
Guards!

552
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:30,999
Guards, guards!
Guards!

553
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,010
Break it up,
break it up.

554
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:35,035
Get up against the wall.
Get up back there!

555
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,642
Everybody's always
looking for an excuse.

556
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:43,779
''l killed
that man 'cause:

557
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,881
A) l was abused
as a child;

558
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:48,290
B) l had
shitty parents;

559
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,692
C) l was raised
in poverty;

560
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,390
D) All of the above.''

561
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:57,026
lf the only thing you know
from the cradle on up is violence...

562
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:59,036
what other choice
have you got?

563
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,095
- Fuck!
- Nyet!

564
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:05,308
What other reason
do you need?

565
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,231
Morning, Bob.

566
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:36,297
Bob, please.

567
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:39,242
When are you gonna stop
this silent treatment?

568
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:41,404
l said
l'm sorry

569
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:43,812
that l didn't tell you
l was building a new tunnel,

570
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:46,316
that l didn't ask you to escape with me.
What more can l do?

571
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,678
Count!

572
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:58,792
- How is he?
- Not good.

573
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,798
88K214, 77P326,

574
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:05,326
98K514, 97B41 2.

575
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:11,976
Hey, Beecher.
Get your ass out here.

576
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,444
Leave him alone.

577
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,208
- Beecher, now.
- You can see he's there.

578
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:19,148
Why does he have
to stand in line?

579
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:22,846
Rules is rules.

580
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,718
Fuck you.

581
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:26,986
- What?
- Fuck you. Fuck your rules.

582
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:31,987
Rebadow, l'd expect
Keller to be mouthy, but not you.

583
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,056
The man's children
have been kidnapped,

584
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,726
his son's hand
cut off.

585
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,168
Beecher's obviously in pain.
Why torture him more?

586
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,036
Right! Yeah!

587
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:44,132
Keep going.

588
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:46,769
- 96Q415, 18T304...
- All right, quiet down!

589
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,245
- Quiet down now!
- Who knew you had balls?

590
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,808
Shut the fuck up!

591
00:37:57,121 --> 00:38:00,215
A few years ago,
l was attacked by some of the black boys

592
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:03,625
- and landed in the hospital.
- l remember.

593
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,526
The bruises healed,

594
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:08,157
but l was flooded
with fear.

595
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,292
Well, that's
natural.

596
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:13,736
l hadn't felt such fear since
l was about to be executed

597
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,739
and then wasn't.

598
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:18,401
Killing Raul
Hernandez, as--

599
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:21,571
as terrible
as it was, as--

600
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,738
l don't know.
l feel alive.

601
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,510
l'm not afraid
to die.

602
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:52,602
- Teach me.
- Teach you what?

603
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,305
How to box.

604
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:56,643
You got to be
kidding me, right?

605
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,911
l want to learn
to defend myself.

606
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,817
Rebadow, l ain't got
the time or the interest. Take off.

607
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,685
- l can teach you.
- Cyril.

608
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:07,282
No, l can
if l want.

609
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:13,089
Okay.
First,

610
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,156
you gotta learn
how to stand.

611
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,360
Fucking Cyril.

612
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,408
Hey, Rebadow.

613
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:27,900
- Give me your pie, pops.
- No.

614
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:30,311
Oh, you're gonna
give me your pie,

615
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:33,249
or l'm gonna break
your old ass in two.

616
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:36,014
Okay.

617
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:44,017
You get pie!

618
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:48,860
How does
it taste, man?

619
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:56,271
You missed a great lunch,
but l got you something. Here.

620
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,275
Psst, psst--
Toby, take it.

621
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,470
Toby, you got
to eat something. Take it.

622
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,482
Take the fucking
orange and eat it. Come on.

623
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:15,785
Nothing like fresh-squeezed
orange juice.

624
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:19,292
Cell-mates--
it's like being married.

625
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,820
Rebadow still
ignoring you?

626
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:23,663
Worse. He's like
a different person.

627
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:26,602
lt's like when l was gone
some alien took over his body.

628
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,605
He certainly
has changed.

629
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,106
lt's
unsettling.

630
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:32,541
After a certain age,
people shouldn't change.

631
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:34,374
Shh. Here
he comes.

632
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:46,690
- Mr. Morales...
- Whoa. Slow down there, Rebadow.

633
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,214
l want to talk
to you.

634
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,659
Let him be,
Chico.

635
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,824
What do you
need?

636
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:02,238
When l agreed
to kill Hernandez,

637
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:04,639
you said in return
l could have anything l wanted.

638
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:07,439
True. And now you want me
to repay the debt?

639
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,673
Yes.

640
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:12,080
Okay. What can l
do for you?

641
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:14,710
l want you to let me
kill someone else.

642
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:32,963
Daddy!

643
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:40,403
Daddy?

644
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:42,605
Daddy?

645
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,233
He has these dreams
a lot?

646
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:05,861
Ever since his
kids got nabbed.

647
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:08,565
- Well, l'll speak to him.
- Sister Peter Marie, too.

648
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:10,904
Given her relationship
with Beecher,

649
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:13,001
she's being
rather...

650
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:15,012
casual
about all this.

651
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,674
That's not true.

652
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,582
l can't help thinking her distance
has something to do with me.

653
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:23,246
Well, shocking
as this seems, Keller,

654
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:26,188
not everything
on the planet has to do with you.

655
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:30,686
Keller's right.
lt is about him.

656
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:33,797
The doubts he put in my
mind about being a nun,

657
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,799
my effectiveness
as a psychologist--

658
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:38,802
But Pete,
Beecher needs you.

659
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,804
Ray, l know.

660
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,772
Do you remember
what l said to you a few weeks ago

661
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:45,139
about putting on a facade
so l could get through each day?

662
00:42:45,176 --> 00:42:49,112
- Sure.
- l am unable to comfort Tobias.

663
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,114
l mean, l--
l don't even look him in the eye,

664
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,413
because l know that
if l do, my facade will crumble.

665
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:58,854
So that-- that's worse than--
than no help to him.

666
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:10,634
Beecher hasn't been
out of his cell for two solid days.

667
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,468
He just lies
in his bunk

668
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,497
sobbing like
a wuss.

669
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:21,811
Good.

670
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:25,338
That's what's truly elegant
about this plan of mine.

671
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,851
We don't physically
touch Beecher,

672
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,513
and yet the damage
done is far more hideous.

673
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,315
Time to put parts
three and four into motion.

674
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:42,389
Hank?

675
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:45,527
Yeah. l want you
to drop off the other package.

676
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:48,265
Right. The one
we talked about.

677
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,297
Bye.

678
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:54,938
You should stop
smoking, Father.

679
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,879
l know, l know.
lt's bad for my health.

680
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:00,782
There's a law about
smoking in public places

681
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:03,150
- in state-owned buildings.
- ls this bothering you?

682
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:05,212
Yes!

683
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:09,521
Hello,
Tobias.

684
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,687
Thank you, Officer.
Wait outside, please.

685
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,597
Take a seat,
Toby.

686
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:17,624
l know what this
is about, Dad.

687
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:19,295
The FBl
found Gary?

688
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:20,895
Yes.

689
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:23,133
Gary's body.
He's dead.

690
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,404
Yes.

691
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:27,968
l knew.

692
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,274
l knew when l heard
about the hand.

693
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:35,983
And Holly?
Any news?

694
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,147
No, no.
Not yet.

695
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,953
l'd like to go
to Gary's funeral.

696
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:42,960
We've already made
arrangements.

697
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:45,053
l want him buried
right next to his mother.

698
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:47,530
l want to see the graves
l've dug lined up one next to the other.

699
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:49,897
Oh, Son.
Son.

700
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:01,409
lt's funny,
l can't cry.

701
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:05,812
l don't have
any more tears left.

702
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:26,570
Chris,
l want to

703
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:30,563
ask you
something.

704
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:33,441
l probably haven't asked you 'cause
l didn't want to know the answer.

705
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:36,173
l know you were married
all those times,

706
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,204
and l'm wondering
if l was the first--

707
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:40,240
you know,
the first man.

708
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,587
Well, l guess that
answers my question.

709
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,955
No.
No, it doesn't.

710
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:49,960
l just--

711
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:52,189
l think it's an odd conversation
for us to be having

712
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:54,220
right before you go
to your son's funeral.

713
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:58,725
The FBl says you're responsible
for a series of homosexual murders.

714
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,430
The FBl...

715
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,769
l'm not asking you to tell me if you
committed the murders.

716
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:06,334
l'm asking you if you've
ever felt this way with another man.

717
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:08,368
No.

718
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,571
l have not felt
this way.

719
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,280
l swear,
Toby.

720
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:17,981
You're lying.

721
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:21,150
- Toby, l'm not--
- You're lying.

722
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:56,854
Sweet dreams, baby.

723
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:13,902
Yes.

724
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:20,509
Ah, come in. Sit.
Thanks, Officer.

725
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:21,950
Smoke?

726
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:24,420
They're bad
for you.

727
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:30,752
Shirley Bellinger,
before she was executed,

728
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,922
gave me a little hint as to who
impregnated her when she was in Oz.

729
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:36,524
She said,
''Neither rain nor snow,''

730
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,558
which l believe is part
of the old motto

731
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:40,832
of the U.S.
Postal Service.

732
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:42,862
Since you deliver
the mail to death row,

733
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,932
l'm figuring she was telling me
that you were the father.

734
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:47,637
Well, you're wrong.

735
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:49,805
l never had sex
with Shirley.

736
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:52,281
Not that l didn't
want to.

737
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:56,350
Even if you had been right,
what's it matter? She's dead.

738
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:59,185
l don't know you,
Schillinger.

739
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:03,550
l don't know what you're capable of.
l know your reputation...

740
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:06,495
of course.

741
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,327
But even so, l find it
hard to believe

742
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:10,731
that you would cut the hand
off a small child,

743
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:12,736
that you would
kill a boy

744
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,170
who never
hurt a soul.

745
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:17,800
l never did anything
to Beecher's kid.

746
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,107
l'm gonna tell you
something now.

747
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:25,172
Beecher is the one
who found your son Hank.

748
00:48:25,216 --> 00:48:26,945
l know.

749
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:29,714
You know.

750
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:31,721
Yeah, he did it
to fuck with me,

751
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:34,155
- the same way he did with Andrew.
- No.

752
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:37,058
He did it to make up
for what happened to Andrew.

753
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:39,688
He did it in the hopes
of putting the anger

754
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,698
that exists between you
behind you.

755
00:48:41,732 --> 00:48:44,326
This l swear to you
on my vow as a priest.

756
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,860
lf l'm lying to you,
may l be damned for all time.

757
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:53,543
Schillinger,

758
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:56,375
don't let anything
happen to Beecher's daughter.

759
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:01,577
lf you have any decency
left inside you,

760
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,814
lf you--

761
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:06,823
if you have
a soul,

762
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:10,156
you'll let that girl
go free.

763
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:27,803
All right. So you asked me
to do a little digging, right?

764
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:31,144
So l dug here, nothing.
l dug there, zip.

765
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:34,082
But then,
a gusher.

766
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:36,086
- Tell me.
- ''Tell me''?

767
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,020
l got valuable
information

768
00:49:38,055 --> 00:49:40,046
and we haven't even
negotiated a price.

769
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:43,321
- How much?
- Hey, l got kids too, all right?

770
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,328
My youngest,
Tabitha,

771
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:47,489
she needs massive amounts
of dental work.

772
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,158
That poor girl's teeth are fucked up,
man. They're all rotted out.

773
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,259
Zabitz...
Please, not now.

774
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:55,761
All right. But you
pay the dental bills,

775
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:57,034
every last one
of them.

776
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:59,133
Okay.

777
00:49:59,176 --> 00:50:01,406
Just tell me what you know
about the kidnapping.

778
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:09,310
According to a very reliable
source on the outside,

779
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:11,719
this was
a job for hire.

780
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:16,124
The actual perp's name
is Bob ''Big Butt'' Towland.

781
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,924
Who hired him?

782
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:22,295
- l hesitate.
- Why?

783
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:25,200
Because it's someone
l understand

784
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:27,863
is very near
and dear to you.

785
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:29,736
Who, for
Christ's sake?

786
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,901
Chris Keller.

787
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:34,911
Can you be
sure of this?

788
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:38,574
l'm as sure as anybody can be
about anything.

789
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,592
l need you
to find out the truth.

790
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:57,862
That's my job.

791
00:50:57,901 --> 00:50:59,869
He's done a lot
of fucked-up things to me, but this...

792
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:02,565
makes no sense.

793
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:04,403
Guys like Keller
are hunters.

794
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:08,634
They kill
for sport.

795
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:19,346
You think you're a
pretty cool customer, huh?

796
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,153
Well...

797
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:23,455
let's just say l spent my share of time
in interrogations.

798
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,498
You ever hear of a fellow
by the name of

799
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:30,523
Mark Karachi?

800
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:35,971
- No.
- Byam Lewis?

801
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,406
- Nope.
- How about Bryce Tibbetts?

802
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:40,706
No, no and no.

803
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:42,837
All three of these men
were homosexuals.

804
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,610
All three hung out
in the same gay bar.

805
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:47,139
All three
turned up dead.

806
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:50,176
That is, after they were
sodomized and tortured.

807
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,745
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

808
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,281
But here's
what's curious.

809
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,850
You moved to the city
in December of '97.

810
00:51:57,895 --> 00:51:59,920
These men were killed

811
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:02,431
in January, March
and May of '98.

812
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:05,663
You got sent
to Oz in June of that year.

813
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:08,933
Suddenly
the killings stopped.

814
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:11,566
What a bizarre
coincidence.

815
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:21,507
We know
you're guilty.

816
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:24,621
You got proof?

817
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:26,782
Evidence?
Witnesses?

818
00:52:26,824 --> 00:52:29,691
You frequented
the same gay bar.

819
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:33,025
Oh. Well, you know,
that doesn't make me a murderer

820
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:34,428
any more than it
makes me a fag.

821
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:36,990
And yet you are,
aren't you? A fag?

822
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:41,263
- You suck Tobias Beecher's cock.
- He sucks mine.

823
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:44,468
From what l hear, you and he have had
a pretty bumpy courtship, huh?

824
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:46,601
Lots of pain
inflicted on both sides.

825
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:49,578
You in on this
latest round?

826
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:52,849
l don't
follow you.

827
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:54,851
The death
of his son.

828
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:58,150
Me kill his son?
You're joking, right?

829
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:01,123
Now when have you ever
known the FBl to joke?

830
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:05,718
Lights out!

831
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:13,732
How you doing?

832
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,965
You've been
very quiet today.

833
00:53:19,977 --> 00:53:22,172
Let me ask you
something.

834
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,681
What should l do
if l ever find out who killed Gary?

835
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:29,944
You should whack him.

836
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:31,955
l'd help you.

837
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:33,820
Yeah?

838
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:35,848
- Well, that'd be my pleasure.
- What the fuck?!

839
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:39,318
You murdered
my son!

840
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:47,132
Get the fuck
off him!

841
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,637
You think
l'd do that?!

842
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:50,640
You're capable
of fucking anything!

843
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:03,049
You bitch!

844
00:54:11,428 --> 00:54:13,726
- l'm here for my money.
- Pay him.

845
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,734
- You got a kid with rotten teeth?
- Yeah.

846
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:21,067
You should see her mouth, man.
Nothing but decay.

847
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,666
Genetics...

848
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,644
or environment?

849
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:31,580
Like in everything else,
society searches...

850
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:34,584
for the ''magic bullet''--
the easy answer,

851
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:36,779
'cause the more complex
the answer is,

852
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,913
the more terrified
we become.

853
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:41,254
ls the root of violence

854
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:44,283
much deeper,
much darker?

855
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:46,296
How about...

856
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,298
''pure evil''?

857
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,463
Maybe we human creatures
are inherently evil.

858
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:55,562
Maybe evil
is ingrained,

859
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:59,064
embedded
in our souls.

860
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:01,077
Flip Wilson
used to joke,

861
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:03,409
''The Devil
made me do it.''

862
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:05,745
Maybe he
was right.

863
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:08,250
Or maybe not.

864
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,582
Hello, Hank?
Yeah.

865
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,254
l want you to drop off
the other package

866
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:21,628
at the grandparents'
house.

867
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:24,532
No... alive.
