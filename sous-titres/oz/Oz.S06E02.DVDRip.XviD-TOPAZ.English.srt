1
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,693
Ask any towheaded schoolboy
how many senses we got,

2
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,757
and it's likely
they're gonna say five.

3
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,964
Five?
Are you kiddin' me?

4
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,973
What about my sense of balance,
entitlement, fair play?

5
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,841
Problem is five is about the most
our tiny little brains can handle.

6
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,678
But sometimes we have so many
senses cluttering us up,

7
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,344
so many ways to feel
about a thing, we blow a fuse.

8
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,580
And what's
that lead to?

9
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,816
Senseless violence.

10
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,655
Yeah, senseless violence...

11
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,490
it comes in all shapes
and colors.

12
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,396
For a second day, riots have rocked
the east side of the city,

13
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,696
ignited by Governor Devlin's
comment

14
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,964
that he would pardon
Mayor Wilson Loewen

15
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,734
if Loewen is convicted
for his role in the 1963 murder

16
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,606
of two small
African-American girls.

17
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,338
In response
to the rioting,

18
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,403
city schools
and offices are closed.

19
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,780
All state correctional facilities
are under tight security.

20
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,285
A verdict is expected
sometime this week.

21
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,351
Guard, guard!

22
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,054
No!

23
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,494
Your father was stabbed
with an ice-pick...

24
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,727
once in the back,
several times in the stomach.

25
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,496
Who? Who murdered
my dad?

26
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,029
We're investigating,

27
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,268
searching cells for evidence,
for the murder weapon.

28
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,538
Man, this is bullshit.

29
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,152
I-I want to go
to the funeral.

30
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,589
I'm sorry. We can't permit that.
We're in lockdown.

31
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,424
But, Warden,
my parole hearing is tomorrow

32
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,292
and there's
a fairly good chance

33
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,820
that I'm gonna
go free anyway.

34
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,834
Because of the riots
your hearing's been postponed.

35
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,465
Guess what we found.

36
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,602
But why would Clarence Seroy
kill my father?

37
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,874
I don't know Seroy.
It makes no sense.

38
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,814
This is Oz, Beecher,
nothing makes sense.

39
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,646
Maybe it's these riots.

40
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,812
There's a lot of
racial tension out there.

41
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,256
No, more likely
the Aryans hired Seroy

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,660
or planted the ice-pick
in his cell to throw Glynn off.

43
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,665
This is fucking
Schillinger's doing.

44
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,191
Killing Beecher's father,
man, what a rush.

45
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,329
It's better than
a case of Red Bull.

46
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,568
The fuckin' hacks haven't
a clue who did the deed.

47
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,001
Hey, Clarence!
How's it going?

48
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,036
Man, this is bullshit.

49
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,049
They'll never figure out
who really did it... -

50
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,311
Shut the fuck up!

51
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,911
The jury found Mayor
Wilson Loewen guilty

52
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,545
of murder in
the second degree.

53
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,556
Fuck!

54
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,490
I believe
that Mayor Loewen is innocent

55
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,899
and I believe that this trial
was a mockery of justice.

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,427
However, due to the volatility
of the situation,

57
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,805
I will not pardon him.

58
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,003
I won't pardon him, yet.

59
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,036
We'll let the smoke clear,
wait a few months,

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,877
then we'll
get him out.

61
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,382
Why send him here?

62
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,477
Put Loewen in a nice cushy
minimum security prison

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,283
like Hecht
or MacArthur.

64
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,880
That won't
placate the mob.

65
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,447
They want the mayor
to suffer.

66
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,484
The most important thing
is to keep him safe.

67
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:59,430
What's the safest place
in this charnel-house?

68
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,195
Unit "J"...primarily
we put bad cops there

69
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,329
so they don't face retaliation
by the rest of the community.

70
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,271
Who's in that
cell block now?

71
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,207
Alvin Yood,
Tobias Beecher.

72
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,210
Are either
of them black?

73
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,572
- No.
- Okay.

74
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,743
Well, hear this.

75
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:23,017
Wilson Loewen
is my friend.

76
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,321
If anything happens to him,
Leo... anything...

77
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,851
I will burn this building
to the ground.

78
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,742
- Mayor Loewen.
- Hello, Leo.

79
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,677
The last time I saw you was
at the big fundraiser in Morrisville,

80
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,080
back when you were running
for lieutenant governor.

81
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,584
We brought in a shitload
of cash that night, huh?

82
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,787
I was disappointed when
you dropped out of the race.

83
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,690
I always thought you had
the makings of a fine politician.

84
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,457
Look, whatever relationship
we may have had in the past,

85
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,056
that's over.
You're my prisoner now.

86
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,193
That simple, huh?

87
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,830
Or do you think I actually
killed those little girls?

88
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,670
You were found guilty.

89
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,266
Well, as a black man

90
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,301
you ought to know
that don't mean dick.

91
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,779
Take His Honor
to Unit "J."

92
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,805
Thank you, friend.

93
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,885
The streets are
once again calm,

94
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,449
though the damage to the east
side due to the rioting

95
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,655
is estimated at $13.7 million.

96
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,687
Lockdown is over!

97
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,323
About fuckin' time.

98
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,357
Phelan, where'd they
put Wilson Loewen?

99
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,200
Don't know.
Probably Unit "J."

100
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,069
"J"? Shit.

101
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,166
- Let me the fuck out!
- Shut up, Cutler! I'm coming.

102
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,177
Beecher's in "J."

103
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,908
He'll try to hurt the mayor
to get back at me.

104
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,439
I want you to put
the word out, Winthrop.

105
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,678
I want Beecher to know

106
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,983
he better not touch a hair
on the old man's head.

107
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,417
We were in the Oval Office
and the President says to me,

108
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,224
"Wilson,
if it weren't for you,

109
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,128
I wouldn't be sitting
in this chair."

110
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,224
And he gave me
these cufflinks. See?

111
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,235
Got the presidential
seal on them.

112
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,032
Mr. Mayor, you're
the only one I know

113
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,402
with a bigger
appetite than me.

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,307
Appetite...
yeah, for power.

115
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,367
I hear you're not gonna
resign from office.

116
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,538
You're forcing City Council
to vote you out?

117
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,640
Well, the honorable
James Michael Curley

118
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,084
served the good people of Boston
while he was incarcerated.

119
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,554
Hell, he even won re-election
while sitting in stir.

120
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,682
I could do the same thing.
The people love me.

121
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,716
- I might run for governor.
- Hell, why not run for God?

122
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,198
What the hell?

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,744
Oh, Jesus.

124
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,709
How are you doin',
can you talk?

125
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,721
Oh yeah,
I'm all right.

126
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,383
I just... choked on...

127
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,394
He gave him
the Heimlich maneuver.

128
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,259
He... he what?

129
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,821
Beecher saved
Loewen's life.

130
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,661
What does Schillinger
want with me?

131
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,402
I think it's better
if he tells you himself.

132
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,410
I don't want to hear
anymore of his lies.

133
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,469
You know, this is
probably just some trap

134
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,481
to fuck with
my parole hearing tomorrow.

135
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,710
I'll admit Schillinger
has conned me in the past,

136
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,379
same as you, but l...
this time it's different.

137
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,856
Beecher.

138
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,362
What do you want?

139
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,332
Wilson Loewen has always
been there for my family...

140
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,132
for me.

141
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,638
When my pop
couldn't find work,

142
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,335
he gave him a job
in the Parks Department.

143
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,844
When Martha and I
couldn't afford a honeymoon,

144
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,176
he gave us
airline tickets.

145
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,479
The man is my hero.
You saved his life.

146
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,508
I am now
indebted to you.

147
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,654
So I want you to know

148
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,158
that I won't do anything
to try and stop your parole.

149
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,325
If you can get out
of this fuckhole... go.

150
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,994
Bullshit.

151
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,701
Whatever you're selling,
Vern, I'm not buying.

152
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,403
- You grateful to me?
- It's true.

153
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,675
True?

154
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,410
I can give you a list
as big as my tattooed ass

155
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,441
of things you said were true.

156
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,510
- Do I have to stay here?
- No.

157
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,517
Beecher, if my backing off
wasn't what you were after,

158
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,185
why'd you save Loewen?

159
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,025
Because I saw
a man dying...

160
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,623
and my instinct was
to save his life,

161
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,693
my gut instinct.

162
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,935
After all these years in Oz,
I still have that instinct.

163
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,001
That's something you
don't know shit about.

164
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,277
Due to recent circumstances...
the death of your father,

165
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,443
your saving
a fellow inmate's life,

166
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,045
as well as your continued
outstanding behavior,

167
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:26,081
the board has decided
to grant you parole.

168
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,822
You're a free man,
Mr. Beecher.

169
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,023
The processing
takes a few days,

170
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,932
but for all intents
and purposes you are free.

171
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,603
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

172
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,518
Pinch me, Sister.
I'm dreaming again.

173
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,820
No, Tobias,

174
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,885
you are not dreaming.

175
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,625
- Oh oh oh, my goodness.
- Holy fucking Christ!

176
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,463
Oh my God!

177
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,927
Oh my God.

178
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,433
Lopresti, my lawyer was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

179
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,604
Can you call down
and find out what's going on?

180
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,013
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

181
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,541
I got good news
and I got bad news...

182
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,679
The bad news is
Beecher's father's dead.

183
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,687
No.

184
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,889
The day we went into lockdown,
murdered right down the hall.

185
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,295
I guess that puts
a kink in your appeal.

186
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,595
What's the good news?

187
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,400
Your girlfriend
got paroled.

188
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,370
That's right,
Beecher's going home,

189
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,744
and from what I hear,
he's in such a hurry to leave,

190
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,547
he won't even have time
to come say bye-bye.

191
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,886
You know
what they say?

192
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,126
When one of
your senses fails,

193
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,600
the other ones compensate
by getting stronger.

194
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,535
Like if you go blind,

195
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,869
your hearing
suddenly perks up.

196
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,875
Can't smell?
Your tastebuds bloom.

197
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,605
So what happens
if you lost them all,

198
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,876
if things no longer
make any sense?

199
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,284
You've got to rely on others
to get you through the day,

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,950
and in Oz
that could be dangerous.

201
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,186
Rise and shine,
you little fucks!

202
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,752
Get up!

203
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,354
I can't, I'm sick.

204
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,092
Bullshit.

205
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,533
If you think you're taking
a siesta in the hospital

206
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,935
just 'cause White did, you're in
for a rude awakening.

207
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,837
Now get the fuck up!

208
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,537
Jesus!

209
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,209
Claire, we got
a problem over here.

210
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,948
What the fuck
is this, Ebola?

211
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,526
Fuck you, Martinez.

212
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,586
Yeah yeah,
cha-cha-cha yourself, Carlos.

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,325
Fuck you, all right?

214
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,356
You better calm down,
Mr. Martinez,

215
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,197
or I will put you
in restraints.

216
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,363
What is he, the nurse's pet?

217
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,033
Glynn, Nathan won't
give me more painkillers.

218
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,804
So?
Call the A.M.A.

219
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,682
What's the emergency?

220
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,619
Penders, White and Martinez have
methylene chloride poisoning.

221
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,021
- Did someone poison them?
- Not someone, us.

222
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,652
- What?
- Oz itself.

223
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,595
Methylene chloride's
found in aerosols,

224
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,929
paint removers, metal cleaning
products, polyurethane...

225
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,959
basically everything
that was used to rebuild this place.

226
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,166
- Guess where the residue settled?
- In solitary.

227
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,902
Shit.

228
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,433
So what's the prognosis?

229
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,607
Well, when caught early, treatable
respiratory and gastric problems,

230
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:14,085
but these guys, it's all they've been
breathing in 24 hours a day.

231
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,986
Martinez's
liver is shot.

232
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,149
Penders and White
have lung damage,

233
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,887
and to say nothing of
the neurophysiological effects.

234
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,986
These guys are
gonna get crazy?

235
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,860
Or it may
make them sane.

236
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,061
But Martinez needs treatment
I can't provide.

237
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,535
I'd like to send him
to Benchley Memorial.

238
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,466
No.

239
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,705
Well, he'll get
better care.

240
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,340
For the moment
let's keep this close to home.

241
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,408
I don't think we need
to spread the word just yet

242
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,352
that Oz is toxic.

243
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,378
Well, then I want
to go on record.

244
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,946
You're a good doctor,
Gloria.

245
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,585
You saved Pancamo after
he caught a staph infection.

246
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,118
We didn't go public
with that, did we?

247
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:01,258
I have faith that you'll pull
these guys through too.

248
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,292
- Don't you knock?
- Sorry.

249
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,194
Didn't think you'd be doing
anything that needed knocking.

250
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,460
I'm here to transfer
Martinez back to solitary.

251
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,160
He's not going back
to solitary...

252
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,566
- That's what the paperwork says.
- I don't care.

253
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,798
Unless you get Glynn
to tell me different,

254
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,102
- Martinez is going.
- I'll be right back.

255
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,967
Excuse me.

256
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,613
So...

257
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,815
what ails you,
Martinez, huh?

258
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,017
You gonna die?

259
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,218
Oh, I love it
when you go all silent on me.

260
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,495
But I don't want
you to die,

261
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,526
at least not till you tell me
who paid you to cut my tendon.

262
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,731
And you will tell me,
Carlos,

263
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,502
'cause I have friends
in solitary.

264
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,373
When you get back there
they're gonna...

265
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,176
I have the warden on the phone
in my office, line three.

266
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,308
Buenas noches,
mi amigo.

267
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,748
Hey hey,

268
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,486
you two make
a really cute pair!

269
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,422
Jackhammer
Miss Sally style.

270
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,027
And side, and side,
and three.

271
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,230
Add more and do-si-do,
and four and five,

272
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,330
and side,
and two and three...

273
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,365
This is the best
Miss Sally ever.

274
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,309
And jump it out
and work those legs...

275
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,006
Officer Murphy,
I got an ask.

276
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,038
I'm in no mood
to be tender, Morales.

277
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,142
I want to shift jobs.
I've been working at mechanical

278
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,745
- since I got to Oz. I need a change.
- To where?

279
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,449
I'm thinking hospital.

280
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,355
I got a couple of pals
who are orderlies.

281
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,121
I thought maybe
I could do some good.

282
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,219
Some good for yourself,
you mean.

283
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,889
What do you think,
I'm an idiot?

284
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,488
Your pal Martinez
is in the ward

285
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,023
recuperating from something
he caught in solitary.

286
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,060
Carlos is in the hospital?
I didn't know that.

287
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,504
I made it a priority of mine
to keep you and Martinez

288
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,440
as far away from
each other as possible,

289
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,204
that is until Martinez admits

290
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,973
that you ordered him
to attack Dave Brass.

291
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,809
That old song
of yours again?

292
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,644
Yeah, when he does that,
you're doing down.

293
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,378
You're going down down down
to the lowest pit with no bottom.

294
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,683
Fine, I'll ask McManus
for the transfer.

295
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,086
- You go do that.
- I will.

296
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,056
- Yeah. Bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

297
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,492
What if Martinez
jabbers on me?

298
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,401
He hasn't yet.
He never will.

299
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,396
Now and never is not
the same thing, Chico.

300
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,239
Being in solitary
can wear a man down,

301
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,973
and if Carlos is sick

302
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,141
the hacks are withholding
medicines until he turns.

303
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,083
What could we do?

304
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,245
Kill him.

305
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,822
Enrique, no,
he's one of us.

306
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,917
Yeah, but for how long?

307
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
Lights out!

308
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,590
A lot of times when
a woman gets pregnant,

309
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,467
her sense of smell
changes for the worse.

310
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,065
Suddenly roses
are putrid,

311
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,976
and freshly-baked bread,
Jeez, it's more like ammonia.

312
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,775
Epileptics got
something similar.

313
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,079
They can often tell when
they're about to do a backflip,

314
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,678
because they start to smell
things that aren't there,

315
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,052
so at least they got
a chance to sit down

316
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,922
before the seizure hits.

317
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,927
With pregnancy
and epilepsy,

318
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,590
you've got a pretty good
sense of impending doom.

319
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,465
Too bad we've got no sense
of how to avoid it.

320
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,904
I'm here to work,
Stella.

321
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,911
Hi, Robert.
Give me a hand?

322
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,313
I'll need you to take
the book cart around today.

323
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,309
- William Blake.
- That's right.

324
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,017
- It's the cover to...
- "Songs of Experience."

325
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,489
I never expected to find
a Blake fan in here.

326
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,659
I'm sorry, I have to ask:
Why are you here?

327
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,669
Why would you work in Oz
as opposed to some city library

328
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,365
where you wouldn't be
surprised to find a Blake fan?

329
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:39,070
Well... one day
about a year ago

330
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,705
I was home taking a shower
and I heard a noise.

331
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,647
I came out of
the bathroom,

332
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,150
and there was this kid
standing in the hallway

333
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,915
with my DVD player.

334
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,283
There I am, au naturel,

335
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,125
and though I consider
my body a beautiful sight,

336
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,596
the kid freaks
and jumps out the window.

337
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,362
He twists his ankle. A couple
of minutes later the police pick him up.

338
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,428
It seems he's robbed
other people as well.

339
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:11,306
So I go downtown to testify
at some pretrial thing,

340
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,746
and there's
the kid, Germaine...

341
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,444
so small, so sweet...
sitting next to his mother.

342
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,884
I think,
"He's going to jail."

343
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,152
Then I think, "Christ, he can have
my DVD player."

344
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,056
You could have
dropped the charges.

345
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,358
I did, but everyone else
held firm.

346
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,887
I went and visited Germaine
at juvenile detention

347
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,196
and I said to him,
"Why aren't you in school?"

348
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,829
- And you know what he told me?
- He couldn't read.

349
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,236
It broke my heart.

350
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,902
I went to Plymouth House

351
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,471
every week and taught him,

352
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,678
and he took to words
like a plant to rain.

353
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,519
His mind was so sharp,
so alive, so thirsty.

354
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,955
That's wonderful.

355
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,721
He got stabbed and died.

356
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,759
And even though
I knew there were

357
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,663
others like him
in Plymouth,

358
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,258
I couldn't go back.

359
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,435
I also knew I couldn't
stop what I'd started.

360
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,773
So... ta-da!

361
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,576
You came to a place filled
with old books and bad attitudes.

362
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,741
The truth is, Robert,

363
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,512
every book
on these shelves

364
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,348
is new to someone
who hasn't read it.

365
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,546
You know Blake,
he said,

366
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,027
"There is a moment in each day
that Satan cannot find."

367
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,961
That's right.

368
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,657
You know what
my ultimate goal is?

369
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,794
To make that moment
last a lifetime.

370
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,377
Hey, Rebadow, man,
I'll take a novel.

371
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,849
- Which one?
- I don't know.

372
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,379
A long one.
I'm out of toilet paper.

373
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,991
Hey, Agamemnon,
recommend something?

374
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,398
You got any pop-up books?
I love pop-up books.

375
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,596
- No.
- Then I'm not interested.

376
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,400
Reading confuses me.

377
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,569
Agamemnon.

378
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,874
I know what you're gonna ask.
The answer is no.

379
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,006
Come on.

380
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,380
This is the third straight
visiting day Norma's come.

381
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,180
Then tell her to stop.

382
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,120
I've got nothing to say to the woman
who left me at the altar

383
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,419
and then wham, boom,
shows up a couple of months later

384
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,016
carrying some other Joe's child.

385
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,323
Don't you even want to know
if she's doing okay?

386
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,798
- If the child is?
- Well, I'm assuming they are.

387
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,800
Fine, assume away.

388
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,564
Why, is there
something wrong?

389
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,897
Stop yanking
my chain, McManus.

390
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,774
- Is Norma all right?
- Ask her yourself.

391
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,183
So Norma was here
again today?

392
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,743
So we're both in prison?

393
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,415
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

394
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,083
I thought we were
asking questions

395
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,888
that we already knew
the answers to.

396
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,087
I think you should see her.

397
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,893
I was talking
to Stella about it and...

398
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,865
What's Stella have
to do with anything?

399
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,061
She's a very
smart woman.

400
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,128
She reminded me
of a Blake passage:

401
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,231
"Some are born
to sweet delight,

402
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,299
Some are born
to endless night..."

403
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,073
Oh, I get it, I get it.
You're sweet, I'm endless.

404
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,342
No, that's not
my point at all.

405
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,009
What Blake is saying is
that every day you're born

406
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,314
and it's your choice.

407
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,050
See? This is why
I like pop-up books.

408
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,855
There's a condition
called synesthesia.

409
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,891
It makes you associate
letters with colors,

410
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,062
sounds with touch.

411
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,564
Imagine reading a book
and being constantly awash

412
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,907
in a cascade
of green and purple,

413
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,277
or hearing a guitar chord

414
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:13,273
and feeling it like your lover's lips
against your neck.

415
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,412
Why they call it a condition
I'll never know.

416
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,016
It sounds more
like a blessing,

417
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:24,188
and just goes to prove that
even the most basic reality

418
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,721
is totally different
for each of us.

419
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:35,395
Belial, bring back the spirits
of those who have gone before,

420
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,567
those dark
and troublesome souls

421
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,169
that spent the last hours
of their lives on death row.

422
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,510
Kirk, you scum fuck,
quit that shit!

423
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,981
Praise Hell.
Praise Satan.

424
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,951
Oh, Mukada, you gotta
get Kirk to stop.

425
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,753
He's driving me
fuckin' crazy.

426
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,817
Believe me,
that's why I'm here.

427
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,029
Somehow I knew
we'd meet again.

428
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,965
You wrote a letter
to the cardinal

429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,434
claiming that
I sexually abused you.

430
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:08,166
You touched my penis.
You licked my ear.

431
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,673
That's a lie.

432
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,144
I have a meeting later this week
with the Archdiocese and the cops.

433
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,638
I'm gonna tell them
all the "sin-sational" details.

434
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,513
By lying,

435
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,485
you tarnish
the legitimate grievances

436
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,988
of the men and boys who have
been abused by the clergy,

437
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,614
and you do harm
to the many priests

438
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,989
who have lived celibate
and spiritual lives.

439
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,391
According to Nostradamus,

440
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,156
the Roman Church
is almost ready to fall.

441
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,289
I want you
to tell the truth.

442
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,593
Let me at him!

443
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,124
I'll squeeze the truth out of
his scrawny little neck.

444
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,331
Hoyt, you'd think by now you'd
realize that's not the answer.

445
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,738
He's gonna die anyway.
What's the difference how?

446
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,799
You asked me to perform
an exorcism

447
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,811
to free you from
the devil's hold.

448
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,472
I don't know
how to do that,

449
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,640
but I've contacted
an expert who's a priest...

450
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,243
Too late, Mukada,
as always... too late.

451
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,488
When I am executed,

452
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,756
you will be stripped
of your ministry,

453
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,491
you will be abandoned
by Holy Mother Church

454
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,829
and you will spend
the rest of your days

455
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,768
wandering aimlessly
and without hope.

456
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,664
In death...

457
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,540
I will be
triumphant.

458
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,970
A fashion layout?

459
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,875
Yes.

460
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,075
- With the prisoners on death row?
- Yes.

461
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,016
- In "Maxim" magazine?
- Yes.

462
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,578
And why do you think
this is such a good idea?

463
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,614
The governor's press secretary
believes a photo op

464
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,058
will give a positive spin
to the prison system.

465
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,154
It seems,
I don't know,

466
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,597
unethical.

467
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,694
Or for the boys on death row,
a last hurrah.

468
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,273
This thing is gonna
work like so...

469
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,835
Each of you clowns is gonna
be photographed individually

470
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,210
in various sets of clothes,

471
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,307
and then a group shot.
Questions?

472
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,581
- When's the magazine come out?
- January.

473
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,520
Oh, good, I'll be able
to see it.

474
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,355
- My execution isn't until April.
- Great.

475
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,263
Okay, good.
Let me see a little smile.

476
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,664
Okay, good.
That's good.

477
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,228
Hey, ladies.

478
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,666
- Okay, big smile.
- Jericho can smile.

479
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,077
That's good.

480
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,274
I need to change the glass tube
in that lamp.

481
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,875
Okay, great.

482
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,018
Let's get this
over with.

483
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,490
Okay, we're ready
for the group shot.

484
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,761
Let me get you
right behind him.

485
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,596
Let's have you
in the back.

486
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,730
Let's get you
behind him also.

487
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:31,435
You and me, Jazbo,
captured on film for posterity.

488
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,535
Hey, great, guys.
That's good.

489
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,569
And look butch.

490
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,744
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit!

491
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,258
This time you die,
motherfucker!

492
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,279
I just got a call
from the Vicar-General.

493
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,305
Because Kirk is dead,

494
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,374
Monsignor Slon
has convinced the police

495
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,352
to drop the investigation
against me.

496
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,580
- You're back.
- Yes.

497
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,951
My prayers
have been answered.

498
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,887
Pete...

499
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,666
I prayed for Kirk to die.

500
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,884
I just finished reading
Augustus Hill's memoirs.

501
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,689
It's remarkable, isn't it?

502
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,925
You know, the way he describes
people and the way things work,

503
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,592
it's the best book about prison life
I've read in years.

504
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,124
I completely agree.

505
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,469
- Yeah, so what do we do with it?
- Well...

506
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,599
I've just taken
the liberty of sending

507
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,110
the pages along
to my publisher.

508
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,203
He wants to publish.

509
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,748
That's terrific.

510
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,580
Have you told Redding
about it?

511
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,154
I tried.

512
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,953
He didn't seem
to hear me.

513
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,701
Oh, fuck.

514
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,866
There he goes again,
going around in circles.

515
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,910
Hey yo, Burr, man,
you gonna be done soon?

516
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,845
We trying to ball.

517
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,543
Great, not only ain't
he focused on business,

518
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,712
he gone deaf too.

519
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,750
I'm telling you, man,

520
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,658
that old
motherfucker's done.

521
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,221
We need young blood
to run the tribe.

522
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,630
You, man.

523
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,157
I ain't no
number one, yo.

524
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,603
I already tried it on
and the shoe does not fit.

525
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,197
Then who?

526
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,210
Till we figure
that out, bro,

527
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,508
we're stuck with
old Burr here.

528
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,313
Oh, yes!

529
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,524
Yes...

530
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,555
In these tough times,
it's essential

531
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,067
for the state government
to work hand in hand

532
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,469
with business to create
new economic opportunities.

533
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,963
Today I am pleased
to announce

534
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,034
that privately-owned
enterprises

535
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,173
will be set up inside
our penitentiaries,

536
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,013
employing prisoners
full time

537
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,042
on a merit basis.

538
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:06,420
The first programs will be
set up in the Oswald

539
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,722
and Parker Women's
Correctional Facilities.

540
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,922
Oh, shit.

541
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,023
Said,

542
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,092
I've been thinking
about what you said,

543
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,731
how I'm a leader
who does not truly lead.

544
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,732
I've been dwelling on all the shit
that I done caused.

545
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,278
I got Augustus killed.

546
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,078
I got young boys
out there slinging tits.

547
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,209
Well, I can't
do it anymore,

548
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,220
and I won't let them
do it either.

549
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,882
I'm very happy
to hear that.

550
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,721
I got this idea,

551
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,559
but I need to talk
to McManus upstairs.

552
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,793
But Burr Redding, he ain't
got much credibility anymore.

553
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,529
So what do you want me to do,
go see him for you?

554
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,003
I want you
to be there with me.

555
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,700
Your presence is gonna
give me voice.

556
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,810
Okay. But what's
your idea?

557
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,610
Well, in order to get my boys
to stop selling them tits,

558
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,549
I gotta give them
an alternative.

559
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,484
We're gonna
get real jobs.

560
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,225
The young lady at the other end
of the table is Donna Degenhart.

561
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,696
She's the owner of this
new enterprise in Oz. Donna?

562
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,562
Thanks to all of you
in advance

563
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,499
for helping me
create my company.

564
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,833
- What exactly is your company?
- Telemarketing.

565
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,101
I'll hire inmates
to man phone banks

566
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,938
and control databases
for businesses on the outside.

567
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,637
Like who?

568
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,613
Long-distance providers,
public-opinion pollsters,

569
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,241
charities, airline reservations...
you name it.

570
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,810
You do this, what happens
to Kentwell Communications?

571
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,290
- I'm sorry?
- The telemarketing company.

572
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,588
Well, we're not putting
anyone out of business.

573
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,287
The market can bear
two companies.

574
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,820
And you know this through
your extensive experience?

575
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,390
I know this because
36 other states

576
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,231
have implemented
similar programs,

577
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,830
and the benefits inside far outweigh
any small complications

578
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,001
- that may arise outside.
- Oh... gee.

579
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,501
Seems I hear that every time
we kick-start something.

580
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,741
And how often does that
work out for us?

581
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,240
For Christ's sakes, do you got stock
in Kentwell communications?

582
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,083
No, a brother.

583
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,456
We want to get involved
in this new business that's coming in.

584
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,330
So fill out
an application.

585
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,626
Well, we was thinking
about something

586
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,070
- a little more proactive.
- Proactive?

587
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,131
What, you been
coaching him?

588
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:41,373
McManus, I know what you suspect me
of doing inside these walls,

589
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,380
and if you believe
your suspicions,

590
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,383
you gotta admit,
I run a business better than most.

591
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,620
- So you'd both serve as foremen?
- Exactly.

592
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,953
You know, see,
I really don't have the money

593
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,787
in my budget
for two positions.

594
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,318
Ms. Degenhart, that brings me
to a question that I have...

595
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,196
Your employees,
they make minimum wage?

596
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,667
No. No, not even close.

597
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,897
So they make
a pittance.

598
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,634
Well, I mean no disrespect,
Minister Said,

599
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:13,474
when I say it's honest people
who deserve an honest wage.

600
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,036
Besides, Said, this is more
than the $2.50 a week

601
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,674
you're currently making
in receiving a discharge.

602
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,775
That's like telling
a slave it's not all bad

603
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,844
'cause he gets to work with his family,
inside the master's house.

604
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,187
Come on, the woman just trying
to get the operation off the ground.

605
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,125
At whose expense?

606
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,287
Look, I have no intention
of exploiting anyone.

607
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,492
Sometimes that
just comes naturally.

608
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,194
Sadly, the thing about
business at its core,

609
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,965
it is always
just business.

610
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,264
I've decided.

611
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,368
The Muslims...
will not participate.

612
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,275
Excuse me.

613
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,488
Well, ain't but
one thing I got to say:

614
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:05,292
Fuck him. I'll work for nothing
until you hit your profit's bull's-eye.

615
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,558
- Well, my foreman.
- Yes.

616
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,034
"And life to me
is-is-is about living,

617
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,735
feelings and all
and trying not to fall

618
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,471
into them hard places
inside you

619
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,639
created by them
hard places around you.

620
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,512
It's a l-don't-
give-a-fuck song,

621
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,212
set to the tune of the bullshit
that bore you,

622
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:33,189
the place between dreams is-
is a situation signifying nothing.

623
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,089
So to me,

624
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,721
I'm just fixing my mind
to just enjoy the dream,

625
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:43,063
'cause everything else
when I ain't asleep is gray,

626
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,002
and life is about wherever
you gonna get to, getting got to."

627
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,098
Man, Augustus,
this poem is for you.

628
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,836
The meeting
didn't go well.

629
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,872
How can you tell?

630
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,407
- Your eyes are filled with rage.
- Hmph.

631
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:05,115
Arif, my heart is filled
with disappointment.

632
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:09,058
How come all good things have
to have a bad thing attached to them?

633
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,926
"If faith were easy,
everyone would believe."

634
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:16,263
- Those are your own words.
- Yeah, hmph.

635
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,427
There's gotta be
a way, Arif,

636
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,029
to do business
without cheating all the workers.

637
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,668
- Economics is not my strong suit.
- Yeah.

638
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,338
Where you going?

639
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,939
To think.

640
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,847
Just to think.

641
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,160
Man, I wish to Christ I could
figure out what Redding is up to.

642
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,254
Rumor is he's walking away
from the kitchen,

643
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,131
that he's gonna be foreman
of that telemarketing business.

644
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,431
That don't mean
he'll stop slinging.

645
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,437
And what we need
is some information.

646
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,565
Alvarez, join us.

647
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,633
You want me
to sit with you?

648
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,736
Yeah, I figure you
and Guerra made peace.

649
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,339
You won't be stabbing each other
with the silverware.

650
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,713
Besides,
I got a question.

651
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,843
Nine inches, baby.

652
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,356
- You friendly with any of the niggers?
- No.

653
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,986
- Poet a little bit, maybe.
- Yeah.

654
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,155
He knows you and us
have been at war.

655
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,222
I want you
to talk to him.

656
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,632
Find out what Redding's
real plans are.

657
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,293
Spy.

658
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,602
Well, yeah.

659
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,267
I ain't hungry
anymore.

660
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,835
Do this, Miguel.

661
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,439
We'll welcome you
back into El Norte.

662
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,473
You know, I'm...

663
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,748
I'm glad me and Chico aren't
at each other's throats anymore,

664
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,948
but that's as far
as it goes, man.

665
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,447
I got my parole
in three years.

666
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,894
Until that point,
I'm Mahatma Fucking Gandhi.

667
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,894
You want
the peach cobbler?

668
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,574
Miguelito...
you look great.

669
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,547
Yeah, and you look
really young.

670
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:48,575
What's up with the visit
after all this time?

671
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,144
Do I need more of a reason
than you're my son?

672
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,213
Didn't matter much
before, did it?

673
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,658
Maybe I haven't been here 'cause
you're always in solitary or the hole

674
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,924
or escaping and not even
coming to see me.

675
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,760
When would I have
a chance to visit, huh?

676
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,928
You just came here to make my life
more fucked up, right?

677
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,334
Thank you.

678
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,363
Be Mr. Macho Muchacho
all you want,

679
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,638
but if you're so tough,

680
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,509
think what that says about
the bitch that bore you.

681
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,244
You're a tough bitch.

682
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,777
Yeah.

683
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,383
You do bore me.

684
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,688
Okay, I'm glad
you came.

685
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:43,440
You know, when I escaped,
I didn't come to see you

686
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,137
because I thought that'd be
the first place the cops would look.

687
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,736
It was.

688
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,813
How's Maritza doing?

689
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,341
She's wonderful.

690
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,718
She fuckin' anybody?

691
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,416
She's working
as a travel agent

692
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,652
sending people to Europe,
Japan, Australia...

693
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,991
Ma, I asked you
a question.

694
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:09,523
I speak to her once,
maybe twice a month.

695
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,558
I don't think she is.

696
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,594
You tell her that
she gotta come visit me.

697
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,241
That would mean a lot more
coming from you.

698
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,937
I ain't gonna ask.
I ain't gonna beg.

699
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,969
She should
just show up.

700
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,942
Shit.

701
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,542
Hey, it's Maritza.

702
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,076
I'm not home,
so please leave a message.

703
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:10,155
Hey... Ritz.

704
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,595
Thinking about you
a lot lately.

705
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,067
Ma told me how good
you were doing, you know,

706
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,070
sending people all over
the world and stuff.

707
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:25,203
You know, I hope
you don't forget

708
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,972
that I'm still
part of yours,

709
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,675
because, baby,
you're still most of mine.

710
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,416
I know that I haven't
been the best...

711
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,119
you know...

712
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,926
of anything the last
couple of years,

713
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,798
but if, um...

714
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,326
you could use some
of that travel agent,

715
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,431
you know, magic
to arrange for a car

716
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,704
go to Oz,

717
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,870
damn...

718
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,348
I'd make
that trip worthwhile...

719
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,576
I promise.

720
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,312
All right.

721
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,655
I love you.

722
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,221
And I miss you,
Maritza.

723
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,162
Yeah, I really do.

724
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,033
Please come.

725
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,841
Yeah, please come.

726
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,743
Let's say a young man
mugs someone,

727
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,585
a young girl steals
20 purses from Sears,

728
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,923
a young mother
drowns her daughter.

729
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,126
The one thing they're all said
to lack is common sense.

730
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,497
Somewhere along the way

731
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,197
they lost their ability
to think correctly.

732
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,002
Well, look at Oz.

733
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,874
Common sense creates
the common criminal.

734
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,936
The desire to do right

735
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,178
is probably the most
uncommon sense of all.

736
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,251
Father. Father,
what's the matter?

737
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,654
- Help! Help!
- Bring in that crash cart!

738
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,659
- Father Meehan's dead.
- Oh, fuck.

739
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,890
Hey, O'Reily,

740
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,832
I heard your pal Father Meehan
crashed and burned.

741
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,859
That must be tearing
you up inside, huh?

742
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,497
- Yeah, he was a good man.
- Yeah.

743
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,337
Well, I guess now you got
a little taste of what it felt like

744
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,242
- when you murdered my father.
- We're done talking, bitch.

745
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,714
Oh, I was just wondering how you're gonna
feel when Cyril dies.

746
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,011
We're appealing
Cyril's case.

747
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,078
And your ma.

748
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,250
What?

749
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,952
Your ma.

750
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,929
You go anywhere
near my mother,

751
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,363
I'll fuckin'
skin you alive.

752
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,266
I don't have to touch her.
I got the evil eye, remember?

753
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,202
Yeah, whatever.

754
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,330
Okay, that's what
killed Meehan, you know?

755
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,603
My wife's grandmother put
the evil eye on the fat fuck,

756
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:12,734
he was dead within hours.

757
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,768
You know, Schibetta, you really
do belong in psych, man.

758
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,212
You're fuckin' nuts.

759
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,715
Meehan gave me
his rosary.

760
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,481
That's all you need... a possession
of the person you want cursed.

761
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,044
I gave the rosary
to my wife

762
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,490
to give to her nana...
arrivederci, Meehan.

763
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:31,790
I'm gonna put the curse
on every single person you love,

764
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,491
and when you can't stand
the grief one more second

765
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,726
I'm gonna
put it on you,

766
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,396
and I'll be smiling when you're
twisting in your own shit.

767
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:43,463
Hey, you fucking dago,
you motherfucker!

768
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,408
- Fuckin'...
- Easy, O'Reily.

769
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,435
It's okay, man,
that's just a momentary lapse.

770
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,777
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

771
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,874
Okay, come on,
let's take 'em down.

772
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,752
Hey, Chucky.
You got a minute?

773
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:07,230
For you, O'Reily,
I got only 28 seconds,

774
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:11,223
but the way you double-talk,
it should be plenty.

775
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,758
Peter Schibetta.

776
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,930
Now he's walking around saying
he can put curses on people?

777
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,963
The evil eye, sure.

778
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,441
He says his wife's
grandmother's got the power.

779
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,637
Petey's got
two screws loose.

780
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,703
Oh, man, I feel a lot
better hearing that,

781
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:27,683
'cause not only did he say
that he put a curse on me,

782
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,051
he said he put
a curse on you.

783
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,079
Yeah, that's
what he said.

784
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,354
I think he still blames you for him taking it
up the ass... twice.

785
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,793
The fuckin'
little prick.

786
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,265
Maybe you should
go talk to Peter, huh?

787
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,767
- Yeah, maybe I should.
- Yeah.

788
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,879
When you say, "Screw your
courage to the sticking place,"

789
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,580
what you're saying is,
"Have some balls.

790
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,589
- Keep on track."
- Oh.

791
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,922
"But screw your courage
to the sticking place

792
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,121
- and we'll not fail."
- Good.

793
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,187
- Then I explain the murder plan.
- Right.

794
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,358
All right, that's it.

795
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,231
We start up again
tomorrow at 3:00.

796
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,327
All right, thank you very much.
We'll see you later.

797
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,397
Suzanne, I've got to tell you,
I'm having the best time.

798
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,375
I've got to go meet
my wife right now,

799
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,344
but I can't wait
to tell her all about you.

800
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,505
Thanks,
we'll see you later.

801
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,350
Hey, have you heard
from the lawyer

802
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,355
about the exact date
of Cyril's appeal?

803
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:43,052
Well, all Zelman said
was sometime this week.

804
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,964
- Damn.
- What's the matter?

805
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,727
I can't find
my car keys.

806
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,758
- What?
- I was sure I left them right here.

807
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,067
Oh, Christ, Mom.
I'll bet Schibetta stole them.

808
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,039
He's gonna put a curse on you.
I gotta go.

809
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,735
- Oh, Ryan.
- No, I gotta go.

810
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,141
- Slow down, O'Reily.
- I got an emergency.

811
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,203
- What emergency?
- I can't explain. Let me go.

812
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,477
- You ain't going anywhere.
- Fuck.

813
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,881
Yo yo yo,
Petey, baba.

814
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,415
Chucky, boys,
long time no see.

815
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,361
- Petey, where you going?
- Visit with my wife.

816
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,854
- We called and canceled it.
- Why?

817
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,199
- You and me have a little chat.
- About?

818
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,500
Life and death.

819
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,439
My life,
your death.

820
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,534
Chucky, no!

821
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,349
Warden, you better come
and see this.

822
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,797
Well, I can't say
I'm sorry Schibetta's dead.

823
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,758
What's that?

824
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,070
His eye.

825
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,611
Lockdown! Lockdown!

826
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,580
What the fuck
is going on, man?

827
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,482
O'Reily, catch.

828
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,059
There's that
little prick.

829
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:32,592
Robson, you shanked me
and I almost died.

830
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,231
- You're going to wish I had.
- Officer! Officer! Officer!

831
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,241
You fucking cunt!

832
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,009
Outta here,
let's go.

833
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,742
Holy shit.

834
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,351
Yeah.

835
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,398
- Vern, I need your help.
- Keep walking.

836
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,703
After all I've done for the Brotherhood,
you owe me.

837
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,143
Hey, you heard the man,
keep walking.

838
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,146
Watch your mouth, prag.

839
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,916
I'm not a prag anymore, pal,
and as for watching my mouth,

840
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,388
you're the one with
the nigger gums. Bye-bye.

841
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,101
You know what
true boredom is?

842
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,267
True boredom is when
you want to get yourself off

843
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,606
and you don't want to
at exactly the same time.

844
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,307
Listen, Cutler, the wops
have got it out for me.

845
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,441
I need
your protection.

846
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:57,317
In return, I'll steal,
I'll shank...

847
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:00,949
you name it. I need your clout
to keep my ass safe.

848
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,686
Well, if that's
what you want,

849
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,455
I'm afraid your ass
is the one thing

850
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,258
that's not gonna
be safe... prag.

851
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:11,461
- I'm no bitch.
- Then ciao, baby.

852
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,199
If you want to stay alive,

853
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,179
come get Poppa
out of his boredom.

854
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,761
I don't really have anyone else
to talk to in this place.

855
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,527
That's what
I'm here for.

856
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,433
You ever been
scared of dying?

857
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,532
Oh, yeah.

858
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,134
My first year here,

859
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,703
a man named
Warren Sticks,

860
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,977
we were in the middle
of a session

861
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:03,281
and suddenly he leapt
out of his chair

862
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,050
and started
to choke me.

863
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,820
I blacked out,
and when I came to

864
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,090
I was lying in
a pool of blood,

865
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,689
his blood.

866
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,393
He had slit his wrists

867
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,096
with the edge
of my tape dispenser.

868
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,265
I realized he was...

869
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,637
attempting to
knock me out

870
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,437
so he could kill himself.

871
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,104
You remember
that sensation,

872
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,080
thinking you were
gonna die?

873
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,576
Is that how
you feel now?

874
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,679
I've felt that way
every day

875
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,349
since as long
as I can remember.

876
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,722
How far back is that?

877
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,784
Much further
than I'd like.

878
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,565
I was Gerald Robson's
only child.

879
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,933
Even as a kid,

880
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,632
you do what you gotta do
to survive,

881
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:03,241
'cause when you're six,
running away is not an option.

882
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,649
- Did he beat you?
- Oh, yeah.

883
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,485
And worse.

884
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:18,160
Did he abuse you
sexually?

885
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,561
It's funny,
here I am 36 years old,

886
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,662
and I got nowhere to run.

887
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,635
You know?
And I-I guess what...

888
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,508
what I want to know is:

889
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:41,247
Is it okay to do
whatever is necessary...

890
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,650
to survive?

891
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:47,646
- Is what okay?
- Or should I die?

892
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,663
- No no, but...
- That's what I figured.

893
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,928
Thanks, Sister.

894
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,864
Sometimes
the worst thing,

895
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,864
- the worst possible fucking...
...fuckin' state of being

896
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,309
is having all your senses
workin' full tilt.

897
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,313
How can that be bad?

898
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,178
Well, there are
certain things we do...

899
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,651
when seen, touched, heard, smelled
and tasted all at the same time...

900
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,586
that'll make you wish
you were dead.

901
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,759
Lick this.

902
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,564
That's right,
lick it real good.

903
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,501
Now give it
back to me.

904
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,606
Drop your pants.

905
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,212
Now bend over.

906
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,522
What?

907
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,460
You and me,
we're gonna spoon.

908
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,589
Now bend
the fuck over.
