1
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:41,175
Mercy is the compassion we feel
for someone else's misfortune.

2
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:44,581
Mercy compels us to alleviate
that misfortune.

3
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,587
Mercy is a child of charity,
but the sister of justice

4
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,021
because both are about
the invisible link

5
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,718
that exists between people.

6
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,129
Mercy is spontaneous because
misery is involuntary.

7
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,360
At approximately 3:15 P.M.,

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,494
as your children were walking home
from school with four classmates,

9
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,937
a blue van pulled up
beside them.

10
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:07,997
A male Caucasian
stepped out.

11
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,238
The man approached Gary and Holly
saying that you, Mrs. Beecher,

12
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,075
had asked him
to pick them up.

13
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:15,707
Gary was reluctant at first,

14
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,614
but eventually,
the man persuaded him...

15
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,051
using Pokemon cards.

16
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,055
The van then drove off
to the East side of town.

17
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,523
So what's being done to find them?

18
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,187
Kidnapping is
a waiting game, Sister.

19
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,196
We have to wait
to be contacted.

20
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,425
- And what if you're not?
- Milk cartons.

21
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,264
- Toby.
- Come on. Schillinger did this.

22
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:38,430
- We have no proof of that.
- Oh, for fuck's sake. Who else?

23
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,440
You come from
a wealthy family.

24
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,908
Most likely we have
a ransom situation.

25
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:46,470
You are fucking this up,
you asshole.

26
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,311
Find my goddamn kids!

27
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,478
- Oh, my God!
- Find my goddamn kids!

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,954
Get him out! Out!

29
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,283
Find my kids!

30
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,598
l don't know anything
about a kidnapping.

31
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:12,127
Beecher seems
to think you do,

32
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,503
that you're behind this.

33
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,701
He and l have had a lot of shit
happen between us,

34
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,371
so l can understand
him saying that.

35
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:22,779
But Beecher and l have
one thing in common, too.

36
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,681
We're both fathers.

37
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,913
l lost a son.

38
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:30,411
l know what he's going through.

39
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,686
l'm sorry about
what happened in the library.

40
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,128
l just got so frustrated.

41
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:38,994
l know. l know.

42
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,500
You might want to call your mother.
She's pretty upset.

43
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,127
We talked about it in the car.

44
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,229
Toby, the reasons
you're in here, the--

45
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:51,370
the alcoholism and the hitting
the little Brockwell girl,

46
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:57,281
your mother and l can't help
but think that we're...

47
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,750
to blame for so much of it.

48
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,310
- Dad, no.
- We failed you growing up.

49
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,948
Look, as much
as l'd like to blame you

50
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,720
for the miserable shithole
my life has become,

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,218
what's wrong with me
is inside me.

52
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,231
l own it,

53
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:15,598
and either l have to control it
or it will control me.

54
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,063
Right now, l just want
to hold my babies.

55
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,436
So our sweet young things
are safe and sound?

56
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,710
- Yeah.
- All right.

57
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,414
Time to kick this thing
into overdrive.

58
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,983
l want you
to send the package.

59
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,118
Dad, you sure?

60
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,154
- Yes.
- 'Cause l been thinking.

61
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:48,133
Like you know l've never had
a problem with breaking the law.

62
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:51,535
l'm talking about at most
a couple stolen Çamrys.

63
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,971
This kidnapping...

64
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,202
Keep your voice down.

65
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:59,302
This kind of thing
is really not my style.

66
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,337
l'll pay you double.

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,274
Okay.

68
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,617
- Are you Les Hibitz?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,321
Tobias Beecher.
Mind if l join you?

70
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,890
- You want to sit with me?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,901
Nobody ever wants
to sit with me.

72
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:28,732
l understand you did some
fed time for kidnapping, right?

73
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:32,336
- Yeah, l was framed.
- Yeah, l'm sure you were.

74
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,847
But l don't know
if you've heard,

75
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,145
but my two children were
abducted recently.

76
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:39,208
- l had nothing to do with it.
- l know.

77
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,049
What l'm asking is--

78
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,250
l was wondering if you might
be able to look into it.

79
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,417
Find out if somebody
was hired to do the job.

80
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,019
l could ask around,
see what l could find out,

81
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,554
but l wouldn't
hold out much hope.

82
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,536
So, do you like Def Leppard?

83
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:01,104
Years and years
and years ago,

84
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:04,542
the Catholic Church made a list
of all the ways we can show mercy.

85
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,772
Feed the hungry,
give drink to the thirsty,

86
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,906
clothe the naked,
shit like that.

87
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,644
Another of them was
ransom the captive.

88
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:14,051
ln those days,
pirates and infidels and such

89
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,887
would abduct fair maidens
and Christian pilgrims.

90
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:21,325
God-fearing people were expected
to pay for their return.

91
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:25,058
Who gets to ransom the captive
in this day and age?

92
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,091
lnstead, we're expected
to visit the imprisoned.

93
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:32,662
That's right.
Come on down.

94
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,146
Break it up, you two.

95
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:57,021
- Are you ok?
- Oh shit yeah.

96
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,998
Hey, man, they stab me,
they shoot me,

97
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,933
l ain't going down.

98
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,797
How you doing?

99
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:11,540
- My kids.
- l heard.

100
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,478
That's fucked up.
l'm sorry.

101
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,049
l feel so goddamn helpless.

102
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,575
l bet.

103
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,886
At least the baby,
Harry, is safe.

104
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,256
Toby, they're gonna
be all right, you hear me?

105
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,194
They're gonna be ok.
They're gonna be fine.

106
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,707
Oh, man.

107
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:44,073
l missed you.

108
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,203
Me, too.

109
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:07,489
Keller's back
in Emerald City.

110
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,264
Two love birds
have reunited.

111
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,533
And l hope they enjoy
their evening together.

112
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:15,803
lt's gonna be
the last night of sleep...

113
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,969
or peace...

114
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:21,276
that Beecher's gonna have
for a long, long time.

115
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:46,429
Chris?

116
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,463
Sorry, did l wake you?

117
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,444
Hey.

118
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:58,575
What's the matter?

119
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,109
Toby, l died...

120
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,152
and there's no white light.

121
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,784
l was there,
but they brought me back.

122
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,456
But l was there, Toby.
l was in hell and l felt everything.

123
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,988
l felt the pain and l felt
the fire for all eternity.

124
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,263
Hey. Hey.
lt's gonna be ok.

125
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,668
No, it's not gonna be ok.
Don't fucking lie to me.

126
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,832
l was there, Toby.
They're bringing me back.

127
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,708
You know what's funny?

128
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,679
You got pissed at me
for talking to Said about God,

129
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:30,945
but that's what l was
talking to him about.

130
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:36,820
'Cause if all that's left
for us in this life is Oz,

131
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:41,293
we better start thinking
about what's next,

132
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,194
what comes after.

133
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,561
Don't let go.

134
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,600
Okay, okay.

135
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,712
Tobias.

136
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,987
l didn't expect to see you here today,
given what's going on.

137
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:17,429
Well, work helps keep my mind
from caving in on itself.

138
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:21,399
Oh, l hear that.
lt's a madhouse outside,

139
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,595
though the crowd
of protesters is smaller.

140
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,332
l'm afraid people are getting
used to capital punishment.

141
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,966
Sister Pete,
l need to ask you a favor.

142
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,808
lf l can, you know l will. What?

143
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,938
Talk to Chris.

144
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:40,351
Now how is it that you ask me
the one thing that l won't do?

145
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,910
He feels terrible.

146
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:46,051
Tobias, he tried
to use me to get to you.

147
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,957
Now he's using you
to get to me.

148
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:50,895
l will not play his game.

149
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,091
He's afraid that
if you leave the convent,

150
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,565
he's gonna burn forever.

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,068
He's gonna burn all right,
but not for that.

152
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,833
He's gonna burn for all
of the other people he's hurt,

153
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:03,239
all of the other lives
he's destroyed, including yours.

154
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,217
We've been going
through the records

155
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,015
of various prisoners
at Emerald City.

156
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:18,421
One pops out as a potential
connection to the kidnapping.

157
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,722
- Who?
- Christopher Keller.

158
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,627
No. Chris is my friend.

159
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,325
Let me see that.

160
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,698
Keller broke every bone
in your body.

161
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,761
- He's the one?
- He saved my life from Schillinger.

162
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,602
l'm telling you,
Schillinger is responsible.

163
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,165
Armed robbery,
assault, kidnapping.

164
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,179
- He wasn't convicted.
- Police suspect him of raping,

165
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:43,114
torturing and murdering
several homosexual men?

166
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,243
lt can't be him.
lt's not him.

167
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,877
How can you be so sure?

168
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:52,624
l know Chris, Mother...

169
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:55,058
intimately.

170
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,686
lntimately?

171
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,596
He's my lover.

172
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,012
Holy shit.

173
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,488
Vern, you better come see this.

174
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,888
What you got?

175
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,392
A package for Tobias Beecher.
Look.

176
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,895
Jesus Christ.

177
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,487
Officer Howell?

178
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,522
We got a problem here.

179
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,769
What the hell is that?

180
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,137
A child's hand.

181
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:28,316
Leave us alone.

182
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,686
How you holding up?

183
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:38,423
A few days in the hole

184
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:42,298
only increases my credibility
with Pancamo, Adebisi and Morales.

185
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,826
Ever spend any time in here?

186
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,771
No.

187
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,535
Good.

188
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,839
You look like shit.

189
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,250
- So l'm in?
- ''So l'm in.''

190
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,413
Adebisi ain't convinced, man.

191
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,980
Looks like you're gonna
have to take another test.

192
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,958
Oh, yeah.

193
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,224
We going to box?

194
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:12,788
We want to see
if you can take a punch...

195
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,231
or two.

196
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:16,428
You got a problem
with me, man?

197
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,268
Yeah, you're weak.

198
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,672
Give me gloves.

199
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,575
Well, actually
we're not gonna spar.

200
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,909
- No?
- No.

201
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,212
l'm gonna use you
for a heavy bag.

202
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,777
And the rest of us bet
on how long you stay standing.

203
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,851
Ready?

204
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:42,453
- Yeah.
- Ding, ding.

205
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,203
That was it.
Fifteen seconds.

206
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,545
l win. Pay up.

207
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,723
Ow!

208
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,752
Yo, real impressive.

209
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,560
Yeah, thanks.

210
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:24,797
- Your bruises must hurt.
- Uh-huh.

211
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:29,638
Brought you a little something
to soothe your wounds.

212
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,912
Later.

213
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,066
Yo.

214
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,710
What the fuck is you doing?

215
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,443
The breakfast of champions.

216
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,968
You wanted to see me?

217
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,702
We just took
a straw poll on you.

218
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,972
l voted yes.

219
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,206
- l voted no.
- l abstained.

220
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:44,148
- A tie.
- How do l break this tie?

221
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,678
There's a final test.

222
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,483
Which is?

223
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,684
You gotta kill somebody.

224
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,422
- Who?
- Anybody.

225
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,123
We don't care.

226
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,861
All right. l'll do it.

227
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:34,624
Pete, l have terrible news.

228
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,159
- Oh, my God. What?
- The Cardinal is coming.

229
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,605
Cardinal Abgott
is coming to Oz?

230
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,801
He wants to say a mass,
meet with the staff

231
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,470
and then with some prisoners.

232
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:48,571
You're friends
with him, right?

233
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,845
l worked with him in his office
until he transferred me here.

234
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:56,184
l... disagreed
with him once too often.

235
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:00,225
l'm taking the day off.

236
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,386
Oh, no. You can't.

237
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:05,261
Ray, l have one foot
out of the convent door.

238
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,265
l think hobnobbing
with the Cardinal

239
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,392
would be just a little
hypocritical, don't you?

240
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,302
Yeah, well, he specifically
asked to meet you.

241
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,272
Me? Why?

242
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:17,798
Apparently this whole thing
started because his eminence

243
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:20,038
received a letter
from a prisoner.

244
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,907
Which one?

245
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,212
Chris Keller.

246
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:28,152
Chris Keller.
Of course.

247
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,187
Raymond.

248
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,923
Cardinal Abgott,
it's good of you to come.

249
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:41,057
lt's a pleasure
to see you, son.

250
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,591
Let's suit up.

251
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:53,111
Do you know why
l transferred you to Oswald?

252
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,409
l had too many opinions?

253
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,245
You had too big an ego.

254
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,612
Probably.

255
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:06,056
Something tells me
that's changed.

256
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:11,619
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

257
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:16,868
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

258
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,972
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

259
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,806
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

260
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:35,248
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

261
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,312
l spoke to the head
of your order

262
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,256
Sister Liocarria.

263
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,727
She says you're questioning
your own vocation.

264
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,159
Yes, l am.

265
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,826
Welcome to the club.

266
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,733
You?

267
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,261
My first parish was way out
in the country,

268
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,206
a desolate area.

269
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,939
The pastor was old,
the housekeeper even older.

270
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:04,075
When winter hit,
it was lonely.

271
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:06,311
l cried...

272
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,320
and l prayed.

273
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,584
l cried some more...

274
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,616
and prayed even harder.

275
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,096
Well, that's what l'm doing.

276
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,722
Good.

277
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:23,565
Then whatever you decide
will be the right thing to do.

278
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,836
Thank you.

279
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:33,935
God bless you, Sister.

280
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,753
God bless you, Sister.

281
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:47,848
As you already know,
the jury has ruled in our favor.

282
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:51,795
They recognize that
the State was guilty

283
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,630
in all injuries and deaths
caused after the riot.

284
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,136
So they have made
recommendations

285
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,502
that we receive
the full settlement.

286
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,441
45 million.

287
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,104
Oh, yeah!

288
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,206
Before you all go spending
that money, know this,

289
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,046
the State has appealed
the decision.

290
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,848
- Appealed?
- Yes, appealed. lt is an election year.

291
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,287
There is no way that Devlin
will write us a check,

292
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,257
not before November.

293
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,521
Said, you can't goose
this thing along?

294
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,256
As we are all aware,
the legal system moves very slow.

295
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,161
There's no way
we can know when our case

296
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:28,291
is gonna be coming before
the appellate court.

297
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:31,633
Took almost 30 years for
the prisoners of Attica to win.

298
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,002
30 fucking years?
Christ.

299
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,372
l'll be ancient.
Like you, Rebadow.

300
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,378
Look, l know
this is frustrating,

301
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,609
but l want you all to see
the court decision this week,

302
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:47,779
it was a huge hurdle,
a huge victory.

303
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,880
We must remain resolved.

304
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:53,255
l'll inform you
of anything else.

305
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,755
Yes?

306
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,961
Have you ever
killed anyone?

307
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,594
No.

308
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:10,575
An extraordinary experience
watching the life fade

309
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,236
from someone's eyes.

310
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:23,244
Even as he was dying,
Hernandez's instinct

311
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,483
was to kill me
for killing him.

312
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,464
Survival meant less to him
than revenge.

313
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:40,037
And this preamble
is taking us where?

314
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,802
Jason Kramer. You've successfully
gotten him a new trial.

315
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:44,604
Yes.

316
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:47,771
l know you've been under a lot
of pressure from the other Muslims

317
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,281
not to get involved
with the case.

318
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:53,978
- Yes?
- l think you should listen to them.

319
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,044
And you think this
because...

320
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:59,387
Last night l had a premonition.
Kramer will go free.

321
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:03,523
Rebadow, l'm gonna
tell you something.

322
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,189
l'm gonna explain to you.

323
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,098
Jason Kramer is guilty
of murdering his lover.

324
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:12,865
l have seen the trial transcripts
and all the evidence.

325
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:15,533
He will be convicted again.

326
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:17,974
Then why did you fight
to get him a new trial?

327
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,877
The jury voted against Kramer
because he was gay.

328
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:23,746
So this whole thing
is theoretical for you.

329
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:26,273
There is nothing theoretical
about justice.

330
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,343
And if Kramer goes free...

331
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:32,882
That's not gonna happen.

332
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,120
You'd better pray
you're right.

333
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,269
We have a request for a meeting
regarding your case.

334
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:46,203
Yeah?
A meeting with who?

335
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:49,207
The homicide detective
who arrested you.

336
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,766
Robert Stransky.

337
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,505
Here's the deal.

338
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:57,208
You got this cocksucker
a new trial, right?

339
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:03,484
My doctor tells me l got three
or four more months to live.

340
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:06,116
Now before l die,

341
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:09,059
l want to make certain
things straight.

342
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,096
l want you to know

343
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,464
l tampered
with the evidence.

344
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:21,063
l couldn't find the murder weapon,
so l went to the kitchen.

345
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:24,769
l opened a drawer
and took out a kitchen knife,

346
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,505
l smeared it
in the blood

347
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,570
and l dropped it
next to his body.

348
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:31,606
His fingerprints are
all over that knife.

349
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,778
No.

350
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:37,817
No, they weren't.

351
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:42,315
My pal in forensics
doctored up the tests.

352
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:48,824
And you would be willing
to give a deposition?

353
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,528
To go into court
and say this?

354
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,164
l know this fucker's
guilty as shit,

355
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:58,336
but l want to buy back
a piece of my soul.

356
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:01,471
Yeah, if you want me to,

357
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:03,947
l'll yell it
from the prison roof.

358
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:06,382
Ok, sweetheart?

359
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:12,286
We go public
with this information,

360
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,519
the press will get
a seven inch boner.

361
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,959
Yes.

362
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:19,293
And you say the only witness,
the guy at airborn, is dead?

363
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,060
Yes.

364
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,668
l don't know, man.

365
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,569
l'm feeling like
maybe this could swing in my favor.

366
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:31,242
Yes. Kramer...

367
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:35,042
l'm recusing myself
from the case.

368
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,570
What's that mean?

369
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:41,575
lt means l am resigning
as your lawyer...

370
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,315
immediately.

371
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:52,124
To instruct the ignorant,
counsel the doubtful,

372
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:53,791
to admonish the sinners.

373
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:56,164
ln order for these
works of mercy to happen,

374
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:58,101
you need two things:

375
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,626
someone in distress

376
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,037
and someone with the capacity
to help them.

377
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,666
ln other words,

378
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,974
an ignoramus can't instruct
another ignoramus,

379
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:11,540
and a sinner
can't admonish a sinner.

380
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,778
Today in the retrial
of Jason Kramer,

381
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,754
who had previously been
convicted for the murder of his lover,

382
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,951
the jury reached a verdict,
finding Kramer not guilty.

383
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,688
The Adamsville native, who has
served nearly two years,

384
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:25,697
is expected to be released
from the Oswald Correctional Facility

385
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,426
sometime this week.

386
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,559
ln other news,
the state's jobless rate fell

387
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:32,729
slightly over
the past month 3.8°/%.

388
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,762
Preliminary figures
released yesterday

389
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,398
by the state's
labor department

390
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,968
show that employers created
nearly 1,000 new jobs.

391
00:26:57,162 --> 00:27:00,757
Allah is not
listening, brother.

392
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,790
He is deaf to you.

393
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,494
Warden, a word?

394
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,566
l know that you've been
having meetings recently

395
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,441
with members
of the local community

396
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,606
regarding possible replacements
for Tim McManus.

397
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:52,116
- Yes.
- l also know that you talked

398
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,345
about hiring an African-American
for the job.

399
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:57,184
- What, you got my office bugged?
- l want to come

400
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,190
and see you, warden.
Discuss with you

401
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:01,351
the kind of man
who you should consider.

402
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,988
Well, l'd love that, Said,
but l've already hired someone.

403
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,895
ln fact,
he's on his way in now.

404
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:09,196
His name is Martin Querns.

405
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,327
l want to thank you
for this opportunity.

406
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,668
l've heard about Emerald City
for years now.

407
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:15,832
Well, the place started out
as an experiment,

408
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,069
but unfortunately
it pretty much failed.

409
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,511
Well, l don't know.
Maybe the first stage failed,

410
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,343
but like any
worthwhile experiment,

411
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,977
we need to try different methods
till we figure out what works.

412
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:31,888
Well, for me the most
important elements are,

413
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:34,323
one, keeping a lid
on the racial tension;

414
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,522
and two, keeping a lid
on the violence in general.

415
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:39,325
Those are my priorities
as well.

416
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,197
Do l have your permission
to do what l feel is necessary

417
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,202
to keep the peace?

418
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:47,603
Yes. l'll let you have
a fairly free hand...

419
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:50,335
until you fuck up.

420
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,469
Well, l can't ask
for any more than that.

421
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:26,339
Okay, everybody, listen up.

422
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,369
l want to introduce you
to Martin Querns,

423
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,678
the new unit manager.
He has a vast range of experience,

424
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:34,651
having worked in both
federal prisons

425
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:37,382
as well as
state detention centers.

426
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:42,993
The warden is correct.

427
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:45,462
l have served in many
correctional facilities,

428
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:49,263
but what he didn't say
was that, like most of you,

429
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,565
l come from the streets.

430
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,468
l'm not some candy-ass,
white liberal

431
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,939
looking to turn you
into better citizens.

432
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,636
l intend to meet with
each of you individually,

433
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:02,340
but until that time,
keep one principle in mind:

434
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,043
don't fuck with Querns.

435
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,043
That's all.

436
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:15,155
l wanted to meet with you first
because as l understand,

437
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:17,684
you're one of the leaders
around here

438
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,323
in terms of the drug trade.

439
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,925
As a teen-ager l worked
for Slim Sam Colby.

440
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,526
You know him?

441
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:30,007
Slim Sam weighed
about 300 lbs, of course.

442
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,441
l worked my way up through
his organization

443
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:37,505
until Ricky J. Lee
blew Slim sam's head off.

444
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,245
l decided the moment
had come to retire.

445
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,583
And the point
of all this?

446
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:45,556
To let you know
l know every trick you got.

447
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,026
To let you know
l'm smarter than you.

448
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,053
- You smarter than me?
- Oh, yeah.

449
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:56,864
'Cause unlike you,
l never got caught.

450
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:58,836
How do you keep that thing
on your head?

451
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,102
Now what are you
gonna do? Hit me?

452
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:06,006
Sit down.

453
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:11,446
l want you to listen to me good,
Simon Adebisi.

454
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:14,111
To my mind,
drugged-out prisoners

455
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,949
make for a quiet cell block,

456
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,956
so you can sell whatever
the fuck you want

457
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,652
to whoever you want
to sell it to. l don't care.

458
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,354
l'm gonna be looking
the other way.

459
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:25,522
On one condition, man.

460
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,556
Jeez, you are smart.

461
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,266
One condition: no violence.
l mean none, zero.

462
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,069
Agreed?

463
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,041
- That's it, no violence?
- Yup.

464
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,446
He just want me to make sure
that everybody

465
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:46,643
obeys all the rules
all the time.

466
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,615
This could be a trick.

467
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:52,680
- Yeah.
- l don't think so.

468
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:55,420
Like the way things were
back in the old days.

469
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,123
We Sicilians controlled our own streets
so the cops backed away.

470
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,257
Little ltaly was
the safest place in the city.

471
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:03,927
- Look, l vote yes.
- Me, too.

472
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,467
All right.

473
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:13,101
l'm glad you called.
l've actually been meaning to call you.

474
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:14,839
Well, Leo...

475
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,815
after the shooting
and after Diane left,

476
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,943
l admit that l went south.

477
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:23,716
l mean, singing at Officer
Howard's memorial service,

478
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:25,382
that was just crazy.

479
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:30,588
But l've had time to rest
and relax and think.

480
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,291
- Tim--
- l'm ready to come back.

481
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,300
- Come back?
- To run Emerald City.

482
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:39,167
You can't.
The job's not available.

483
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:42,002
- What?
- l've hired someone to replace you.

484
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,271
- Well, unhire him.
- No.

485
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,801
Leo, l took the heat
for that gun coming into Em City,

486
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:50,679
but l read in the papers
it was actually Clayton Hughes,

487
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,615
your little protege,
that brought it in.

488
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,141
Yes, and he's been charged.

489
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,585
He's out on bail
until his trial starts in a few weeks.

490
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:59,852
- l want my unit back.
- How many times you want to hear no?

491
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,860
Leo, this is my life.

492
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:07,523
l'm well aware of that.

493
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:15,864
l do have another offer.

494
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:19,365
Holt's retiring.
l need someone to run Unit B.

495
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,276
l'll take it.

496
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:35,615
Well, well. Look who's here
to join the party.

497
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:50,537
The arrest of Busmalis
and the Cardinal's visit

498
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:52,566
can clearly help
the situation.

499
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,511
Our most recent poll shows
that 42°/% of the public

500
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,913
now believe
the prison system is well run.

501
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,850
That's up 16 points since
after the Em City shooting.

502
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:04,514
We're not getting any backlash because
of Bellinger's execution?

503
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:05,818
A little.

504
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:09,657
But capturing Miguel Alvarez
would balance it out.

505
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:11,855
Unfortunately,
there's still no sign of him.

506
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,592
Our biggest concern
right now is Clayton Hughes.

507
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,497
He's out on bail
and he's been making

508
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:18,399
a lot of speeches
condemning the Governor.

509
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,097
l know.

510
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:22,868
You have a relationship
with Hughes, don't you?

511
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:26,877
Clayton's father and l
were both rookies at Oz.

512
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:31,041
His dad died in my arms,
killed by a prisoner back in 1982.

513
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,141
Well, we could use that.

514
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:36,344
You need to talk
to the man, Leo.

515
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,720
Tell him to shut up.

516
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:43,083
Time for me
to charm the D.A.

517
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:49,225
Desmond...

518
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:53,101
get me Clayton Hughes.

519
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:56,836
What l'm asking is for you
to cool the rhetoric.

520
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,070
Rhetoric?
l speak the truth.

521
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,102
Devlin represents all that
is evil in white society,

522
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:04,081
l can't understand
how you could even think

523
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,106
of running with him
as Lieutenant Governor.

524
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,711
Clayton, you lived a very
protected childhood.

525
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:09,913
Oh, here we go.

526
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:12,115
Not everything is tied
to my father's death.

527
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:13,784
Yes, it is.

528
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,123
You only see the world
as black and white.

529
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:20,621
Trust me, life is gray,
as gray as these fucking walls.

530
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,792
Now, l don't love
James Devlin,

531
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,631
but l don't see him
as Satan either.

532
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:28,935
Somebody must stop him,
and soon.

533
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,347
lntegrity.

534
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:40,477
lt's what sets real leaders apart
from typical politicians.

535
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:42,509
One man running
for governor has...

536
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:45,546
You Americans think just
because you have democracy,

537
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,683
you're better
than everybody else.

538
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:50,489
Elections are not what makes
a country great.

539
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,190
Yeah? And what does?
Vodka?

540
00:35:56,134 --> 00:36:00,195
How do you say it?
To be ruthless.

541
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:02,399
- Who's Ruth?
- Huh?

542
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,533
l don't know
anybody named Ruth.

543
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:09,636
Listen, Nikolai,
l've been thinking.

544
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:12,479
You and me,
we can make a lot of money

545
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:15,247
renting that cell phone
out to the slugs around here.

546
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:17,652
- ''We?''
- Yeah. We're partners now, right?

547
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:20,556
No. The phone
is mine, O'Reily.

548
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:24,392
The more people know about it, the
sooner someone blabs to the hacks.

549
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:27,023
So just keep
your mouth shut tight.

550
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:35,461
God, l wish l could find where
his fucking hiding place is.

551
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:37,031
Fuck.

552
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:40,533
- Like a treasure hunt?
- Yeah.

553
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:43,672
Yeah, like a motherfucking
treasure hunt, Cyril.

554
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:48,118
Listen, l want you to search
every square inch of Em City,

555
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,744
see if you can find
that cell phone.

556
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:53,188
But the trick is,
you can't let anyone know,

557
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,715
especially Stanislofsky,
what you're doing.

558
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,819
- Okay?
- Okay. Can l start now?

559
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,853
Right now. Go ahead.

560
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,376
l did just what you wanted.

561
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:23,114
l didn't say anything
to anybody.

562
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:26,385
Good boy. You didn't
find the cell phone, though, did you?

563
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,153
- Nope.
- And you looked all over?

564
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:33,129
- Yup.
- Where does he keep that fucking thing?

565
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:34,722
Hi, how you doing?

566
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,393
l'm gonna kill
that motherfucker.

567
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,129
l'm gonna fucking kill him.

568
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:41,296
Yes?

569
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:45,571
- Dr. Nathan is here.
- Send her in.

570
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,677
Gloria.

571
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,287
May l hug you?

572
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,815
Yeah.

573
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,191
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

574
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:12,967
Can l get you anything,
do anything?

575
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:17,633
Yeah, you can stop being
so goddamn nice.

576
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:20,868
All right.

577
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:23,642
No, l didn't mean that.

578
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,309
Leo, l know you know
what i'm going through,

579
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:29,582
with your daughter
getting raped.

580
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:34,682
Well, she's better now.
ln time you'll get better, too.

581
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,694
l want to come back to work.

582
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,059
So soon?

583
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,929
lf l don't come back now,
l never will.

584
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:42,762
Gloria...

585
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,360
l don't want you to quit,

586
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,894
but l also don't want you
to rush yourself.

587
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,032
Healing is a process,

588
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,871
a slow process.

589
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,070
Not for me.

590
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:57,047
There's only one thing
l need to do to make myself feel better.

591
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,343
And what's that?

592
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:01,614
Confront Ryan O'Reily.

593
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:06,986
l know you're responsible.

594
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,823
For what?

595
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:12,694
For me getting raped.

596
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,961
- No way!
- Don't deny it. Don't fucking deny it.

597
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,468
- Gloria.
- l know.

598
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:20,027
l know.

599
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,701
You called somebody
and asked them for a favor.

600
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,268
Why would l do that?

601
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:32,146
Because the session the other
day didn't go your way.

602
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:34,048
Because you couldn't
manipulate me.

603
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:35,882
Because you're
a twisted fuck.

604
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:41,882
You want me to say
that l called a pal of mine

605
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:46,124
and l had him beat you
and rape you?

606
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,532
ls that what you want
me to say?

607
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,364
Yes.

608
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:56,639
Fine. l did.

609
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,637
You happy?

610
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:03,646
Yes.

611
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,141
The one thing through
all this shit

612
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:11,315
you've said over and over again
is that you love me

613
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,483
and all you wanted was for me to say
l love you back.

614
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:18,419
Well, l came today
to tell you,

615
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:21,398
to see your face
when l tell you

616
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:24,162
that'll never,
ever happen.

617
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:27,103
ln fact,
it's the opposite.

618
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:28,264
l hate you.

619
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:30,467
l will always hate you

620
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:33,341
until we're both dead
in the ground.

621
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,436
l will hate you!

622
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:38,842
Fine.

623
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:43,119
Then tell me
something else.

624
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:45,520
When he was fucking you,

625
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:46,955
did you think of me?

626
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,758
- Gloria!
- Stop it!

627
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:55,993
Stop!
Back off!

628
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,863
Officer!

629
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:04,238
Did you think of me, huh?
Did you fucking think of me?

630
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:06,903
Did you fucking think of me?
Come on, Gloria!

631
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:09,276
Were you thinking
of me? Huh? Huh?

632
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:13,849
Another work of mercy:

633
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,785
to comfort the afflicted.

634
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,287
But you see,

635
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,619
there are a lot of ways
to comfort somebody,

636
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:22,285
and a lot of afflicted
just don't want to be comforted.

637
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:25,056
Gloria Nathan has decided
to press charges against you,

638
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,427
so you might be looking

639
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:29,524
at another five years
added onto your sentence.

640
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,762
Five years. Gee.

641
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:33,703
And l have to file a report.

642
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:35,399
Fine.

643
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:39,136
l know you pretty well, Ryan.

644
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:41,372
And it may seem crazy,
but l have to tell you

645
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:43,243
that l think you're lying.

646
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:47,274
l don't think you had anything
to do with Gloria's rape.

647
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,776
l said l did it.
l did it.

648
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:51,948
Okay?

649
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,480
Okay.

650
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:58,291
When do we see Dr. Nathan
and those nice people again?

651
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,661
We're not.
lt's over.

652
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:04,395
Oh.
They still hate me?

653
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,767
No, Cyril,
they don't hate you.

654
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:08,237
They hate me.

655
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:13,402
Listen, that man
that you killed...

656
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:15,776
- Dr. Nathan's husband?
- Yeah.

657
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:19,271
That wasn't
your fault, okay?

658
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:21,308
Okay.

659
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:28,487
And Hamid Khan,

660
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:31,051
that was my doing, too.

661
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:34,292
All right?
You gotta know that, Cyril.

662
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,630
l'm guilty,

663
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,259
not you.

664
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:43,697
l remember
when l was little

665
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:47,871
Mama used to take us
to confession

666
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:51,575
and we'd go
in the big wooden box

667
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:55,143
and tell all our sins.

668
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:58,917
And Mama said
by telling God,

669
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:02,517
our sins were washed away.

670
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,524
Remember?

671
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:08,963
Yeah.

672
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,093
Yeah, l remember.

673
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:17,740
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.

674
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,708
Today, l lied.

675
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:25,409
l told someone l did something
that l didn't do.

676
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,453
Why?

677
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:32,081
Because it's what
she wanted to hear.

678
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:38,123
Because it's what she needs to know
to make herself whole again.

679
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:48,368
Fugitive Miguel Alvarez
continues to evade capture

680
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:50,966
as police widen their search
across the state.

681
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,873
Alvarez,
along with another prisoner,

682
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,470
Agamemnon Busmalis,
escaped...

683
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:57,538
Look who's out
of the hole.

684
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:59,776
Agamemnon
was recently captured

685
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:02,718
and returned to Oswald
earlier this week.

686
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,414
- How are you?
- What are you doing?

687
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,320
Anybody here from Cleveland?
All right.

688
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,855
Being free,
even for a few hours,

689
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:11,521
was so wonderful.

690
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:13,325
l mean, l had no money,
no overcoat,

691
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:16,822
it was cold out there,
but man, oh man,

692
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,734
l was so happy,
l stopped in the middle of the street

693
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,432
and did a little dance.

694
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,035
Of course,
that's when they caught me.

695
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,842
You were standing outside
Miss Sally's house.

696
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,371
Yeah, l was hoping to catch
a glimpse of her in the flesh,

697
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,384
maybe even exchange
a word or three.

698
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:37,182
- What the fuck happened to Alvarez?
- l don't know.

699
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:39,348
Soon as we crawled out
of the tunnel, he vamoosed.

700
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,087
You know what l miss
more than anything about being free?

701
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:45,857
Taking a bath.
l hate showers.

702
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:49,127
To sit and soak
in a hot tub,

703
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,760
- Bubbles everywhere.
- Bubbles.

704
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:57,166
l'll bet you even had a little
rubber ducky, huh, Nikolai?

705
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,301
Rubber ducky?

706
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:02,403
- Yeah.
- What is rubber ducky?

707
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:05,711
Product of capitalist
imperialism.

708
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,274
What do you miss most, Bob?

709
00:45:12,056 --> 00:45:14,251
l have nothing
to say to you.

710
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:23,127
Bob, please, talk to me.

711
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,533
This silence is grueling.

712
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:27,662
Why are you mad at me?

713
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:30,469
The fact that you don't know
makes the offense worse.

714
00:45:30,508 --> 00:45:32,738
You're pissed off
that l tried to escape?

715
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:35,678
l'm pissed off that
you didn't ask me to go with you.

716
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:38,238
- Oh.
- That you never ever told me

717
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:40,216
you were digging
another tunnel.

718
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,049
- Oh, well. l had my reasons.
- Which were?

719
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:44,281
- Well...
- What?

720
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:46,812
l thought
you'd slow me down.

721
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:50,088
- Slow you down?
- l'm sorry, Bob.

722
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:52,425
- l'm as vital as l ever was.
- l know.

723
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:55,364
- l killed a man.
- l know!

724
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:57,390
Fuck you.

725
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,063
Oh, shit.

726
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:05,699
Tomorrow at dawn,
Shirley Bellinger

727
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,473
will be executed for the drowning of her
eight-year-old daughter.

728
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:11,970
State law allows Bellinger the right
to choose her own means of death,

729
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:14,985
and Bellinger, the first woman
executed by the State

730
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:18,352
since 1841,
has asked to be hanged.

731
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:21,222
Man, l can't listen
to this fucking shit anymore.

732
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,524
Yeah, depress
the fuck out of me.

733
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:30,562
Adebisi, weren't you
in love with Bellinger?

734
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,535
No.

735
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,401
Yeah, you had a little
crush on her.

736
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:36,838
She had a crush on me.

737
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:38,933
lf l had to die,
l'd go lethal injection, man.

738
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:41,774
Me, l'd O.D.

739
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:45,339
An ounce or two of heroin,
straight up.

740
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,646
The State is not going
to give you drugs.

741
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:50,085
Ain't lethal injection a drug?

742
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:53,318
They get a doctor to decide where
the knot on the noose should be,

743
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:55,325
depending on the person's
height or weight,

744
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,260
so that the noose snaps
the neck in the right place?

745
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:02,254
l remember the day of my execution
l was terrified.

746
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,359
But then when l didn't die,

747
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:07,233
l felt like such a coward.

748
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:13,108
Anti-capital punishment
protesters continue to march

749
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:15,271
outside the prison,
though officials claim

750
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:17,678
the number is considerably
smaller than was expected.

751
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:19,580
Bye-bye Bellinger, huh?

752
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:23,144
Yeah. l was kind of hoping
to see her one more time,

753
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:25,985
but the hacks have delayed
all mail deliveries to death row

754
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:28,048
till after the execution.

755
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:32,290
She was quite a gal.
Reminds me of my late wife.

756
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:34,559
My Arlene.

757
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:41,133
She showed me her cunt.

758
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:44,198
l was mopping up the floor
outside her cell and wham, bam.

759
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:46,937
Showed me her cunt.

760
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,478
Next item:
Shirley Bellinger's execution

761
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:54,484
is scheduled
for dawn tomorrow.

762
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:57,316
- Bye.
- Peter Marie...

763
00:47:57,354 --> 00:48:00,721
No, no, no, Leo. l agreed that l
wouldn't protest publicly again,

764
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:03,420
but that doesn't mean l have to sit here
and listen to the grim details.

765
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,122
But Bellinger has asked you
to do something for her.

766
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:07,960
What?

767
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:10,865
After she's dead, she wants you
to collect her personal possessions.

768
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:12,994
She doesn't want anyone else
touching her things.

769
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:14,937
What am l supposed
to do with them?

770
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:16,906
Well, she says dispose
of them as you wish.

771
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:19,637
Okay. Can l go now?

772
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:22,540
Yeah.

773
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:27,083
Ray, she's asked for you
to pray with her.

774
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:30,148
Right.

775
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:34,883
Shirley, have you
any thoughts

776
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:37,223
- as the hour approaches?
- Thoughts?

777
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,752
Of course l have thoughts.
How could l not?

778
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:44,097
- Would you share them with us?
- Sure.

779
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:46,659
l'm wondering why anyone cares
what my thoughts are.

780
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:50,697
Sure as hell didn't care when
my husband was drunk and beat me

781
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:53,403
or when my father-in-law
raped me.

782
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:55,810
No, it wasn't until
l killed my daughter,

783
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:59,247
till l did something horrific
that what l think matters.

784
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:03,185
All l wanted was for someone
to pay attention,

785
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,415
and now that you
finally are,

786
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:09,893
l see that my life,
then or now, isn't worth shit.

787
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:16,064
Oh, if l say shit,
you can't use this, right?

788
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,001
l'm not supposed to say,
''shit,'' on the air, am l?

789
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:28,640
Aren't you curious to know who got
Shirley pregnant here in Oz?

790
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:33,640
No.

791
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:43,656
lt's time.

792
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:53,168
Good morning, sugar.

793
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:56,138
How you doing?

794
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:58,471
Woke up with a crick
in my neck.

795
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,500
Must've been sleeping funny.

796
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:03,479
- Maybe it's stress.
- ln any case,

797
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:05,607
the hanging'll
take care of the crick.

798
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:09,210
- What'd l-- what'd l miss?
- Nothing yet, Natalie.

799
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:12,552
- And Miles is sleeping?
- Yeah.

800
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,648
Man has no sense
of propriety.

801
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,756
So what'd you have
for your final meal?

802
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,890
A nice Slim-Fast milkshake.

803
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,957
Girl's got to
protect her figure,

804
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:25,866
even if she's a corpse.

805
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:39,211
Ready?

806
00:50:40,284 --> 00:50:41,911
Quite.

807
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:44,079
Sorry to get you up
so early, Father.

808
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:48,755
Warden, Officer Lopresti
has been coming

809
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,817
to my cell every night
and fucking me.

810
00:50:50,861 --> 00:50:54,297
- That's a lie.
- You and l will talk later.

811
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,128
Yes, sir.

812
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,634
- Bitch.
- You know that--

813
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:02,196
- Would you mind solving a mystery?
- lf l can.

814
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:08,337
When you got pregnant
here in Oz, who was the father?

815
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:11,075
- Was it Lopresti?
- Oh, no.

816
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:12,810
He wasn't working
death watch then.

817
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,785
My lover was Satan
in the form of a man.

818
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,878
Which man?

819
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:20,890
A lady never reveals
such secrets.

820
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:22,983
But l'll give you a hint.

821
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:27,892
Neither rain nor snow...

822
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:39,470
- Goodbye, Moses.
- So long, Shirley.

823
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:42,035
See you around, kiddo.

824
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,775
Save me a seat
at the beauty salon.

825
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:50,110
- The Lord is my shepherd...
- l shall not want.

826
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:52,315
He makes me lie
down in green pastures.

827
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:55,985
He leads me beside still waters.
He restores my soul.

828
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,033
He guides me in the paths
of righteousness

829
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:07,764
for His name's sake.

830
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,773
Even though l walk
through the valley

831
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:12,435
of the shadow of death,
l will fear no evil...

832
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:31,650
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

833
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:33,424
You anoint
my head with oil.

834
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:45,536
l will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

835
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,544
Amen.

836
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,633
No. No, no.

837
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:20,700
l changed my mind.
l don't want to die this way.

838
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:22,905
- l don't want to die.
- lt's too late.

839
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:24,937
- No. No.
- Shirley!

840
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:27,041
Please, please! No!

841
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:29,450
Please! Please.

842
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,018
No! Please, please!

843
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,718
Oh God, oh God!
Not yet!

844
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:37,784
Not yet, not yet,
not yet!

845
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:40,859
Oh, sweet heaven.

846
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:44,265
Oh, sweet Jesus.
l'm sorry for all l've done.

847
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:46,496
Please, please, please,
intercede for me now.

848
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:48,402
Oh, sweet Jesus.

849
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:51,271
Help me, sweet Jesus.
Help me, sweet Lord.

850
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:58,481
l'm sorry
for all l've done.

851
00:53:58,515 --> 00:54:01,075
Please, please,
please intercede for me now.

852
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:04,645
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, help me, Mary, Jesus.

853
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:31,281
Hey, Sister.

854
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:33,545
Can l have her mirror?

855
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:36,278
Sure.

856
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:42,585
l'm the next one to die,
you know.

857
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:46,187
Yes. l know.

858
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:55,405
The final act of mercy,

859
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:58,033
to bury the dead,
to pray for the dead

860
00:54:58,075 --> 00:55:01,738
and the living.
We are merciful,

861
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:03,905
not just for
humanitarian reasons.

862
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:08,043
We are merciful because
we ourselves want to be saved.

863
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:10,315
God expects mercy from us.

864
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:11,981
God demands it.

865
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:14,547
And how much mercy
does he show us?

866
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,560
''Kyrie eleison.''

867
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:22,895
That means
''Lord have mercy.

868
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:25,128
Christ have mercy.

869
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:26,760
Please.''
