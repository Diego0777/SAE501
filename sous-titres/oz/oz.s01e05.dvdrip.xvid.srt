1
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:43,483
Floods.

2
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:46,657
You know how you always hear
about them people in lowa or Missouri

3
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,198
or wherever,
how some big river overflows?

4
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:52,662
The fucking water keeps pouring
over its riverbanks, out of control,

5
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:56,912
taking out farms and towns
and everything in its path.

6
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,252
Everybody tries to stop it,
but nobody can.

7
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:06,633
Everybody's lives are wiped out.

8
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,675
Completely destroyed.

9
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:15,971
And the fucking river,
it don't give a shit.

10
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,939
lt just keeps rising.

11
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:30,443
Year after year
after fucked-up year.

12
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:35,952
My question is, are them heads
in the Midwest whacked out or what?

13
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,040
This one joker l seen on TV,

14
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,701
his home had been washed away
four times.

15
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,839
Four fucking times.
Why don't he just leave?

16
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:47,798
Why don't he jump in that pickup
and drive to higher ground?

17
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:50,004
Or is he like us in Oz?

18
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,296
There ain't no higher ground.

19
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,571
Hey!

20
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:14,781
Yeah, what l'm saying is
that your officers are doing a shit job.

21
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:16,871
The whole concept
behind Emerald City

22
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,784
is that we never
take our eyes off anyone.

23
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,164
We don't.

24
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:23,295
Then how do you explain Beecher
getting a swastika burned onto his ass,

25
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,670
or Miguel Alvarez
cutting his face all up,

26
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:29,086
or inmates using classrooms
to snort fucking heroin?

27
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,969
lt's life, Tim. Shit slides through.

28
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,552
lf you got a problem
with the way l run things, replace me.

29
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,308
You know l'm not gonna do that,
Diane.

30
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,354
Why?
Because we're fucking each other?

31
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:43,936
Sorry we're late.

32
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:45,604
lf you ever got here
on time, McManus,

33
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:47,320
l think l'd have a heart attack.

34
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,487
- What are we talking about?
- Drugs.

35
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,157
My favourite topic.

36
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,237
The more we try and stop the drugs,
the more the drugs get in.

37
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:56,660
What do you expect?
Outside, they're sentencing dealers

38
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,283
to much longer prison time.

39
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,159
Yeah, we got a prison full of guys

40
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,825
who are experts
at moving shit through any system.

41
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:06,663
Schibetta's got the biggest operation.
We stop him, we make a major dent.

42
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,456
McManus, you wanted Schibetta
in Em City.

43
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:11,669
- You said you could reach him.
- l will, in time.

44
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:14,425
Unfortunately, that's one
of the many things we don't have.

45
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,724
l know. When it comes to drugs,
there are two major players involved:

46
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,936
Nino Schibetta and Kareem Said.

47
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:23,851
- Muslims are anti-drugs.
- Exactly.

48
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:27,850
- We want your help stopping the flow.
- That's your job, not mine.

49
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,564
You know everything
about this place.

50
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,654
You could tell us
the whens and the wheres.

51
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:34,701
Yeah, and end up dead.

52
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,369
No, thank you.

53
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,618
l have to take care
of this disease my own way.

54
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:42,531
- Which is...?
- By fighting the addiction.

55
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:46,203
Well, you see, that's what l'm trying
to do with my counselling sessions.

56
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:50,122
You know, you and l
have exact same goals, Kareem.

57
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:54,589
Only because of who we are, we can't
help each other achieve these goals.

58
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:58,423
So more inmates get hurt. lt's--

59
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:01,180
lt is so frustrating.

60
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:04,562
Sister, we both believe
in a greater power.

61
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,316
His will be done.

62
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,106
His will or yours?

63
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:11,396
Yeah, well, in my experience,

64
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:14,069
God isn't too helpful
unless you give him a little nudge.

65
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,828
What now?

66
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:28,460
Schibetta's drugs
fuck with people's heads.

67
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:31,170
lt's time l start fucking with his.

68
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,542
The last couple of weeks
have been tough on you, Nino.

69
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,635
Your wife dying,

70
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:39,304
Dino murdered,
Joey D'Angelo out of commission.

71
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:41,225
Overall, your troops,
they're thinning.

72
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:45,219
They're getting older,
they're more anaemic.

73
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,479
Now, the blacks and Latinos
are taking over,

74
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,898
on the street and in here.

75
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,610
So we gotta face it,
the days of the Mafia are over.

76
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,491
Okay, okay.

77
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:04,408
Let's just say that you're of an age,
you ought to start to relax a little bit.

78
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,492
Now, l got a friend, DEA.

79
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,372
He says you wanna talk,
he'll make a deal.

80
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,381
A deal?

81
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,797
What's he gonna do,
put me in Witness Protection?

82
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,170
You are a fool, McManus.

83
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,133
Now, you can try
for the next thousand years

84
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,058
not to be a fool,
but you'll always be one.

85
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,308
Well, l can't change neither.

86
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:30,017
l can't turn my back on who l am.
Certainly not for you.

87
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:34,184
Certainly not for
some dumb-ass DEA deal.

88
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:39,817
- You done with me?
- For now.

89
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:46,157
Attention. The following inmates
are to be transferred immediately.

90
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,948
As l call your name,
gather your belongings

91
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,373
and form a line
by Officer Vogelsang.

92
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:58,343
88P7 1 5, Ottovino.

93
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:04,973
91 J224, Jenbro.

94
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:09,137
85P661 , Pellicano.

95
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:15,937
94R51 1 , Ricatta.

96
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,158
Arrivederci, baby.

97
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,201
Bye-bye.

98
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,369
Looks like Nino's all alone.

99
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,232
Get out of here.

100
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,279
Chocolate bars.

101
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,493
- With almonds or without?
- Both.

102
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,330
You got it.

103
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:16,749
You've been handling things pretty good
around here since Joey's accident.

104
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:20,008
- Hey, you do what you gotta do.
- That's right.

105
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,591
The bad blood
between you boys and us,

106
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:28,636
well, with Jefferson Keane cold,
l'm willing to let bygones be gone.

107
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:30,347
Yeah, me too.

108
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:33,232
- You like tits?
- Who doesn't?

109
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,019
My tits are firm and round.
Maybe you could suck my tits.

110
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,609
l know a lot of brothers
who would love to.

111
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,651
lf you fuck me over,
l'll cut this hand off.

112
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,210
What was all that about?

113
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,130
The future, my brother.

114
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:06,968
Us owning the future.

115
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:11,769
Tits.

116
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,977
That's what we call drugs.

117
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,611
Sixty percent of the violence in prison
is due to tits.

118
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,316
Either people not paying their debts,
or people trying to control the traffic.

119
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,526
The traffic.

120
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:28,238
Here in Oz, the last few days,

121
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:31,448
the traffic has been
bumper-to-bumper.

122
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,838
Prisoner number 94P442,
Ronald Poklewaldt.

123
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:50,888
Convicted March 8th, '94.
Arson in the second degree.

124
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:56,772
Sentence: 25 years.
Up for parole in ten.

125
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,618
--so that we can have
a couple of fucking hits, you know.

126
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,582
Just couple of tits.

127
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,373
Don't touch me.

128
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,664
So you're hiding behind
the bitch's skirt now, huh?

129
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:24,373
- You hurt me, she'll see you.
- Just want our money.

130
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:28,425
- Next week l'm getting a cheque.
- See, you said that last week.

131
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,506
l know, l know, l know, but l can't
be held responsible for the U.S. mail.

132
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:36,644
- Shit!
- Yo, Adebisi. Yo, let's go.

133
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:40,147
- No money, no tits.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:50,859
Tomorrow we get healthy.
l want you boys ready to--

135
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:53,996
- Who you calling ''boys'', old man?
- Shut the fuck up. Take a walk.

136
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:57,291
- How you gonna let him just call--?
- Be gone, little nigger.

137
00:10:58,461 --> 00:10:59,836
We have to talk.

138
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:04,245
Look, Nino, l wanna be there
when the shit comes in.

139
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,424
- Where's it happen?
- Sorry.

140
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:10,004
lt's an old family recipe.
We don't share.

141
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,133
Hey, if we gonna be partners, yo,

142
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:15,178
we just ought to be up
on how big a risk we gotta take.

143
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:19,136
- Just knowing it works ain't enough?
- No, man.

144
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,269
All right.

145
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,571
So how's it work, Nino?

146
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:33,404
We know it doesn't go
through the kitchen,

147
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,073
otherwise we'd have seen it.

148
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:37,116
Kitchen's the first place
the cops would look.

149
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,702
No, we use the post office.

150
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,415
Hold this.

151
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:48,382
A box of socks from my sister.

152
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:50,800
Versace.

153
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,008
lt's an old trick.

154
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,632
lt still works.

155
00:11:56,852 --> 00:12:00,601
- Yeah, but where do you cut it?
- Here.

156
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:04,106
Here? Here, where?

157
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,358
l ain't telling you everything.

158
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,438
At least not until
we've been in business a little longer.

159
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,618
All right.

160
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:15,822
Cool.

161
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:20,706
Fuck him. l don't wanna do
no business with no dago.

162
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,160
- Hey, how's it going?
- Man, we won't be for long.

163
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,917
Look, Schibetta's weak.
He done already lost a lot of his men.

164
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:29,999
All we got to do is find out
how his operation works,

165
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:31,256
then we take it over.

166
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,930
- Nino?
- Yeah?

167
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,298
My offer still stands.
l wanna be here for you.

168
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:40,811
- l wanna help you any way l can.
- Okay, kid, thanks.

169
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:47,400
- l said ''okay,'' okay?
- Okay.

170
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:56,657
l'll testify against Adebisi,
Markstrom and Wangler.

171
00:12:56,996 --> 00:12:59,831
We need to figure out
how the drugs are getting in.

172
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,116
You got any idea
how the gangsters are doing it?

173
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:05,869
No. No, l don't. l don't.

174
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,337
You find out, you let me know.

175
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:09,924
Oh, l'll find out all right,

176
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:13,135
and then l want you
to bust Adebisi's ass.

177
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:15,470
Ronnie.

178
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,056
Been to drug counselling recently?

179
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,508
Sure, sure. l go all the time.

180
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:22,556
Sister Peter Marie says
you haven't been there for two weeks.

181
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,399
l'll go today. l promise.

182
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,835
Get lost, punk.
You aren't squeezing my tits anymore.

183
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:49,916
- You never pay.
- No, no, no, that's not why l'm here.

184
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:53,715
Markstrom and his crew,
how do they get their shit into Oz?

185
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:58,337
What are you doing?
You doing market research now, huh?

186
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:02,140
No, man, l'm looking
to fuck those niggers up.

187
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:07,980
Well, l don't know how they do it,
but l got a couple of guesses.

188
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:10,149
Sit your ass down.

189
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:48,147
Nino, let's talk about this, man.

190
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,810
Come on.

191
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,644
- You stay out.
- lt's all right, Kenny.

192
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,275
lt's all right.

193
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,700
Me and my associates are very
unhappy about this morning's events.

194
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,245
- How did this happen?
- Nino--

195
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,820
My operation's been running
smooth as a silk shirt.

196
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,662
Then l tell you what's what,
suddenly the hacks know.

197
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:10,165
l gotta wonder
if one of your boys is the jabber.

198
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,000
- Oh, come on, man, that's impossible.
- Anything is possible.

199
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:17,047
You wanna stay in business with me?
Find the leak and plug the leak today.

200
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:20,844
Nino, don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it, all right?

201
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,892
Come on.

202
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:26,224
Adebisi, stay.

203
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,518
- What's that?
- l don't know, man, but watch him.

204
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:34,102
Secrets. We all got secrets.

205
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,567
Mostly our secrets are tied
to our addictions, our obsessions.

206
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:43,025
You like that bourbon too much?
You get off eating chicks with dicks.

207
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,573
You gotta do it in hiding.

208
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:49,081
You say you somebody
but you really somebody else.

209
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:54,081
Only things that matter to us most,
do we keep our secrets?

210
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,709
And sometimes...

211
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,381
...those secrets will kill you.

212
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,854
Fuck.

213
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:13,598
Cut him down.

214
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,609
All right.

215
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,732
Markstrom didn't strike me
as the suicide type.

216
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,611
He wasn't.

217
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,779
- l'm sorry, Leo.
- For what?

218
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:28,990
- He was your cousin.
- Not my cousin.

219
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,331
What are you talking about?
That's what you told me.

220
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,038
That's why you wanted him
in Em City.

221
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,171
He's not my cousin.
He's a narc, undercover cop.

222
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:38,209
You put an undercover cop
in my cellblock

223
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,169
and you don't even
fucking mention it to me?

224
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:42,628
Look, l'm trying to put some brakes
on the drug traffic.

225
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:44,471
l get city Narcotics to send in a man,

226
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,680
l figure the less people
know about it, the better.

227
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,594
Even so,
you should have told me, Leo.

228
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,474
And what? Listen to you lecture
on prisoners' rights?

229
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:52,887
About entrapment? No, thanks.

230
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,559
So let me get this straight.

231
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:57,100
Markstrom's been
feeding you info all along.

232
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,645
The idea was to get him in good
with the gangsters,

233
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,236
get him to find out
about their operation.

234
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:04,526
- But somebody gave him up.
- Yeah, who?

235
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:08,575
One of his bunkies in Narcotics
must be talking to the mob.

236
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:11,666
What? Oh, yes, governor.

237
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,331
Yes. Yeah, l know.

238
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:16,962
Goodbye.

239
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,967
This time, he wants a lockdown.

240
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:23,211
Oh, Devlin's fighting
for his political life.

241
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,386
Trying to take the focus off him,
put it on us.

242
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:28,343
Yeah, l know. But the bottom line is,
l was gonna do it anyway.

243
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,177
Until we nail whoever's responsible
for Markstrom's murder,

244
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,267
l'm locking Oz down, tight.

245
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:39,192
Man, who would have thought
Markstrom was a cop?

246
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,945
- Makes you sick, don't it?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,860
Makes you wonder
who else is undercover.

248
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:45,866
Could be anybody.

249
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:53,284
Could be you.

250
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:56,083
Could be you.

251
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,713
Hey, Nino.

252
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,001
The hacks didn't buy
Markstrom's suicide.

253
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:06,753
l didn't they think would.
lt was more a sign to Glynn:

254
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:08,301
Don't fuck with us.

255
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:12,679
Yeah, now they're gonna lock down
this whole fucking place.

256
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:14,223
For a little while.

257
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:18,267
And your smuggling operation,
it's busted.

258
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:22,897
The post-office thing?
That's not the way we really do it.

259
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:25,901
That was just a test
to see what you boys are made of.

260
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:29,660
The truth is,
l'd never tell you the truth.

261
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:32,866
- Oh, yeah?
- Now,

262
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:37,495
the fastest way to end this lockdown
is to pick one of your gang

263
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,831
and have him cop
to the Markstrom hanging.

264
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,165
Okay.

265
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:48,839
l always thought Keane and Markstrom
were holding you back.

266
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:52,010
From the get-go,
l knew you were a guy

267
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:55,138
who sees how the world gets made.

268
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,561
Adebisi.

269
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:03,020
Ends in l.
You sure you're not ltalian?

270
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,942
Schibetta ends in A.
Maybe you African.

271
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,742
Lockdown, gentlemen, lockdown.

272
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,462
Today, Adebisi.

273
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:30,218
''Lockdown, gentlemen, lockdown.''

274
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:43,309
Man, l fucking hate lockdowns.

275
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,278
Not because of being trapped
in this fucking fishbowl.

276
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:51,199
Man.

277
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:54,864
l start fiending for some fucking tits.

278
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,366
You a tit boy, Groves?

279
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:02,420
- Drugs are bad.
- That's bullshit.

280
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,915
Man, you had to be fucked up
when you ate your mother.

281
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:09,253
- Mom told me that drugs were bad.
- Right.

282
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,008
l bet you was, like,
a good little boy, right?

283
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:15,177
Did everything
your mama told you to.

284
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:20,268
l like your scars.

285
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,151
Now l know why McManus
put us in the same cell together.

286
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,898
You're the only motherfucker
in Em City

287
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:30,563
who's more fucked up than l am.

288
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,574
Here.

289
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,278
l don't wanna write
anybody a fucking letter, all right?

290
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:39,124
- l wanna get fucking high.
- You lick the back.

291
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,491
Yeah. Lick the back.

292
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:43,537
lt's...

293
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,504
...liquid LSD.

294
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:53,467
Groves. Groves.

295
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,475
You give stamp collecting
a whole new meaning, baby.

296
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:02,470
l don't have to tell you, drugs ain't
the only things to get addicted to.

297
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,648
Some people mainline their work,
some people...snort ESPN.

298
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:10,187
Some people needle-pop gambling.

299
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:15,649
There are those that shoot up
junk foods, fine wines, Cohibas, baby.

300
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:17,986
Some people get hooked on love.

301
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:22,583
And like any fiend on the street,
you always need another bump.

302
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:27,710
Just one more bump, man,
just one more bump.

303
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:38,259
- Hey.
- Hi.

304
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,020
What's the matter?

305
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:46,772
Markstrom was murdered.

306
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:49,064
He was a cop.

307
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,528
l feel responsible.

308
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:55,024
Diane, Van Harris confessed
to the murder.

309
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:57,116
Yeah, well, even so.

310
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:59,611
Maybe you're right.
Maybe l am doing a shit job here.

311
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,202
You know what? l got an idea.

312
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,824
Tonight after work,
you come to my place.

313
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:06,787
Oh, l can't, l gotta drive home.

314
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:09,542
Mom says Didi's been acting up.

315
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:11,999
l wanna meet your daughter.

316
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,713
Why don't you bring her into town,
three of us will go to dinner?

317
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,388
Then what do l do with her?

318
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:18,973
This isn't exactly

319
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:21,928
a take-your-daughter-to-work
kind of place.

320
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:26,348
- l love you, Diane.
- Do you?

321
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:30,475
No, you're supposed to say,
''l love you too, Tim.''

322
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:37,523
The night of Keane's execution,
you know, what we did...

323
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:40,236
...it was really fucked up.

324
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:43,953
And l don't know why.

325
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:47,908
l don't know if it's loneliness.

326
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:51,542
Why does the why matter?

327
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,298
Well, it doesn't, does it?

328
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:07,938
l came up here to get the file
on the new arrival.

329
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:15,195
- His name is Scott Ross.
- Scott Ross?

330
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,825
- Oh, shit.
- ls there a problem?

331
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:21,739
No, it's nothing l can't handle.

332
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:39,629
Prisoner number 9 7 R5 1 8,
Scott Ross.

333
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:41,970
Convicted June 4th, '9 7.

334
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:45,302

with intent to distribute.

335
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,015
Third conviction.
Sentence: life without parole.

336
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:53,317
Three strikes, sucker!

337
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,645
- Wait here.
- Sure.

338
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:04,035
Since when you been working Oz?

339
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,120
About six months.

340
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:10,412
- This is great.
- No, no, it's not.

341
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:13,498
Always dreamed
of you having me in cuffs.

342
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,457
Look.

343
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,001
Just because we knew each other
in a former life,

344
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:20,882
doesn't mean you're gonna get
any special treatment.

345
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:24,097
- l love it when you play tough.
- l'm not playing, Scott.

346
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:27,262
Mack. Mark Mack, Scott Ross.

347
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:30,977
Mack is your sponsor. He'll help you
get acquainted with the rules.

348
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,313
Take him to Em City.

349
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:35,894
You knew her on the outside?

350
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,190
Yeah. Me and her ex
used to ride together.

351
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,255
ln there. Top bunk, all right?

352
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:10,683
All right, gentlemen,
the lockdown is over.

353
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,251
Hey.

354
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,747
Hey.

355
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:42,631
l'm gonna give you ten minutes
to get your hands off my dick.

356
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:49,014
- Schillinger, you fuck.
- Scotty, how long you in for?

357
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,804
Life.

358
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:53,184
Oh, man.

359
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:55,559
What?

360
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:58,147
Come on. You got any cigarettes?

361
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:09,950
- No smoking. Put the butt out.
- Diane.

362
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,700
l'm not asking
for any special favours,

363
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,413
but we've known each other
for a long time.

364
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:20,455
Have we? l was married to Glen
for four fun-filled years.

365
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:23,759
During that time, you were finishing off
a six-year sentence.

366
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:27,338
We were on the road together
maybe five months?

367
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:29,924
They were a great five months.

368
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:32,557
All you did was come on to me.

369
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,771
lf Glen hadn't been so fucked up
on coke, he'd have noticed.

370
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:38,437
l was a man in love. l still am.

371
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:40,524
Oh, please.
Save it for the shower room.

372
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:42,563
Diane, l know
what your life is like now,

373
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,938
raising a kid on your own,
working in this shithouse.

374
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:48,235
l hear you're doing double shifts
just because you need the money.

375
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:52,028
l got a way to make you money.

376
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:56,285
You're looking out
for my best interests, huh?

377
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:58,336
Yeah.

378
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:01,665
Like l said, save it.

379
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:06,799
Get your ass back to Em City.

380
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,338
Next item: overtime.

381
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:11,099
The good news is,

382
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:14,137
based on the successful conclusion
of negotiations

383
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:17,597
between the Department of Correction
and the Officers' Union,

384
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:19,267
we have a contract.

385
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:26,613
The bad news is, because
the overtime rate is now so high,

386
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:28,104
the commissioner has decided

387
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:32,032
to no longer allow officers
to work double shifts.

388
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:35,457
What? This sucks.

389
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,789
The department gave in
to the union's demands,

390
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:39,911
knowing they never intended
to pay any overtime?

391
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:41,920
Hey. That's how deals get made.

392
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:43,958
Hey, what are you complaining about,
Lady Di?

393
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:47,010
lt frees you up to spend more time
with your boyfriend.

394
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:49,506
What are you talking about?

395
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,762
Yeah, Healy,
what are you trying to say?

396
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:54,638
You two wanna pretend
you're not fucking each other, fine.

397
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:57,094
You're a funny guy, you know that?

398
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:00,230
- Knock it off, you two!
- Come on, tough guy.

399
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,400
McManus. McManus, sit down.

400
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:06,644
- You fucking prick.
- Sit down.

401
00:28:06,864 --> 00:28:11,111
Healy, keep your comments
to yourself.

402
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:14,871
Next item.

403
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:23,210
- Fuck them.
- No, Timmy, it's not that easy.

404
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:25,331
Like it or not,
we work with these people.

405
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:27,915
lf they don't respect us,
it makes the day ten times harder.

406
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:30,543
Are you saying
we can't see each other anymore?

407
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:33,295
Look, this job is all l have.
Do you understand that?

408
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:36,843
You have a college education,
a bigtime reputation.

409
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,931
lf l lose this, it's back
to cleaning other people's houses.

410
00:28:40,147 --> 00:28:41,891
lt's welfare.

411
00:28:42,107 --> 00:28:44,681
l have a daughter to feed
and a mother getting old.

412
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:47,227
- l can give you money.
- You have alimony and a mortgage,

413
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:49,902
you can't afford to take me on.
And l wouldn't want you to.

414
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:52,192
- Please--
- No, l'll see you, Tim.

415
00:28:57,248 --> 00:29:00,664
You and me both know
cigarettes is money in the joint.

416
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,583
Want someone to do your laundry,
a couple of sticks.

417
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,465
Want someone to get rolled,
a carton or two,

418
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:09,004
depending on who it is.

419
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,512
Problem is,
they got a really short shelf life.

420
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:17,345
You can't hoard them,
you gotta keep them moving.

421
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:22,180
Supply and demand, baby,
that's what l'm talking about.

422
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,354
- l bring them in, you sell them.
- A carton a day, that's it.

423
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:32,739
Come on, what do you say?

424
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:37,530
Okay.

425
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:42,996
- Put the cigarette out.
- That's my baby.

426
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:58,471
Not all drugs are recreational.

427
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:02,219
Some are benign,
or supposedly benign.

428
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,561
l got the final results back
from your tests.

429
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:07,774
You're suffering from hypertension.

430
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:12,279
Curse of my people.

431
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,859
African-Americans are genetically
predisposed to the condition.

432
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,116
No, doctor, it's not genetics.

433
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:20,405
High blood pressure
is caused by racism.

434
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:22,615
There are some studies out
suggesting a link

435
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,455
between racial discrimination
and hypertension,

436
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:27,579
but the data is inconclusive.

437
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,706
Well, it may be inconclusive
to the scientists,

438
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:31,715
but l know that it's a fact.

439
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:33,336
Men of colour in the working class

440
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:35,254
have a higher blood pressure
than whites,

441
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:37,878
or even black professionals. Why?

442
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:41,384
Because we are forced
to accept unfair treatment, doctor.

443
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:45,351
l'm not really interested in the politics,
Said, l care about your health.

444
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:46,721
And if we don't do something,

445
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:50,482
you're headed for heart disease,
stroke, damage to the other organs.

446
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:53,856
So l'm going to prescribe
some Tenormin.

447
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:56,690
What are the side effects?

448
00:30:57,535 --> 00:31:01,367
Low heartbeat, light-headedness
if you stand up too quickly.

449
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,448
That won't do.
Daily, l kneel and l pray to Mecca.

450
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:07,369
- What else do you have?
- Calan.

451
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,880
Constipation, nausea, dizziness.

452
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,126
No. My mind must function clearly.

453
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,964
All drugs have side effects.

454
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,884
Perhaps that's God's way of telling us
we shouldn't be taking them.

455
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,804
You have to take something
or you'll die.

456
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:28,603
Believe me, doctor,
l have no intention of dying.

457
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,895
Can l go now?

458
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,521
Sure.

459
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:56,049
l'm sorry that you're ill.

460
00:31:57,052 --> 00:32:00,552
- And who told you that l was ill?
- God.

461
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:05,303
Oh, yes. You talk to God.

462
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,595
When he's in town.

463
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:11,811
Well, in lslam, we believe that only
two people spoke to God directly:

464
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:16,189
Mohammad, and praise be to him,
and Moses.

465
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:18,564
So, you see,
you are in excellent company.

466
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:21,618
- You think l'm lying or deluded.
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,066
l may well be.

468
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:26,870
l do know sometimes
l can see inside men's souls.

469
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,242
And can you see into mine,
old man?

470
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,414
- Yes.
- And what is there?

471
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,378
- Anger.
- Yes, l am angry.

472
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:40,127
l am angry at a society
that cripples my people,

473
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,469
that infects their bodies.

474
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:45,433
No, you're angry at God.

475
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:49,810
l am not.

476
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:52,140
My illness is Allah's will.

477
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:55,193
And l accept the bad as well
as the good that God gives me.

478
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:58,440
Still, you're angry at him, and afraid.

479
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:01,063
Afraid of dying.

480
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:04,157
That is not true.

481
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:07,704
You watched Jefferson Keane die,
die gladly.

482
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:10,702
Keane embraced death like a lover,
like a traveller going home.

483
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:15,295
You saw that and were afraid.
You realised you aren't as willing to go.

484
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:18,414
Get out of here, old man.

485
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:23,423
Get out.

486
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:49,283
The ever-increasing scandal
surrounding Governor James Devlin

487
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:52,072
accepting kickbacks
took another bizarre turn today,

488
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:55,709
when his wife, Evangeline Devlin,
moved out of the governor's mansion.

489
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:57,665
Though no official word
has been given,

490
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,090
sources say that Mrs. Devlin
has learned of an affair between--

491
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:04,338
- The doctor told me what's going on.
- That is not your concern, McManus.

492
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:06,548
He told me
you won't take your medication.

493
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:09,339
l haven't decided anything as yet.

494
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,181
Well, you don't have a choice.
Take the drugs.

495
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:13,725
And what if l refuse?

496
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,807
- l'll force you to.
- How?

497
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:17,181
l'll open up your mouth

498
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,277
and stuff the pills
down your throat myself.

499
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:26,739
- Okay, let's make that deal, McManus.
- You know what l want.

500
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:30,238
l can't tell you much about
how the drugs come into Oz,

501
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:34,785
except to say
look at your own house.

502
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:36,745
What's that mean?

503
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,850
- That's a pretty big accusation.
- Not really.

504
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,140
Look, there are plenty of examples of
officers smuggling drugs into prisons.

505
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:59,399
Soledad, Attica, here at Oz in '82.

506
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,270
l remember. l was working solitary.

507
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,894
- Two of my best friends got busted.
- So then...?

508
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:05,822
- l'll start an investigation.
- Good.

509
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:10,825
Of the entire staff. Everyone
from the officers to the librarian to you.

510
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:13,909
l'll take it slow, because if it's true,
l don't wanna spook them.

511
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:16,698
l wanna be able
to make the charges stick.

512
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,910
- Hey, Roger.
- Hey, morning, Mike.

513
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:22,835
- See the Toronto game?
- Yeah, Gaston's a spaz.

514
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,458
- How much you lose?
- Don't ask.

515
00:35:31,183 --> 00:35:33,853
Hey, Diane.

516
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:37,062
- You heading out?
- Yeah.

517
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,977
These graveyard shifts
are killing me.

518
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:06,332
- O'Reily.
-Yeah.

519
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,541
Go see Schibetta.

520
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,511
Since when are you
his Western Union?

521
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:11,133
Since we partners,

522
00:36:11,348 --> 00:36:12,677
he and l.

523
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,846
You're the monkey
chained to his organ grinder.

524
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,141
Better watch that pretty little ass.

525
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:21,687
No need.
You're too busy watching it for me.

526
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,101
And keep your fucking hands
off me.

527
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:27,481
l'm scared of you.

528
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,657
You wanted to see me, Nino?

529
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,401
Yeah, come on in.

530
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:36,328
No, thanks.
l've never been big on tomatoes.

531
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,582
You lrish. You got no appreciation
for the simple things in life.

532
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:45,579
- What's simpler than a potato?
- Sit.

533
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:50,967
You been saying if l need it,
you'd be willing to help out.

534
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,880
Anything. You know Adebisi's gonna
shank you the first chance he gets.

535
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,342
Don't you worry about Adebisi.

536
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,474
He's a mongrel, but effective.

537
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:04,692
From you, l need
a more sophisticated favour.

538
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:07,819
l need to close down
Healy's drug operation.

539
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,153
Healy? Officer Healy?

540
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:12,821
Don't say you know nothing about it.

541
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:15,282
Your brother and Healy are friends.

542
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,868
Healy's been your archangel
since you got to Oz.

543
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,076
- You've been running tits for him.
- You know, l don't know what you're--

544
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,825
l don't hold it against you.
l'd have done the same.

545
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:26,580
Only Healy's business
is starting to cut into mine,

546
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,835
and that l can't have happen.

547
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:32,924
So l am looking to you
for assistance.

548
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,882
- You want me to set him up?
- Yeah.

549
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:36,884
lf you do,

550
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:39,473
l promise l'll take care of you.
What do you say?

551
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:42,639
He's been good to me.

552
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,680
ls that your answer?

553
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,194
l'll do it.

554
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:56,572
So, what's the plan?

555
00:37:56,745 --> 00:37:58,156
The plan is up to you.

556
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:01,665
l don't care about the hows.
Just get it done.

557
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,294
All right.

558
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:15,553
- l need more tits.
- Oh, yeah?

559
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:17,638
l gave you a huge pair
a couple of days ago.

560
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,889
What can l say?
We go braless in Em City.

561
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:22,225
When can you get me some more?

562
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:23,933
Later.

563
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:32,406
- Yo, you looking for me?
- Yeah.

564
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:35,319
- How'd you like some tits for free?
- l don't kill.

565
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:38,204
- You don't have to kill.
- What do you want me to do?

566
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,493
Go see your pals upstairs.

567
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:41,862
And tell them what?

568
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,117
Tell them that you found
another drug connection.

569
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:47,454
- Well, who you gonna bust this time?
- Me.

570
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:00,557
Man.

571
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:02,351
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

572
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,895
l got him, l got him.

573
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:05,937
Hold on.

574
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,813
- Take O'Reily to the hole.
- You're fucking dead!

575
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,652
You're a fucking fag!

576
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:13,855
Hey, McManus!
Get him out of here!

577
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:16,362
Hey. That's going on your record.

578
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,775
Big fucking deal.

579
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:24,366
l gave this place everything l had.

580
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:27,792
And then you decided it was time
to take everything you could.

581
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:31,004
Look, l know working here's
no paradise,

582
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:35,082
but you swore an oath
and you broke that oath!

583
00:39:35,302 --> 00:39:37,591
l got no sympathy for you.

584
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:39,596
- Get him away from me.
- You wait, warden.

585
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:42,559
Wait till you need somebody like me
to back you up. l won't be here.

586
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:45,306
Then you can
kiss your ass goodbye.

587
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:56,946
- Will you testify against Healy?
- No.

588
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:58,950
l jabber on him,

589
00:39:59,118 --> 00:40:01,823
every other hack will be waiting in line
to take a whack at me too.

590
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:04,783
Fine. Officer Hunt?

591
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,038
See you in a month, O'Reily.

592
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:17,718
Hey, O'Reily,
any idea who ratted on Healy?

593
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:21,171
Beats the shit out of me.

594
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,964
But if l were a betting man,

595
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,644
l'd put my money on Poklewaldt.

596
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:37,566
Coming through.
Come on, back up. Back up.

597
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,732
Patient's name
is Ronald Poklewaldt.

598
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,785
- lt's severe head trauma.
- How are the vital signs?

599
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:44,745
Got a lot of blood.
Gonna have to get blood.

600
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,882
Let me out of here!

601
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:14,356
You're done.

602
00:41:15,444 --> 00:41:17,484
Piece of cake.

603
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:34,378
No. Who is this fucking Pinocchio?

604
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:36,711
l don't play games.

605
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:40,708
How do you keep that hat
on your head? Velcro?

606
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:42,506
- Deal me in.
- You play Pinochle?

607
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,803
No, l can learn.

608
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:47,929
Adebisi, l'll see you later.

609
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:59,320
Okay, each player gets 1 2 cards.

610
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,946
One card face up,
that's the trump card.

611
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:05,240
There's two ways to score.

612
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:13,999
You're in a mood.

613
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:20,715
l'm in a mood, all right.

614
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:23,464
l'm in a mood to kill.

615
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,252
Anybody in particular?

616
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:32,979
Mick and dago.

617
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:38,187
Yeah, well, l could go
for a piece of Schibetta's ass myself.

618
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:42,277
Yeah? Well, stick around,
little brother.

619
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:45,989
When the time is right,
he's all yours.

620
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,738
He's all mine.

621
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:53,285
You take a drug, right?

622
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,458
The chemicals,
they rush through your body,

623
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:57,585
rush through your brain.

624
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:00,424
And the sensations,
you want the sensations

625
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:02,590
again and again and again.

626
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:08,306
But let me tell you, you can also
get addicted to grief, to guilt, to hate.

627
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:10,592
Because when you feel dead inside,

628
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,558
even bad sensations
make you feel like you're alive!

629
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,198
What, that's it? No good-night kiss?

630
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,829
l'm beginning to think
you don't love me anymore.

631
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,702
l do.

632
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:40,205
- Say it. Say you love me.
- l love you.

633
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:44,171
No, you see, you said it
but you didn't mean it.

634
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:45,879
l do mean it, sir.

635
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:49,962
No, l'm telling you, the romance
has gone out of our relationship.

636
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:54,092
But l have the cure.

637
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,849
l was saving this for your birthday,

638
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:00,521
but, hell, l think we need it now.

639
00:44:02,027 --> 00:44:03,771
No, thanks.

640
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:07,315
Come on,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

641
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:10,368
You know what happens
when you hurt my feelings.

642
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:15,950
Put some on.

643
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,833
No.

644
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:20,247
Okay.

645
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:23,629
Hey, l understand.
You wanna surprise me.

646
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:29,256
Gonna wait for a special occasion
to get yourself all prettied up.

647
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,176
That is so sweet.

648
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,804
Hey, l can wait.

649
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:39,179
Not too long.

650
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:26,186
What? A nun can't look beautiful?

651
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:37,696
- Tobias, are you all right?
- Sure.

652
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,834
Think l'm blind?
l'm a drug counsellor, for God's sake.

653
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,170
lf l can't spot the signs,
l might as well tear up my licence.

654
00:45:51,387 --> 00:45:53,296
l don't know
what you're talking about.

655
00:45:54,431 --> 00:45:56,139
Listen.

656
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:59,300
l know how hideous life is in Oz,

657
00:45:59,478 --> 00:46:02,230
especially for a man like you
with no streets skills,

658
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:04,141
no preparation for the reality of it all,

659
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:08,687
but Tobias, Tobias,
drugs are not the answer.

660
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:12,273
They only make the questions
more difficult.

661
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:19,491
l want you to start coming
to counselling sessions.

662
00:46:19,707 --> 00:46:21,165
Whatever.

663
00:46:30,676 --> 00:46:33,511
l'm not sure when he started,
but my sense is not too long ago.

664
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:35,927
l'm hoping we can nip this
in the bud.

665
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,057
Well, l'll have the officers on duty
monitor Beecher carefully

666
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:40,846
and l'll see
who he's hanging out with.

667
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,345
Well, it can't be Schillinger
who's supplying.

668
00:46:43,564 --> 00:46:47,478
He's so anti-drug, he makes me
look like Robert Downey Jr.

669
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:50,439
Yeah, maybe we should
also talk to members of his family.

670
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:52,481
Well, his wife took the kids
and moved away,

671
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:55,189
but he does have parents
and siblings.

672
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:58,327
- What about an intervention?
- l think that's too much, too soon.

673
00:46:58,537 --> 00:47:01,574
Why don't we invite one of his relatives
to visit him and see what happens?

674
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,418
You know, on the outside, Beecher
had a history of alcohol abuse.

675
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:06,459
Oh, l know. How pathetic is that?

676
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,165
The man gets jailed
for one addiction

677
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,085
and we watch him
get hooked on another.

678
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:37,238
You smell good, Mother.

679
00:47:37,618 --> 00:47:39,196
Same old Chanel, l'm afraid.

680
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:41,618
Yeah, l remember you and Dad
getting ready to go out,

681
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:45,537
him putting on his tux,
you wearing the latest gown,

682
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:48,871
and that scent
wafting through the air.

683
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:54,458
But that was a long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away.

684
00:47:56,303 --> 00:47:58,011
Toby...

685
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:02,971
...l had a conversation

686
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:05,676
with the man who runs...

687
00:48:06,438 --> 00:48:09,807
- ...the place where you live.
- McManus?

688
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:15,029
He told me that he suspects you
of using drugs.

689
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:20,156
- Mother--
- Heroin.

690
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,415
Mother, you don't know
what it's like in here.

691
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:28,751
- l can imagine.
- No, you can't!

692
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:33,373
And l thank God every night for that.

693
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:38,427
So if you wanna tell me about
how Angus is doing in law school

694
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:42,137
or about Dad's
most recent fishing trip

695
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:45,635
or Grandmother's lumbago, fine.

696
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:49,011
But if you came here to lecture me,

697
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:51,983
tell me to ''just say no''...

698
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:56,321
...don't.

699
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:01,527
Don't put that final knife in my heart.

700
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:04,660
Toby.

701
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:22,087
Get out!

702
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:50,165
Hello, Tobias. Come on in. Sit down.

703
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:53,460
Okay, we've got a new member
to our group, Tobias Beecher.

704
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:57,715
Tobias, l think you know
Augustus and Ron from Em City,

705
00:49:57,925 --> 00:50:04,213
and that's John and Bill
and Whitney Munson.

706
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:06,223
Beecher. l knew a Beecher.

707
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:09,642
- Cyrus. Are you any relation?
- No.

708
00:50:09,854 --> 00:50:11,893
Good. The man was a cocksucker.

709
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,893
Okay, the idea here

710
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:18,478
is for us, in this small group,
to talk about ourselves,

711
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:23,025
our feelings, our addictions,
in the hope that we can find the cause.

712
00:50:23,242 --> 00:50:25,116
l know the cause.

713
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:28,162
- l like the shit.
- All right, that's fine.

714
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:31,373
Pleasure plays a very strong factor.

715
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:33,410
But underneath,
maybe there's something else.

716
00:50:33,627 --> 00:50:37,672
There's a deeper need,
a deeper hunger,

717
00:50:37,882 --> 00:50:42,259
an emptiness that has to be filled.

718
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,381
So, Tobias, why don't you tell us
what you're addicted to?

719
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:49,970
You know.

720
00:50:50,186 --> 00:50:51,514
They know.

721
00:50:52,563 --> 00:50:56,691
Yeah, okay. Augustus,
you wanna talk about your addiction?

722
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:58,977
l was a crack addict.

723
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:01,152
Been squeaky clean 22 months.

724
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:04,904
- Yes. Ron?
- Speed's my fave.

725
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:08,451
- How long you been clean?
- A year.

726
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:11,657
Whitney.

727
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:15,243
l quit seven times
over the last 52 years,

728
00:51:15,461 --> 00:51:20,538
this being my longest period:
five years, three months and six days.

729
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,128
What are you addicted to?

730
00:51:22,343 --> 00:51:23,967
- What, since l been inside?
- Yeah.

731
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:28,092
Anything l can get my hands on,
but originally opium.

732
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:41,401
l had been decorated
with the Purple Heart for valour.

733
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:43,521
Valour.

734
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,190
Only l knew l was really a fraud.

735
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:51,155
Even after l was discharged,
l couldn't take the uniform off.

736
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,827
During the war,
while l was in the Orient,

737
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,242
l got hooked into opium.

738
00:51:57,461 --> 00:52:01,245
My true self
lay in that quixotic little drug.

739
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,603
Prisoner number 45M242,
Whitney Munson.

740
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:20,270
Convicted March 7th, '45.

741
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:21,765
Murder in the first degree,

742
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,937
criminal possession
of a controlled substance.

743
00:52:24,113 --> 00:52:26,818
Sentence: 1 1 0 years.

744
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:29,826
Up for parole in 60.

745
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:32,491
Question:
why'd you strangle the whore?

746
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:36,162
l didn't think l was.
l thought l was being affectionate.

747
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:39,993
Her neck was so pale,

748
00:52:40,212 --> 00:52:43,297
so thin, so fine.

749
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,087
And you've been in prison
for 52 years, right?

750
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:51,306
That's right. l only got eight years left
until my parole.

751
00:52:51,474 --> 00:52:54,925
Come the year 2005,
l'm out of here.

752
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:58,560
l can't stay here anymore and listen
to any more of these fucking stories!

753
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,807
- Tobias, sit down.
- No, it's not helping.

754
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:02,643
- Sit down.
- lt's not helping!

755
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:04,855
Hold it!

756
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:21,458
- Hello.
- Yeah, yeah.

757
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:25,163
l'm here to give you a makeover.

758
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:29,546
Your boyfriend told me to.

759
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,641
He said,
''Don't take no for an answer.''

760
00:53:58,457 --> 00:54:00,366
My God.

761
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,203
You're even prettier
than l thought you'd be.

762
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:27,110
He really is a beautiful baby.

763
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:40,372
Miguel.

764
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,327
Your baby is dead.

765
00:54:58,225 --> 00:54:59,850
l ain't saying drugs are good.

766
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,311
But when your past is past
and your present sucks,

767
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:07,900
your future holds nothing
but broken promises and dead dreams,

768
00:55:08,068 --> 00:55:09,693
the drugs, they kill the pain.

769
00:55:09,904 --> 00:55:13,652
Listen up, America.
You ain't never gonna get rid of drugs

770
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:17,525
until you cure pain.
