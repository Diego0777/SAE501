1
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:44,236
So there used to be this tribe,
the Aztecs,

2
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:47,717
who believed that the universe
was created by violence.

3
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:50,037
Every year,
at what was their version of Christmas,

4
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:53,517
they would cut out someone's heart
and offer it up to the gods.

5
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:56,121
These people were convinced
that without this sacrifice,

6
00:01:56,287 --> 00:02:00,439
the sun would fall from the sky
and the world would come to an end.

7
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,997
Then the Spaniards landed and wiped
the Aztecs off the face of the earth.

8
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,759
Turns out they was right.

9
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,838
The world did come to an end.

10
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,838
For them.

11
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,683
Welcome to Oz.

12
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:15,407
Ten months after the world ended.

13
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,599
All right.

14
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,725
A lot of people thought
we'd never reopen Emerald City,

15
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:45,677
but after almost a year,
a lot of politicking, ball-busting

16
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:48,680
and some backup from the warden,
here we are.

17
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,236
- lt's a new deal, gentlemen.
- lt's a better deal.

18
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:55,923
lt's a fair deal.
Now, l have identified ten groups.

19
00:02:56,087 --> 00:03:01,002
The Muslims, the Gangsters,
the Latinos, the ltalians, the lrish,

20
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:06,400
the Aryans, the Bikers, the Christians,
the Gays, and one called the Others.

21
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:11,200
Each group will have four prisoners
living at Em City, no more, no less.

22
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,244
Each group will be equal.

23
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,240
- Each individual, equal.
- Bullshit.

24
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,886
No, it is not bullshit.

25
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:21,483
And to make sure that it's not,
l'm also establishing a council

26
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:24,400
to air grievances, to advise me.

27
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:28,480
Each group will have one member
serve on said council.

28
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:29,921
- Any questions?
- Yes.

29
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:34,205
Given all that's happened,
why did you come back?

30
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,961
Why do you still believe
Emerald City will work?

31
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,845
Well, the truth is this:

32
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,238
We either learn to change
or we repeat our mistakes.

33
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,398
We either become a part
of our community,

34
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,319
or we remain isolated from it.

35
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:50,446
ln either case, the success
of our lives depends on us.

36
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:54,284
l am not solely responsible
to make Em City work.

37
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,199
lt's you too.

38
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,918
Any other questions?

39
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:06,246
Kareem, you should be
our representative on the council.

40
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:09,205
- That's assuming that we participate.
- Are you saying we shouldn't?

41
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,005
No, l'm saying that we wait.

42
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,125
Our absence may speak louder
than our presence.

43
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,801
First thing, we start to sell tits again.

44
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:20,880
- Yeah, but what about O'Reily?
- l'll handle O'Reily.

45
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,125
l'll handle Adebisi.

46
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:25,801
What worries me
is the Sicilians coming in.

47
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:29,004
- l don't see Nino Schibetta anywhere.
- Schibetta's dead.

48
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,965
lt's his son who's the hair
across our ass now.

49
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,004
We're gonna take back
the drug trade,

50
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,523
find out who hurt my father,
and then...

51
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:41,244
Shit. The rest of these
cock motherfuckers,

52
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,717
they gonna learn, bro.
They can't shit on us no more.

53
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,400
How the fuck
did l get to be an Other?

54
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,841
On the streets, l was selling dope.

55
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,440
l was as bad
as any of those Homeboys.

56
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,086
l fucking killed a cop!

57
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:54,398
- l'm thrown in here with you guys.
- You're disabled.

58
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,285
And the rest of you
are fucking certifiable.

59
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:58,596
Who are you?

60
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:02,643
Agamemnon Busmalis,
a.k.a. The Mole.

61
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,763
- The Mole?
- l dig.

62
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:08,920
l can dig anywhere.
l'm gonna dig my way out of Oz.

63
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,647
l tell you, l don't belong
with those three clowns, man.

64
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,843
They're crazy. Especially Beecher.

65
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,918
l mean, forget all that shit
he did to Schillinger.

66
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,123
Beecher bit off
some fucker's dick, yo.

67
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,881
That was ten months ago.

68
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:23,083
Oh, yeah, well, then that's okay.

69
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:26,000
l gotta share a pod, McManus.
l gotta sleep with one eye open.

70
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,442
Sister Peter Marie says
he's responding to therapy.

71
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:30,325
Well, then let her bunk with him.

72
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,318
All right, l call this first meeting
of the Emerald City Council to order.

73
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,284
We're gonna need
a recording secretary.

74
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:25,678
- Anyone know how to write?
- l'll do it.

75
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:29,157
- l'm famous for my penmanship.
- Here you go, watch out.

76
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:34,719
Now, a lot of you men
have had raw deals growing up.

77
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:39,244
Abusive parents,
shitty housing, no jobs.

78
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,682
Now, my goal is to make clear
that each of you

79
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:44,725
has an equal opportunity
to turn your lives around.

80
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,685
Oh, yeah?
And how you gonna do that?

81
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,917
lnitially, with education.

82
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:52,885
Over half the inmates in Oz
never finished high school.

83
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,766
The Federal prison system
has mandatory education programs

84
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,485
in place since 1 982.

85
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,683
We're gonna have the same
requirements in Emerald City.

86
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:01,803
- There's already a program.
- lt's not mandatory.

87
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:02,922
Yo, who cares, man?

88
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,965
What's important is
we start bringing back them conjugals.

89
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,920
How about
some fucking cigarettes, huh?

90
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,722
One thing at a time, guys.
One thing at a time.

91
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:14,400
Education first.

92
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,876
Since it's mandatory,
we're gonna have more students.

93
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:19,436
Therefore,
we're gonna need more teachers.

94
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:24,362
And since our budget for this thing
is so small, l'm asking for volunteers.

95
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,119
- O'Reily.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,357
Coushaine, l saw in your files

97
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,325
- you used to teach high school briefly.
- Yeah.

98
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:34,524
- How about helping us out here?
- Okay.

99
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,325
- Nice one, buddy boy.
- What a trouper.

100
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:37,442
Okay, okay.

101
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:43,279
Said, the Muslims weren't represented
at the council meeting.

102
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,756
lf this council has real power,

103
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,885
- then we will participate.
- Well, how do you mean?

104
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:52,357
Do we get to make policy
or do we simply rubber-stamp yours?

105
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:55,837
- This is a prison, not a democracy.
- Oh, l know that only too well.

106
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:58,919
You know, l meant what l said
about a second chance.

107
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:00,236
l wanna do it right this time.

108
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,126
lf you don't wanna participate,
that's fine. Just don't get in my way.

109
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:06,644
McManus, you want us to be allies,

110
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,845
but that will never happen.

111
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:12,795
Better for you to transfer me back
to Gen Pop and be done with me.

112
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,126
No.

113
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,603
You know, when l was laying
in that hospital bed

114
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,998
and l was afraid l was gonna die,
l started praying.

115
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,965
l'm not saying l had
any great spiritual awakening, Said,

116
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:32,086
but l did come to realize that my God
and yours aren't so different.

117
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,965
They both expect the best from us,

118
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,561
and for us to find the best
in each other.

119
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,118
l've written another book, McManus.

120
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,437
Comes out next month,
it's about the riot.

121
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,167
And when l was writing,
l looked for the best in you.

122
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:50,479
You wanna know what l found?
A confused, frightened little man.

123
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,241
Well, l was frightened
and l was confused.

124
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,797
But you take a bullet in the chest,
you see things differently.

125
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,958
People can change, Said.

126
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,765
Even me.

127
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,800
Even you.

128
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,122
Kenny.

129
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,039
McManus, you're fucking up my floor,
McManus.

130
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,435
- That's all right.
- My dick.

131
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,086
You don't have to mop it up again.

132
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,124
You went to class
when you first got to Oz,

133
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,005
but then you dropped out.

134
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:27,279
- l hated that shit.
- So you prefer mopping floors?

135
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:30,996
l prefer to be chilling with some chicks
and some Henny, but l can't, can l?

136
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,839
What about when you get out?

137
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,725
How you gonna get a job
without an education?

138
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,357
- l got a job when l get out.
- Yeah, what?

139
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,724
l made some connections in here.
People are gonna take care of me.

140
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,559
l see.
You're gonna be selling drugs?

141
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,242
- What do you want, McManus?
- A trade.

142
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:48,365
- lnstead of this, you get your GED.
- What?

143
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,006
You finish high school.

144
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:54,805
lt's a simple offer.
Class instead of work, your choice.

145
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,446
And l won't have to mop no more?

146
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,682
All right, l'll look into it.

147
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,285
- Hey.
- Hey.

148
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,324
What you working on there?

149
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,239
l'm working on a poem.

150
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:21,040
- That's a poem?
- Yeah, it ain't finished yet, though.

151
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,960
- Got any words for it?
- Up here.

152
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:27,041
- You never write them down?
- lt's easier like this.

153
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,925
Why don't you read it to me?

154
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:34,875
l gotta keep away from these motels.

155
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:36,844
These cockroach motels.

156
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,521
But l ain't going out like that.
You see, us cockroaches,

157
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:42,406
We been around
Since the beginning of time.

158
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,239
Now l'm letting loose
On a little bit of crime.

159
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,398
Look, these motherfucking
Motel makers

160
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,239
They shook.
But l ain't getting caught.

161
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,716
l ain't from the silly sort
Who venture too far from the nest.

162
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:51,842
You can't touch some sand.

163
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,475
l gotta play the deep dog,
Lower level funk for a sec, though.

164
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,558
LEL shit
Get that mental in check.

165
00:10:56,727 --> 00:11:01,801
Prisoner number 96J332,
Arnold Jackson, a.k.a. Poet.

166
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,197
Convicted February 1 5th, '96.

167
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:08,116
Armed robbery, attempted murder,
possession of a deadly weapon.

168
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,482
Sentence: 1 6 years.

169
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:12,717
Up for parole in nine.

170
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:16,562
Listen, l want you
to start coming to class.

171
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,797
l ain't with that, man. That's not me.

172
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:22,004
l want you to get your education,
l want you to get a diploma.

173
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,486
Fuck that.

174
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,239
- Man.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait.

175
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:26,840
- l'll tell you what.
- What?

176
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,043
You start going to class,

177
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:31,004
l'll arrange for you
to have a conjugal visit.

178
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,840
- l ain't even married, man.
- Got a girlfriend?

179
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,759
- Yeah.
- Well, like l said,

180
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,919
you start going to class, you keep
going to class, you get your GED,

181
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:41,760
l'll arrange for you to see her once.

182
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,765
Ain't there rules about this, man?

183
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:49,839
Fuck the rules.

184
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,281
Deal?

185
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:57,601
All right.

186
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,516
Today, we're gonna concentrate
on reading and grammar

187
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,155
so l can get a sense
of everyone's skill level.

188
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,320
Let's start with having somebody
read out loud.

189
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:13,442
Anybody?

190
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:16,841
Kenny, right? Yes.

191
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,726
Open to page one
and read the first paragraph.

192
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:22,355
- What do l need to read this shit for?
- We're all gonna listen,

193
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,279
and if there's a word
we don't understand,

194
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,802
- we're gonna make a vocabulary list.
- A what?

195
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,844
See, there's our first one:
vocabulary.

196
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:32,158
How many people here know
what the word ''vocabulary'' means?

197
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:35,444
- Ain't that a disease?
- Okay, vocabulary.

198
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,127
- Vocab--
- Hey, you got that, don't you?

199
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:40,925
A limp vocabulary?

200
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,123
Fuck you. You ain't even got one.

201
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:46,599
--bulary.

202
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,838
Now, a vocabulary
is any list of words.

203
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:54,239
And now, the word ''vocabulary''
can be added to our vocabulary list.

204
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,763
Let's get started. Kenny?

205
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:00,237
- Let this mick fuck right here read it.
- He'll get a chance. You go first.

206
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:01,965
l said no, man.

207
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,560
Just open the page. Read page one.

208
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:04,876
- No big deal.
- You fucking deaf?

209
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,321
l said l ain't reading.

210
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,717
- l'm just asking you to open--
- You fuck--!

211
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:10,002
Yeah!

212
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,284
Lockdown! Lockdown!

213
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,520
What happened?

214
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,086
- He tried to strangle me.
- Kenny?

215
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:45,158
- That bitch got in my face!
- l wasn't in your face!

216
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:46,601
- Do you need a doctor?
- l'm okay.

217
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,723
- How did this happen?
- l asked him to read out loud,

218
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,718
- next thing, he's trying to kill me.
- Fuck you!

219
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,525
- Shut up, Kenny!
- That's what happened.

220
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,120
Take him to my office.

221
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:00,365
- Why did you do it?
- Look, l told you.

222
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,324
- He got in my face, all right?
- That's bullshit!

223
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,684
We made a deal, and part of the deal
was you do what the teacher tells you.

224
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,360
Look, l'm nobody's prag, McManus.

225
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,563
- Nobody's.
- Fine.

226
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,080
- Read.
- No.

227
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,317
Read. Read it.

228
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,836
What does that say?

229
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,686
Look at it.

230
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,201
What does it say?

231
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,041
McDonald's.

232
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,320
Officer.

233
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,921
Take him back to his cell, please.

234
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:03,444
- l want Wangler in the hole.
- lt's not that Wangler wouldn't read,

235
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,804
he couldn't read.
Leo, the kid can't fucking read at all.

236
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,286
So that excuses his behaviour?

237
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,403
No, it gives us insight
how to help him.

238
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,478
- And you're gonna teach him to read?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,399
A hundred and fifty years ago,

240
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:19,035
it was against the law
to teach a slave to read.

241
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,562
But some did
because they had a thirst for it.

242
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:26,403
Well, now, the reverse is also true.
You cannot force someone to learn.

243
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,159
l can try.

244
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,963
Them Aztecs, they had this king,
Montezuma ll.

245
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:48,402
That's the Halls of Montezuma guy.

246
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:51,479
One night, Montezuma
saw this flaming ear of corn

247
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:53,877
shoot across the sky.

248
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,885
A comet.

249
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,720
Montezuma saw this comet
as an omen,

250
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,559
a sign of his own downfall.

251
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,037
And so he surrendered his empire
to the Spanish conquistadors

252
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,401
without a fight.

253
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,080
Have a seat.

254
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:10,640
Stupid fuck.

255
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:14,163
You gotta fight,
even if you know you're gonna lose.

256
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,644
You know what this is called?
''Learning to Read.''

257
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,640
Oh, man.

258
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,763
Lesson one.

259
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,639
A.

260
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:40,242
- That is definitely rat shit.
- One big fucking rat. Smell it.

261
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,716
Get that away from me.

262
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,321
Well, we gotta kill this motherfucker.

263
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,160
- With some traps or something.
- You can't kill rats.

264
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:51,717
Rats and cockroaches,
they'll inherit the whole fucking planet.

265
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,359
Whoa, what's the fucking hold-up?

266
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,755
Easy, easy, we're coming.

267
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,725
Which one of you moolies
is the cook back there?

268
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:02,565
Hey, l ain't no moolie, pal.
What's your fucking problem?

269
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,366
- Problem is, the food sucks.
- Don't eat it.

270
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:07,479
Things are gonna
start to change around here.

271
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,205
Oh, yeah, who says?

272
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,517
- Peter Schibetta.
- Who Schibetta?

273
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:13,040
- l'm talking to the mick.
- Mick?

274
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,756
- Peter wants the kitchen back.
- Tell him okay if he sucks my dick.

275
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:20,636
You ain't careful,
you might not have a dick to suck.

276
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,360
You think they know about Nino?

277
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,724
- That we killed him?
- Who gives a fuck?

278
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:32,560
l took care of Nino,
l'll take care of them.

279
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,847
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

280
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:44,680
- Where you going?
- l need to talk to you about your father.

281
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:51,520
What do you know about my father?

282
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,723
l know how he died.
l know who killed him.

283
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,002
- Who?
- Adebisi.

284
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:58,557
- Who?
- Adebisi, the moolie in the kitchen.

285
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,002
He was putting ground glass
in Nino's food every day.

286
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,122
That's how he died.

287
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,482
- How do you know that?
- l saw him grinding up the glass.

288
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,844
And when he wasn't looking,
l put the same glass in his food.

289
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,358
- Hold him.
- No.

290
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,400
Fuck off!

291
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:14,636
- Did you kill my father?
- No!

292
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:16,718
- That's what you're telling me!
- Adebisi killed him.

293
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,081
l was trying to kill Adebisi.

294
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,203
- Why?
- He's totally out of control.

295
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,325
He stores up most of the tits
that we bring into this place.

296
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,045
l helped your father
when he was alive.

297
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,765
l figured you and me
could do the same.

298
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:30,999
Let him go.

299
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:36,560
lf that fucking mulignane
killed my father, l'll take care of him.

300
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,203
Now excuse me,
l'm in the middle of a workout.

301
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,442
Well, just so you know,
l'm here for you.

302
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,120
Yeah, l heard you the first time.

303
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,759
You believe him?

304
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:59,119
All rats know
when to desert a sinking ship.

305
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,440
He's a smart one,
but a rat just the same.

306
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:04,445
Keep an eye on him.

307
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:09,836
Prisoner number 98S 1 1 2,
Peter Schibetta.

308
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,200
Convicted May 19th, '98.

00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:19,678

00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:22,239
Sentence: 35 years.

311
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,959
Up for parole in 20.

312
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:32,720
lt's open.

313
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,645
- Thank you, officer.
- You want me in or out?

314
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,366
Out, please.

315
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:47,205
Sit there.

316
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,397
You're a tough man to reach
all of a sudden.

317
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,762
- What does that mean?
- l'm here three weeks,

318
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,883
and this is the first time
you'd see me.

319
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,277
- What do you want?
- A return favour.

320
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:02,245
- What kind of favour?
- l want the kitchen.

321
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,477
Me and my guys
will run it from now on.

322
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:07,366
- Why?
- Because l'm asking.

323
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:09,836
- That's how it works between us now.
- No.

324
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,965
The way it works
is you're in my prison.

325
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:15,516
l don't take orders from you.
You take them from me.

326
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:21,325
This doesn't have to be complicated.
All l have to do is make one phone call.

327
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,360
l know.

328
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,442
Your father,
he was a respectable man.

329
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:34,236
We got along, and he never
would have pulled this shit with me.

330
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:40,798
My father lived by a code
that doesn't exist anymore.

331
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,197
A code that got him killed.

332
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,484
l do things my way
and l'm asking for a favour

333
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,445
in return for a favour you owe me.

334
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,480
So, what's it gonna be?

335
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:55,760
All right.

336
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,280
You can have the kitchen.

337
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,281
- Thank you, Leo.
- Warden Glynn.

338
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:01,722
We're done here.

339
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,957
Officer Armstrong.

340
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:11,765
Where do l find a knife?

341
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,758
Adebisi.

342
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:16,079
Adebisi.

343
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,681
Hey, Adebisi.

344
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,115
Peter Schibetta will be running
the kitchen from now on.

345
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:23,766
Schibetta?

346
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:27,155
Why are you giving that guinea
my job?

347
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,239
- Because l can.
- All right.

348
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,636
Well, you tell that guinea fuck
something from me, then.

349
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,717
We got rats.

350
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,719
l'm gonna start unwrapping
the bandages now.

351
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,682
Dr. Richards thinks
that the surgery was successful.

352
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:56,159
You'll have a scar, but your sight
should be nearly fully restored.

353
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:58,836
Okay.

354
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,284
Tell me if l hurt you.

355
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,316
Okay, open your eye.

356
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:13,046
- Can you see?
- Yes.

357
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:17,766
Good.

358
00:22:57,647 --> 00:23:01,196
- Let's go get a martini.
- What?

359
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,196
You know, when l was a lawyer,

360
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,835
after a long day
of trials and tribulations,

361
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:09,522
we'd all head over
to McSwaggins' for a vodka martini.

362
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,076
Dry, one olive.

363
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,761
Man, that would taste
so good right now.

364
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,395
Too many martinis is what
landed you here in the first place.

365
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,675
Hi. Do you have Schillinger's
psych profile ready yet?

366
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:22,644
Tim and l have to review it
before parole hearing.

367
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,081
l'm not finished yet.

368
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,965
- Another day okay?
- Sure.

369
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:29,437
Tobias, pull up Schillinger's file.
l'm going to the ladies' room.

370
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:34,999
She leaves you in here alone?

371
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,158
Why?
What do you think l'm gonna do?

372
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:40,319
Start a riot? Take hostages?

373
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,399
Listen, you're not making
any fucking sense.

374
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,035
- What the hell is going on?
- l threw them both out.

375
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:54,085
Those fucking boys of yours
are fucking out of control.

376
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,715
Drugs all the time and they're stealing
from me to pay for them.

377
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,606
- Where are they?
- Who knows and who the fuck cares?

378
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:01,962
You listen to me,
you stupid old bastard, you find them.

379
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:04,925
- You find my sons.
- And then what?

380
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:07,442
Bring them to Oz
for a little heart-to-heart?

381
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,086
Hey, don't you walk away,
you cocksucker!

382
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:10,602
Come on, Dad.

383
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,645
- Get the fuck back here, Dad!
- Party's over. Knock it off.

384
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:15,684
- God! Goddamn it, Dad!
- l said, knock it off!

385
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:17,565
You find my boys!

386
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,958
Well, Vern, baby.

387
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,957
Oh, l knew
that was gonna leave a fucking mark.

388
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:30,882
What you reading? Mein Kampf?
Let me tell you how it ends.

389
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:35,279
The Aryans get their ass kicked.
l've been doing some reading myself.

390
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,039
Your psychiatric profile.

391
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:38,720
According to Sister Peter Marie,

392
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:43,365
you have demonstrated
a genuine personality adjustment.

393
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:46,439
Bullshit. You're faking it
so you can make parole.

394
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,563
l'm gonna see to it
that you never leave Oz.

395
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:51,799
You hear me, sweet pea?
Never, ever.

396
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,359
Fill her up.

397
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,076
- l need an ask.
- What kind of ask?

398
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:11,876
Kill Beecher.

399
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:18,877
The motherfucker's crazy.
Wasting him, that's a pretty big favour.

400
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:20,275
All right, forget favour.

401
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:22,642
Job, l'll pay.

402
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:24,160
No way.

403
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,597
- Mark, how about you?
- No way, man.

404
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:29,836
Anybody?

405
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:37,878
- Pussies.
- Fuck you.

406
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:40,402
Yeah, you kill him.

407
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:42,843
l wish to Christ l could.

408
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:55,282
Hey. You guys doing business?

409
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:59,436
- Depends on what kind of business.
- l need somebody to kill Beecher.

410
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:03,926
Plenty of mooks around here
who will whack that nut.

411
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,006
- You?
- l'm no mook, pal.

412
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,566
Why don't you try the Latinos?

413
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,481
l thought you had no use
for us Latinos?

414
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:17,524
Will you whack Beecher or not?

415
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,086
Depends on what we get in return.

416
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:20,726
All right, l work the mailroom, right.

417
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:24,516
l can push whatever you need,
in or out, through the system.

418
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:27,565
- Tits?
- Sure.

419
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:28,796
l thought you were anti-drugs.

420
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,559
l don't care if you smuggle in
fucking tacos.

421
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,843
l want Beecher dead. Today.

422
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:34,679
What else? What else you got?

423
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,246
What the fuck do you mean,
what else?

424
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:39,558
No, mailbox shit is nice,
but l want more.

425
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:41,524
- More?
- Everything. Everything you got, man.

426
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,917
Goddamn it,
you fucking spic cocksucker.

427
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,282
See? That's the Schillinger
l know and love, baby.

428
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:47,880
Fuck you.

429
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,279
Get the fuck away from me.

430
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:35,163
You know the wonderful thing
about computers?

431
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:36,521
They don't know right from wrong.

432
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,518
You push a button,
they do what you tell them to do.

433
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,997
- People aren't like that.
- Get away from me.

434
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,362
Believe it or not,
l think you're gonna wanna hear this.

435
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:45,721
Working in the psych office,

436
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,038
l have access to all the files
from the whole prison.

437
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,757
l can change those files
to read any which way.

438
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:54,839
l can take away infractions,
or add them.

439
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,316
Like in your file,
the one the parole board's gonna see.

440
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,603
- Get the fuck away from me!
- What's the problem?

441
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,359
Him! He's the goddamn problem!

442
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:05,076
Then why are you the one yelling?
Take a walk.

443
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:18,039
- He's a bug, Wittlesey.
- You're all fucking bugs.

444
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,767
- Yeah, what about you?
- What are you talking about?

445
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:27,280
Like l said, l saw everything.
l saw you shoot Scott Ross.

446
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,359
Keep moving.

447
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,916
l know about your kid too,
and your mom being sick.

448
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,918
You could use
some extra cash, right?

449
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,000
Keep fucking moving.

450
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:38,637
You do Beecher like you did Ross,
l'll pay you.

451
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:42,163
- You'll pay me to kill Beecher?
- Two thousand dollars.

452
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,958
My parole hearing's tomorrow.
lf l get out, what l know goes with me.

453
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:47,606
l would need the money up front.

454
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,519
l can make a call
and wire it to your account.

455
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:54,158
Okay, soon as l get verification,
Beecher's dead.

456
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:59,441
When the Aztecs first saw
the Spaniards on horseback,

457
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,201
they thought the man and the horse
were one creature,

458
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:07,282
and the Aztecs knelt down
and worshipped this creature as God.

459
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:13,086
Sometimes, what you see
is not what is.

460
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:31,356
Hey, did you see that shit last night
between Wittlesey and Beecher?

461
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:34,758
- They're probably fucking.
- She didn't look too romantic to me.

462
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,565
Wittlesey was helping
Beecher escape.

463
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:38,080
He paid her to get him get out of Oz.

464
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:40,966
- They're fucking.
- No, l just heard they been fucking.

465
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:44,437
But Beecher was gonna tell someone,
so Wittlesey tried to kill his ass.

466
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:45,676
Say what to who?

467
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:48,566
That they'd been fucking.
He was gonna tell everyone.

468
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:49,716
- So, what?
- So?

469
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:52,640
So she banging
half the COs in this place.

470
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,526
Beecher opens his mouth,
that piss off the COs,

471
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,996
so she grabs Beecher, pop, pop.

472
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,044
l ain't seen him this morning.
That's for sure.

473
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:03,597
- That's because he escaped.
- l'll tell you, he's dead.

474
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:07,442
Who gives a fuck?
Come on, let's go.

475
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:13,800
So last night?

476
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:17,366
- You wanted Beecher dead, right?
- Yeah, l wanted him dead.

477
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:18,960
You paid me, right? Two grand?

478
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,446
Yeah.

479
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,998
You wanna see the body?

480
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,603
Shit. Sure.

481
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,280
All right.

482
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,606
lt's in here.

483
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,036
What the fuck?

484
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:51,323
- Nice try, Vern baby.
- Beecher.

485
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:55,643
You got anything to say?

486
00:31:57,127 --> 00:32:00,437
About what?
l don't know what you're talking about.

487
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,839
- You wanted Beecher dead, right?
- Yeah, l wanted him dead.

488
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,486
You can forget about
your parole hearing.

489
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:08,399
lnstead, get yourself a good lawyer.

490
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,876
We're charging you
with conspiracy to commit murder.

491
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:13,845
This is bullshit. l'm being set up.

492
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:15,520
Take him to the hole.

493
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:26,639
And a merry sing-song
Happy let us be

494
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:28,445
Merry was myself
And merry l could sing

495
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,245
With a merry ding-dong
Happy, gay and free

496
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,001
And a merry sing-song
Happy let us be

497
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:37,763
- What are you so cheerful about?
- Hill, you think l'm insane, right?

498
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,646
- Shit, yeah.
- Well, maybe l am.

499
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:43,275
But every once in a while,
the lawyer in me still pops out.

500
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:46,405
- Yeah?
- l wanted Schillinger away from me.

501
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,922
Out of Em City, but not free.

502
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,317
l had to figure out a way
to get his parole hearing cancelled.

503
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:53,523
l couldn't start a fight with him,
or l'd get in trouble.

504
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:56,565
So l manipulated him.

505
00:32:56,727 --> 00:33:00,925
l got him so psycho
that he tried to have me killed.

506
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:05,126
So now, not only
is Schillinger's parole chances dead,

507
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:07,717
but he's facing ten more years.

508
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,756
That's good, moyel.

509
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,635
And bad.

510
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,286
With no hope of leaving Oz,

511
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:18,166
now he's got even more reason
to fuck you up.

512
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:23,078
Yeah, well, thank God l'm crazy
because l don't give a shit.

513
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,477
Merry are the bells
And merry would they ring

514
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,717
And merry was my cell
And merry l would sing

515
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:30,162
With a merry ding-dong
l became free

516
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,399
And a merry sing-song
Happy let us be

517
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,235
- Hi.
- Hi.

518
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,557
- ls he in?
- With Father Mukada.

519
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,445
- For long?
- l don't think so.

520
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,723
Okay, l'll wait.

521
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:48,564
- So how do you like your new job?
- lt's fine.

522
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,525
- The warden's a very nice man.
- Yeah, he is.

523
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:54,804
l have to admit, the idea
of working in a prison terrified me,

524
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,446
but l've really gotten used to it.

525
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,006
Good.

526
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,959
Warden's office.

527
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:04,722
Sure. Hold on a moment.

528
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,727
Warden, your wife's on line three.

529
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,606
- Tell her l'll call her back.
- She says it's urgent.

530
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:12,803
- All right.
- Okay.

531
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,796
You know, l know what
you were saying about being afraid

532
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,039
because the first couple of weeks here
l was a nervous wreck.

533
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:22,198
- l think you're just being nice.
- No.

534
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,722
lt's very hard to imagine
you nervous about anything.

535
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,445
Believe me.

536
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,400
- Oh, Leo, good.
- l gotta go.

537
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,718
- l just wanna ask you one ques--
- l don't know when l'll be back.

538
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,716
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

539
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:40,685
Diane.

540
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,918
- Are you avoiding me?
- No.

541
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,555
Look, l want you to come back
and work at Em City.

542
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:49,002
- l'm happy where l am.
- Yeah, but l need you.

543
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,600
Oh, sure.

544
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:51,961
Diane.

545
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,601
The way that you handled
this thing on Schillinger...

546
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,439
Schillinger says
that you murdered Scott Ross.

547
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:04,565
You read the commission's report.
Ross was shot by the SORT team.

548
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,241
Yeah, but he says he's gonna tell
everybody that you shot Ross.

549
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:10,319
So? No one's gonna listen
to Schillinger, Tim.

550
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,796
Especially since
l turned him in on Beecher.

551
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,926
- Did you kill Ross?
- No.

552
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:19,885
What, are you gonna believe
that Nazi's word over mine?

553
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,604
Excuse me.
Warden Glynn just called.

554
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,086
He's not gonna make it back in time

555
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,203
and he'd like Sister Peter Marie
to run the meeting.

556
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:41,595
- Okay.
- Here's the agenda.

557
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,166
Sarah, did he say what happened?

558
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:46,319
Only that his daughter
is in the hospital.

559
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:53,119
Oh, well, what do you think
we should do?

560
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:57,360
Do what Leo wants. Let's get
the meeting started. Good morning.

561
00:35:57,527 --> 00:36:00,087
- Excuse me.
- ltem one...

562
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,165
- Yeah.
- Warden, it's time for you

563
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,124
to address the prisoners.

564
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,120
Okay.

565
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,482
All right, starting next month,

566
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,002
the librarian
will be available in the library

567
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,000

00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:32,762
Yeah, that's because the rest
of the time, she gonna be with me.

569
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,919
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

570
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:40,566
Bring him to my office.

00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:00,761
- Yeah?

572
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,565
Send him in.

00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:09,645
Thank you, officer.

574
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:37,681
Yo.

576
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:49,841
- Man, what the fuck is going on?
- You've been reassigned

577
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:53,317
- to work here in my office.
- Yeah, so, what you need me to do?

578
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,559
Go over to the door.

579
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,600
And?

580
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,606
Stand there.

581
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,564
What, you just want me
to stand here?

582
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:16,199
Until l need you to do something.

583
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:25,195
Yo, l got visiting hours at 4.

00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:29,202

Yeah, okay.

587
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:03,556
Really?

588
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,201
Warden?

589
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:01,566
- Yeah?

590
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,515
- Yeah.
- Well, l haven't done dick all day, man.

591
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,120
l've been standing here.

592
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,405
My mother and my sisters
are coming in ten minutes.

593
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:14,240
You're right.

594
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:15,886
You haven't done dick all day.

595
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:26,166
- Clean my bathroom.
- What?

596
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:29,603
Clean the bathroom.
The floor, the sink, scrub the toilet.

597
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,839
And when you're done,
when it's spotless,

598
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:34,281
go meet your family.

599
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:38,356
- Are you fucking with me?
- You're right, l'm fucking with you.

600
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:40,802
The mop and the bucket are in there.

601
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:02,325
Shit! Shit!

602
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:04,316
Fuck!

603
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,126
Caught you.

604
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:18,642
He said he was leaving it
right here, but l don't see it.

605
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:21,367
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

606
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:23,279
Hey, Miguel.

607
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,039
l know.

608
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:28,598
You and me, it's weird, huh?

609
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,926
l mean,
how we don't have much contact.

610
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:35,443
l'm always on one side of the door,
you're always on the other side.

611
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,124
But l see you.

612
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,562
l see you looking at me
when you open the door.

613
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,200
l'm not looking at you.

614
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,165
Come on, l see you looking at me
looking at you.

615
00:41:48,727 --> 00:41:50,797
l gotta tell you something,

616
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:53,158
and l know you know,

617
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,398
you're beautiful.

618
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:58,320
And you are flirting with me.

619
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:00,600
What, you gonna have me arrested?

620
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:09,520
- Sarah, where the hell is that file?
- l can't find it.

621
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:12,247
- She's been looking hard, man.
- Shut up!

622
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,318
You don't talk unless l speak to you.

623
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:16,478
And don't you ever, ever talk to her.

624
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,877
- Do you understand?
- What, talk to her?

625
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:20,799
l already fucked her.

626
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:24,519
The fuck up her!

627
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,803
Fuck you! Get the fuck off me!

628
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,800
Get the fuck off me!
You're fucking choking me!

629
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:33,999
You're fucking choking me!
You're choking me!

630
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,282
Get the fuck off!

631
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:37,005
Fuck you, fuck you!

632
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,885
- We got him, we got him.
- Wanna fuck with me?

633
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:40,639
- Wanna fuck with me?
- Take him to the hole!

634
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:43,321
You're a fucking pussy!
Don't fucking hit me!

635
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:45,842
Fuck, come with me. Fucking bitch.

636
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:49,518
Fuck you. Get the fuck off!

637
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:56,079
You're bleeding.

638
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,122
Ah, gymnasium.

639
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:30,280
The smell of testosterone,
the smell of sweat.

640
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:32,599
You have something
to say to me, just say it.

641
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,759
Well, Sarah's thinking about quitting

642
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:37,361
because of what happened today
between you and Alvarez.

643
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:39,563
Then she should quit.

644
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:42,640
Well, maybe so, maybe not,
but that's not the point.

645
00:43:42,807 --> 00:43:45,275
You know, Leo,
when somebody asks me

646
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:48,883
what's the real Leo Glynn like,
the first word that comes to mind:

647
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:53,086
Balanced.
The most balanced person l know.

648
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:54,965
And the second word:

649
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:56,321
Honest.

650
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:00,366
Listen.

651
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:04,559
l don't want you
to tell anybody about this.

652
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,445
You have my word.

653
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:11,126
My oldest daughter, Ardith,

654
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:14,285
she was walking to class.

655
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:16,722
She's a student, you know,
at the university.

656
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,001
They raped her.

657
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,398
Oh, my God.

658
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:24,285
She's in the hospital.

659
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,881
She's lying there
with her eyes open.

660
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:28,844
Some kind of shock.

661
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,922
She is just the sweetest person
on the planet, you know.

662
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,759
l mean, never a bad word
to say about anybody.

663
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:35,679
l know, l know.

664
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:37,884
So do they have any idea
who did this?

665
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:41,881
Witnesses say
they saw a gang of kids.

666
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,837
Latino kids.

667
00:44:46,327 --> 00:44:48,841
So some unknown
Latino kid hurts Ardith

668
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:50,884
and you lash out
at the first Latino you see?

669
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:52,560
- No, no.
- Leo.

670
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:56,925
Leo, Miguel Alvarez
did not rape your daughter.

671
00:44:57,847 --> 00:45:00,486
And whatever else he's done before,

672
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:05,755
you are too fine a man to punish him
for something he didn't do.

673
00:45:39,087 --> 00:45:40,566
You're going back to Em City.

674
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:49,359
- Does Glynn know about this?
- Yep.

675
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,404
What?
Did you convince him to let me out?

676
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:55,800
Nope.

677
00:45:57,687 --> 00:46:00,326
You know,
l haven't seen you since...

678
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:04,843
- Look, what happened with the riot--
- l don't wanna talk about it, Miguel.

679
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:06,326
Miguel. Miguel!

680
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:09,445
No! Miguel!

681
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:16,561
l've already forgiven you, all right?

682
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,925
l expect you'll do the same
for Warden Glynn.

683
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:43,762
Besides horses, the Aztecs
had never seen a cannon.

684
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:47,966
They had never seen such raw,
boom power thundering at them.

685
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:49,116
They was afraid.

686
00:46:49,287 --> 00:46:52,245
Between the cannons and the horses,
the fucking comet,

687
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:57,037
shit, that whirlwind turned
pretty fucking fast, son.

688
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:00,836
l don't know.

689
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:02,759
Come on, come on, come on.

690
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,485
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Yo.

691
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:15,639
- Did you spill coffee on yourself?
- What are you talking about?

692
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,835
Fuck.

693
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:38,959
Does that hurt?

694
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:42,076
Well?

695
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:44,805
Do it again.

696
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:48,482
This is a medical examination,
O'Reily, not foreplay.

697
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:50,046
Yeah, says you.

698
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:51,925
ls there any pain
when l touch your nipple?

699
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:53,156
No.

700
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:56,204
Has it swelled up or been sore?

701
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:59,803
A little, but l just figured it's because
l've been exercising a lot lately, yeah.

702
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:01,400
ln general,
your health has been good?

703
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:03,319
l'm alive, right?

704
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,479
All right. Well,
we'll have to run some blood tests.

705
00:48:06,647 --> 00:48:09,115
- Take some x-rays.
- What do you think it is?

706
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,040
Beats me. l'm gonna have to
crack open my medical books.

707
00:48:12,207 --> 00:48:13,799
l think we'll keep you
in the ward overnight.

708
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:17,357
No problem, just so long
as you come and tuck me in.

709
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:21,518
Suck out his blood.

710
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,121
Hi.

711
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:26,402
What's your name?

712
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:01,239
Blackjack. Read them and weep.

713
00:49:01,887 --> 00:49:03,400
Ryan.

714
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:05,846
Hold those.

715
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:07,042
Ryan?

716
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:09,675
You're calling me Ryan?
Can l call you Gloria?

717
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,644
l got your test results from the lab.

718
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:14,002
Oh, shit. Does that mean
l'm going back to Em City, huh?

719
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,806
- l was just starting to get comfortable.
- You're not leaving quite yet.

720
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,921
This lump under your left nipple,
it's a tumour.

721
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,962
l need to do
what we call an aspiration.

722
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:28,038
We draw a small amount of fluid
out of the nipple

723
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:29,526
and examine it under a microscope.

724
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,757
- To look for what?
- A carcinoma.

725
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,519
Ryan,

726
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:36,446
you may have breast cancer.

727
00:49:38,127 --> 00:49:39,276
That's funny.

728
00:49:40,087 --> 00:49:41,884
l'm not kidding.

729
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:44,320
Breast cancer?

730
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:49,001
- Girls get breast cancer.
- Men do too.

731
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,123
lt's rare, especially at your age,
but it does happen.

732
00:49:51,527 --> 00:49:53,836
- l'm not a fag, you know that?
- Ryan--

733
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:56,441
No, l've been in this shit hole
for over a year,

734
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:58,245
and l ain't ever taken it up the ass.

735
00:49:58,407 --> 00:49:59,760
No one is saying that you have.

736
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:02,487
Bullshit! You're telling me
l've got a chick's disease!

737
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:06,003
- Men have breasts, same as women.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

738
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:09,318
l don't got any breasts.
l got a chest. See it, huh?

739
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:10,806
- See it?
- Dr. Nathan?

740
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,481
lt's okay, it's okay.

741
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,960
You listen to me.

742
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,483
You go back inside
your medical books.

743
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,484
You suck out more of my blood.

744
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:27,045
You do what you gotta do,
but you get me another verdict.

745
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,357
You understand me?

746
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,325
Because l ain't got
any fucking breast cancer.

747
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,044
Fuck.

748
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,601
Well, you can't really blame him
for overreacting.

749
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:55,998
l mean, men with breast cancer?
Who's ever heard of it?

750
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,806
Gloria, are you absolutely positive
about the diagnosis?

751
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:00,400
Look, l'm a GP.

752
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:02,398
lt's not the kind of thing
l come across every day,

753
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:05,081
but l called a friend of mine
who's an oncologist,

754
00:51:05,247 --> 00:51:06,521
ran the specifics down.

755
00:51:06,687 --> 00:51:09,076
He said he'd be hard pressed
to figure out what else it indicates.

756
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:12,326
- So do the needle aspiration.
- O'Reily says no.

757
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,840
He's in denial.

758
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:15,998
Now, if he does have it,
he's gonna need all our help

759
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:18,158
to accept the reality
of what's happening to him.

760
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:19,555
To fight the disease.

761
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:22,161
l have a pretty good relationship
with him. l'll talk to him.

762
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:23,999
l think, you know, maybe l should.

763
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,397
Maybe he'll feel more comfortable
talking about it with a guy.

764
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,558
- Maybe he'll be embarrassed.
- Well, see him together.

765
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:31,321
No, then he'll think
that we're ganging up on him.

766
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,478
- Got the perfect solution here.
- What?

767
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:36,480
- Sister Pete, heads or tails?
- Heads.

768
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:44,526
Ryan.

769
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:50,285
All of a sudden everyone's
on a first-name basis with me?

770
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:54,123
Look, Dr. Nathan told me
about the cancer.

771
00:51:54,287 --> 00:51:57,199
Hey. For chrissakes, would you?

772
00:51:57,367 --> 00:52:00,006
l don't need every asshole in here
knowing about my business.

773
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,839
We can go into my office
if you want.

774
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:04,919
For what?
We got nothing to say to each other.

775
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:06,918
Nathan's got this whole thing
screwed up.

776
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:08,156
Maybe.

777
00:52:08,327 --> 00:52:09,840
But the only way
we're gonna know for sure

778
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:11,520
is if we do the biopsy.

779
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:16,884
Let's just say, for the sake
of argument, that she's right.

780
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,642
Then what, huh?

781
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:24,166
l go back into Em City,
those fucks find out.

782
00:52:24,327 --> 00:52:26,966
You know as well as l do,
any weakness,

783
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:30,642
any weakness at all, and l'm dead.

784
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,518
Look, if you do have...

785
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:37,677
lf you're sick
and you don't do anything about it,

786
00:52:37,847 --> 00:52:39,041
you're dead anyway.

787
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:40,196
Don't you see that?

788
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:41,880
lf this shit
spreads through your body,

789
00:52:42,047 --> 00:52:44,436
then everybody's
gonna know the truth.

790
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:48,636
And by then
it will be too late to save your life.

791
00:53:00,807 --> 00:53:02,559
l'm sorry.

792
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,525
Yeah.

793
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:19,240
So here's the funny part.

794
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:24,356
The Spaniards actually exterminated
the Aztecs by accident.

795
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,443
Yeah, they had the horses
and the cannons,

796
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,837
but they also brought over
smallpox.

797
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:33,880
lt was a disease
that finally finished the job.

798
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:38,006
A disease the Spanish gave the Aztecs
without even knowing.

799
00:53:45,527 --> 00:53:47,643
ln Oz, we do
what we can to survive.

800
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,367
But ultimately, it doesn't matter.

801
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,485
Life always gets in the way.
