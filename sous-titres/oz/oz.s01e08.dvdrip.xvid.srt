1
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,937
Remember when your high school
history teacher said that:

2
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:44,649
''The course of human events changes
because of the deeds of great men''?

3
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:46,909
Well, the bitch was lying.

4
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,738
Fuck Caesar, fuck Lincoln,
fuck Mahatma Gandhi.

5
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:54,330
The world keeps moving because
of you and me, the anonymous.

6
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:57,709
Revolutions get going
because there ain't enough bread.

7
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:01,372
Wars happen
over a game of checkers.

8
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:04,630
Hey.

9
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,300
Good night, turd.

10
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,905
Hey.

11
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:37,994
Go, move it.

12
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:53,851
Prisoner number 92S1 1 0,
Vernon Schillinger.

13
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,474
Convicted October 21 st, '92.

14
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,769
Aggravated assault
in the first degree.

15
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,565
Sentence: Eight years.

16
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:03,937
Up for parole in five.

17
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:07,900
l had a visit from my sons.

18
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,777
They're almost
out of their teens now.

19
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,739
Almost men.

20
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:17,575
They live with their grandfather.

21
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:21,660
The man who taught me
everything l know about hate.

22
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,957
Yesterday, my boys

23
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:29,000
sat there across from me,

24
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,714
ranting and raging.

25
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:36,638
They were both fucked up on drugs.

26
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,352
They know l hate drugs.

27
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,562
That l'm in here
because l hate drugs

28
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,901
and because l love them.

29
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:50,356
l yelled at them

30
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:53,443
and they just

31
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:55,286
laughed.

32
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:59,365
They laughed at me.

33
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,920
lt's funny, you know,

34
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:08,498
with one eye, l could see, finally,

35
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,005
that

36
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,800
they are becoming
the men l made them.

37
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:20,475
l got about three months
until l'm up for parole.

38
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,307
All l want is to get out of here.

39
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,775
Be there for them.

40
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,230
Try to help my kids.

41
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,986
That's all.

42
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,987
lf l let you back into Em City,
you'll kill Beecher.

43
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:43,955
lf l wanted him dead,
he'd already be dead.

44
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,290
You--

45
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,919
You say you've changed?
Why should l believe you?

46
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:54,510
Trust me, McManus,

47
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:58,347
you lose an eye,
you get kicked in the balls,

48
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,932
you get a face full of shit,

49
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,844
you become a different man.

50
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,025
King me.

51
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:15,198
- He's back.
- Hey.

52
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,899
Where's Beecher?

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,279
He's still in the hole.

54
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,382
Put these on.

55
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,175
Get up.

56
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:41,142
Do you wanna touch my dick?

57
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:43,180
Get dressed.

58
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,975
- l shit all over a man.
- l know.

59
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,609
- lt's not normal.
- No.

60
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,526
Get dressed.

61
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:57,244
Schillinger's back in Emerald City.

62
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:01,117
He says he won't harm you.
Tell me you won't harm him.

63
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,668
He burnt a swastika into my flesh,

64
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,747
he made me rip up
pictures of my family,

65
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,464
he made me eat
pages of a law book,

66
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,379
he made me wear women's makeup,
and he fucked me up the ass.

67
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,218
l know.

68
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:19,173
So now l just forgive him?

69
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:20,845
Yes.

70
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,220
Could you?

71
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,598
Yes.

72
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:34,480
All right.

73
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,358
l forgive him.

74
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,324
Hey, roomie.

75
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:50,412
So how crazy are you?

76
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,585
Crazy?

77
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,628
Well, you broke the glass,

78
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,423
you blinded Schillinger,

79
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:00,346
you took a shit on his face.

80
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:04,258
Hey. Hey, what the fuck
are you looking at?

81
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,106
You see, this is what l'm talking about.

82
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:14,068
The old Beecher
would've hid just now.

83
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,114
Yeah, well, l left
the old Beecher in the hole.

84
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,485
- l hear you.
- Hey.

85
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,907
Don't get so close to me, okay?

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,912
Okay.

87
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,666
Look,

88
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:31,332
any day,
the Muslims are gonna riot.

89
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:33,171
l may need you, crazy or not.

90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,294
Need me to do what?

91
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,420
Be my brother.

92
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,888
Hey. Hey.

93
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,013
lt's your move, asswipe.

94
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:51,140
Beecher. Watch it.

95
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:53,143
You're gonna have the fastest
turnaround time

96
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:54,812
in the history of the hole.

97
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,070
- Asswipe.
- l'll tell you, man,

98
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,776
you're gonna have to
take Beecher out,

99
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,322
otherwise you're not gonna have
any jizz left in Em City.

100
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,202
Everybody's gonna think
you're a pansy ass.

101
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,448
l don't care.

102
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,581
Let them.

103
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,369
When you're playing poker,

104
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:14,124
you can't let anybody at the table
know which cards you have,

105
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:16,705
what you're feeling,
what you're thinking.

106
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,339
You gotta develop a game face.

107
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:22,303
ln Oz,

108
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,965
we wear our game faces all day.

109
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:27,472
And into the night.

110
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:32,437
You wear your game face so much
that when you look in the mirror,

111
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,277
you're not sure which face
you're shaving.

112
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:40,186
- l bring them in, you sell them.
- A carton a day.

113
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,198
That's it.

114
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,794
What's going on?

115
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,841
There's a rumour that you're bringing
contraband into Emerald City.

116
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,730
- What?
- lt's bullshit, right?

117
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:14,773
- Who did you hear this from?
- Tell me it's not true.

118
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,355
- lt's not true.
- You're lying to me.

119
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:20,528
- No, l'm not lying.
- l have an eyewitness, Diane,

120
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:23,318
that saw you pass
cigarettes to Scott Ross.

121
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:24,950
An eye-fucking-witness.

122
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,450
- Who?
- Me.

123
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:33,417
- So l'm fired.
- No, you're not fired.

124
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:35,703
Look, l know that
you're worried about money.

125
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,168
l know you're worried about
your mother and Didi,

126
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,673
- but this shit has got to stop.
- Yeah. Okay.

127
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,423
- Okay, l'll put an end to it.
- Today.

128
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,262
Okay.

129
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:49,266
l appreciate
the second chance, Tim.

130
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,516
- l've been digging through your files.
- Yeah?

131
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,186
l know that Ross and your ex
were in the same biker gang.

132
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,680
Yeah.

133
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,360
You should have told me.

134
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,981
Yeah.

135
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:06,107
- Have you slept with Ross?
- What?

136
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:08,615
l'm just trying to figure out
if you fucked us both.

137
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,033
Wha--?

138
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,907
What is this?

139
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:14,330
You're trying to hurt me
for breaking up with you?

140
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:16,582
You're trying to prove
to me you've got a dick?

141
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,079
Oh, you know what,
l don't need this. l quit.

142
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:22,625
Oh, fuck! l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

143
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,169
- You're sorry?
- Yes.

144
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:28,222
l don't know
what's going on with me.

145
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,590
Forgive me, please.

146
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,427
Forgive you?

147
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:37,106
Okay. Okay, l forgive you.
l forgive you.

148
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:40,607
- You forgave me. We're even.
- Say you'll stay.

149
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:44,364
l got nowhere else to go.

150
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,589
Hey.

151
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,089
l'm done.
l'm out of the cigarette business.

152
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:08,342
Wait. What happened?

153
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,305
l just can't take the stress.

154
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,220
l don't wanna get caught. l'm done.

155
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:15,097
lt's not that easy.

156
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,687
What does that mean?

157
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,522
lt means l have customers
that rely on me.

158
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,145
Yeah, so what?

159
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,487
So...

160
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,481
l'm not gonna let you fuck this up
with your guilt and paranoia.

161
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,068
l say it's done, it's done.

162
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:33,991
No.

163
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,486
You quit,

164
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:38,412
l go to the warden,
l tell him everything.

165
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,661
He puts me in the hole
for a little while, big deal.

166
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,868
You,

167
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:44,081
you lose your job,

168
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,502
you probably do some time,

169
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,836
leaving little Didi

170
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:55,516
a motherless child, scarred for life.

171
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,388
No, you wouldn't do that.

172
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,101
Why wouldn't l?

173
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,360
Diane,

174
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:06,893
you and me,

175
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:09,439
we're joined at the hip.

176
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,654
And ain't nothing
you can do about that.

177
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,406
Turn on me again,
your life ain't worth shit.

178
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,549
She's a damn fine woman,
our Diane.

179
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:27,880
Damn fine woman.

180
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,221
Hey, who's that?

181
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:42,220
Oh, new guy.

182
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,480
Some Polack.

183
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,028
lf the Muslims riot, we're ready.

184
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:00,282
Angels, Aryans.

185
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,781
What about the Homeboys?

186
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,290
Adebisi says they're on our side,

187
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,707
but l don't think we should fight
the Muslims if we can avoid it.

188
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,798
Oh, what, are you going soft on me,
O'Reily?

189
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,720
No, l'm just trying to stay alive.

190
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,182
What?

191
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,347
Hey.

192
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:21,725
What are you doing?

193
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,349
Nothing.

194
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:24,728
Yeah?

195
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:27,064
Why don't you do it
somewhere else?

196
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:32,695
Stupid hacks.

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,157
- You're the lookout.
- l'm on the lookout.

198
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:37,741
Go on, look out.

199
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,532
Damn.

200
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:46,834
- Hey, l'm Anthony Nowakowski.
- You're late.

201
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,297
l had never been to Oswald before.
l got lost coming off Route 7 A.

202
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,082
l'm Diane Wittlesey.
This is Joe Mineo.

203
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,921
Don't be late again.

204
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:56,970
Another fucking newbie.

205
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:59,969
Joe's been around
for about two centuries.

206
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,052
There's been a lot
of suspensions lately.

207
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:05,598
So l hear. Officers beating up
inmates on a regular basis.

208
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:09,230
- He killed one of our guys.
- Some of the COs decided

209
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:11,691
to take it out
on any prisoner they could find.

210
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:14,574
Things got a little tense,
but l'm hoping we're past it.

211
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,277
Yeah.

212
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:22,371
Also hear you got a couple
of celebrities in this cell block?

213
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:26,742
That's Kareem Said.
He's the big muckety-muck Muslim.

214
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,794
lt's time.

215
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:31,835
l want you to start
an argument with the guard.

216
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,292
Get him to swing on you.

217
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,343
But he must hit you first,
you understand?

218
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:37,676
Yes.

219
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,840
And after he hits me...

220
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:48,015
That's Eugene Dobbins.

221
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:51,353
- He's some classical kind of musician.
- Hey, Dobbs.

222
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,567
Used to play the cello
till somebody smashed it.

223
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:56,276
- Wanna go to the library?
- No.

224
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,572
Come on, man. Gym?

225
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,237
Leave me alone.

226
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,493
Now he sits in front
of the boob tube all day.

227
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:09,577
And that's Jackson Vahue.

228
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,207
Vahue?

229
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:13,462
Oh, yeah, man, you see
that game against the Bulls?

230
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,006
Fifty-eight fucking points.
That guy's amazing.

231
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:20,465
Rebadow.

232
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,591
Your factory supervisor says
you haven't been to work

233
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:26,010
- for a couple of days.
- God lied to me.

234
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,851
- God lied to you?
- Yes.

235
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:32,232
Well, why should God be
so different than anyone else?

236
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,982
Oh, shit. l'm late for a meeting.

237
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,728
l used to have meetings.

238
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,150
They never do any good, you know.

239
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:18,107
Prisoner number 65R81 4,
Robert Rebadow.

240
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,819
Convicted September 9th, '65.

241
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:22,321
Murder in the first degree.

242
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,570
Sentence: Death.

243
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:26,739
Commuted to life.

244
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,867
l'm beginning to think
l never really talked to God.

245
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:37,332
That everything l thought l heard
was actually my own powers of reason.

246
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:42,090
McManus, you're a man of reason too,
but you've gotten lost.

247
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,631
Yeah, well, right now l'm late.

248
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,056
Go to work, Rebadow.

249
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,901
- Hey, Tim, l want you to meet--
- Later.

250
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:01,149
- Hey, Ray.
- Tim, how are you doing?

251
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,653
We get the hostages.

252
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:10,241
Hey, Miguel. Could you guys
excuse us for a second?

253
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,080
Hey, whatever you gotta say to me,
you can say in front of them.

254
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,622
Take a hike.

255
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:26,343
What the fuck is that?

256
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:28,345
Jose Torres got paroled.

257
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:30,847
Lucky prick.

258
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:33,021
So l hear that you're running
the gang now.

259
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:36,478
Ain't listening to gossip a sin?

260
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:38,816
- Miguel--
- Hey, Father,

261
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,864
the only reason why l didn't beat
the shit out of you just now

262
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:44,481
is because you've been there
for me.

263
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:46,529
Don't push your luck.

264
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,494
Okay?

265
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,160
- Okay, where was l?
- Losing.

266
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:02,297
- You--? You move this piece?
- No.

267
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:07,305
- Yes, you did.
- No, l didn't.

268
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,716
You fucking moved the pieces.

269
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:11,892
You've been doing it all along.

270
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:14,595
Every time l have to take a shit,

271
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:16,357
you move the pieces.

272
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:18,642
That's why l'm fucking losing!

273
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,988
- You keep losing because you suck.
- You motherfucking bastard!

274
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:26,233
Hey, break it up!

275
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:29,860
Hey, break it up!

276
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,703
Get off of him!

277
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:06,158
- Yeah?
- Hunt, send Armstrong out here now.

278
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:09,948
Armstrong, get out there.
Hurry up.

279
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,324
All right.

280
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:20,041
Hey, bitch.

281
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:23,456
- Take that.
- Sucks, motherfucker!

282
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,434
Get down, motherfucker!

283
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,228
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

284
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,246
Shit.

285
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,330
Miguel, Miguel.

286
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:04,505
No! Miguel!

287
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:07,212
Don't! No!

288
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:14,302
You all know what
you're supposed to do. Let's go.

289
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,105
Easiest sucker yet. Come on.

290
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,692
Shut down all the cell blocks
immediately. Cut off the phones.

291
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:18,326
- What's happening?
- Our worst nightmare.

292
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:17,506
Now let's get organised.

293
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:34,155
- This is Warden Glynn.
- Fuck you.

294
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,571
Surrender immediately,
there will be no repercussions.

295
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:46,783
Fuck you!

296
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:49,376
ls there anyone in charge?

297
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:54,668
ls there anyone in there
we can talk to?

298
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:57,346
Said.

299
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:01,551
Said. Said.

300
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:04,348
Said. Said. Said.

301
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,391
Said. Said. Said.

302
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,104
Said. Said. Said.

303
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:12,565
Said. Said.

304
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:15,573
Said. Said. Said.

305
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,576
Said. Said. Said.

306
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:21,614
Said. Said. Said.

307
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,487
Gentlemen.

308
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,202
What's this about, Said?

309
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:28,410
lf you have to ask, Glynn,

310
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,665
we got a long day ahead of us.

311
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,891
- Because l made two dollars.
- Man, fuck you.

312
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:46,642
Yeah, motherfucker. Yeah, yeah.

313
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:07,572
Glynn has given us time
to come up with a list of demands.

314
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:11,208
But l think the most important element
is that we remain united.

315
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,090
- l don't have a problem with that.
- Me neither.

316
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,208
As long as you get
a few ground rules laid down.

317
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,092
Such as?

318
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:21,804
Well, you're not the boss.

319
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:24,966
l am willing to share the power.

320
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:27,765
- That is why l asked you here.
- Yes.

321
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:31,763
You see, we can become
a kind of council.

322
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:34,023
We will, together,
make all the decisions.

323
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:35,896
We can talk
parliamentary procedure later.

324
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:38,396
- How many guns do you have?
- Just the one.

325
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:41,402
- l don't believe you.
- You'll have to learn to trust me,

326
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,450
just like l'm gonna
have to learn to trust you.

327
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,778
Yeah, but you got the gun,

328
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:47,955
and that gives you
one up on the rest of us.

329
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:52,164
That's right. You know, l hear you
talking about sharing power,

330
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:54,170
but l can't turn my back on you.

331
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:55,412
Okay.

332
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:59,048
How would you like me
to demonstrate my sincerity?

333
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,422
Give me the gun.

334
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,378
What?

335
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:04,630
Okay, okay.

336
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,219
How about we divide up
the responsibility?

337
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,678
Look, O'Reily, Ross, Adebisi,

338
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:13,435
you already have control
of the front entrance.

339
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,399
l propose O'Reily be our spokesman
when dealing with Glynn.

340
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,984
Ross, you be in control
of the distribution of food.

341
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:22,570
Adebisi, all of the comings
and goings.

342
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:24,777
My men should have the hostages.

343
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,952
Okay.

344
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:28,409
You gonna have to give up Hunt.

345
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:31,375
- No way.
- We all have to give up something.

346
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:35,370
lt is much more efficient
to have all the hostages in one place.

347
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:36,834
He's got a point.

348
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:40,334
Besides, as long as we got
control of the gate,

349
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,673
hacks aren't going anywhere.

350
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,593
So we all agreed then?

351
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,265
- Yo.
- Yeah.

352
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:47,803
All right.

353
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:51,513
So all that remains
is the list of demands.

354
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:53,136
Who wants to start?

355
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:56,600
- l want some more girls.
- This ban on smoking is bullshit.

356
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:03,401
We gotta get the wounded
to a separate place, Arif.

357
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:07,158
- The shower room?
- Yeah, good idea. Go.

358
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:12,493
Dobbins? Yo, Dob--
Yo, can l get a hand here?

359
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,667
Could somebody help me, please?

360
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,414
Dobbins. Oh, man.

361
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:20,419
Let's take him to the shower room.

362
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:26,715
Go ahead.

363
00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:37,055
- You'll always be my hero, man.
- That's me. Fucking role model.

364
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:40,395
lt's priceless to me, and that's why
it's locked in the chaplain's office.

365
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,150
You'll do what l tell you to do
or l'm just gonna fuck you up.

366
00:26:43,323 --> 00:26:45,529
Hey, Jackson,
you leave Dobbins alone, man.

367
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,029
You butt out of this, all right?

368
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,491
Hey, this is all l could find.

369
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,537
They burned everything else.

370
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:59,747
Oh, shit.

371
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,708
That don't look good, man.

372
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,083
Fuck, l had a friend in a fight
get stabbed like that.

373
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:06,342
He died right in the middle
of Polanski Boulevard.

374
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:09,798
Dobbins don't get to a hospital soon, he
gonna be trading that cello for a harp.

375
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,683
This fucking guy
and his goddamn cello.

376
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,266
You broke it, didn't you?
Didn't you?

377
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:17,771
- No, man. No, no. No, no.
- You gotta take him to ER.

378
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:20,521
No. All right, Hill, l go out there,
they kick my fucking ass.

379
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:22,603
They're gonna kick in
our asses anyway, brother.

380
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,404
No, man.
Hey, this ain't my fault, Hill.

381
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,364
Yo, he is definitely
not my problem, man.

382
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,319
l did not start all this shit, Hill.

383
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,035
What difference does it make, huh?

384
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:32,445
You think because of who you are
you can pick and choose

385
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:35,826
when to take responsibility. You can't.
Sometimes you got to step up.

386
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,032
All right? Look at him.

387
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,752
Hey, look at him.

388
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:43,628
Dobbins, that cello, that's all he had,
man. lt's like me and that chair.

389
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:47,590
lt's who he was.
lt's like you and basketball.

390
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:53,599
Come on, man. You're all right.
lt's okay. Good. Just hold on.

391
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:54,848
All right, all right.

392
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,511
All right, look. All right, fuck it.
Fuck it. Yo, yo, fuck it.

393
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:59,183
l been hit before.
Come on, come on.

394
00:27:59,357 --> 00:28:00,982
- Just grab him, man.
- Come on, Dobbs.

395
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,651
Open the gate.

396
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,527
- Come on.
- Come on, yo.

397
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:06,941
l gotta get Dobbs to the hospital.

398
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:08,900
- Fuck Dobbs.
- Yo, let us out!

399
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:12,071
- Yeah, let him out, man.
- What could you do?

400
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:14,445
- What's up, brothers?
- Dobbs is dying, man.

401
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,948
Let's dump him before he starts
getting mouldy, all right?

402
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,533
- Okay.
- What about Said and Alvarez?

403
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:22,422
lf you vote yes, that's a majority.
We don't need them at all.

404
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:24,997
Let's do what l'm saying.
lf the three of us hang together,

405
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:27,251
Said's our bitch.

406
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:30,631
- Okay.
- Let's go. Come on, man.

407
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,503
Hey.

408
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:36,098
We're letting out
one wounded prisoner.

409
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,054
Tell Glynn.

410
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,602
Open the gate.

411
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:57,279
l'll see you, all right?

412
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,660
Yeah.

413
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:11,756
- Hold on, man.
- Drop him, asshole.

414
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:14,463
- Damn. Somebody help him.
- Shut the fuck up, basketball boy.

415
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,432
- Fuck!
- Cuff him.

416
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:18,596
Shit.

417
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,850
We got one of those bastards.

418
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:30,090
Hello.

419
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:31,918
Hope you don't mind,
l gotta take a shit.

420
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,382
- Beecher, listen--
- Hey.

421
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:39,009
You know, l'm standing here
thinking about

422
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,975
all the good times we've had,
you and me.

423
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:43,723
l don't wanna fight.

424
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:46,729
Oh, no, of course not.

425
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:50,026
You get into a fight,
you fuck up your parole.

426
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:53,985
And l hear for the next three months,
you're gonna be a good little boy.

427
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,951
So you can get out of Oz,
save your two sons.

428
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:01,988
You know, l think that's great.

429
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,163
But you know what l'm wondering?

430
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,871
What if Vern doesn't get out?

431
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,133
What if, as he comes up for parole,
he gets into a brawl,

432
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:17,588
a knockdown-dragout
with his old roomie?

433
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:24,977
What if every time
he comes up for parole,

434
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:29,097
Vern gets into some ugly incident,

435
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:33,611
and has to serve
his entire sentence?

436
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:35,861
And his two sons,

437
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,031
they become monsters.

438
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,372
That's what l'm wondering about.

439
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,250
Prag.

440
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,422
l got it bad

441
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:55,295
And that ain't good

442
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:02,679
We love to root for the underdog.

443
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,055
You know,

444
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,934
at halftime, when one team is getting
their asses handed to them

445
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:11,440
and they're headed to the locker room,
we say a silent prayer.

446
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,652
We pray that when they come back,
they'll turn it around, they'll score,

447
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:18,605
they'll beat those cocky
sons of bitches, yeah!

448
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:22,322
We love it when someone
comes up from behind.

449
00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:28,418
We have to figure out
a way to escape.

450
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,619
- How?
- l don't know, but l can't just sit here

451
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:33,915
- waiting to get raped.
- Or killed.

452
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,006
You really think
they're gonna kill us?

453
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:38,928
No, they're gonna invite us for tea.

454
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:40,513
Armstrong?

455
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,928
ls he gonna be all right?

456
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:46,590
You sit down over there with them.

457
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:50,263
- What's the matter with Armstrong?
- Shut up, Hunt, sit the fuck down.

458
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,854
l'm in charge
of you motherfuckers now.

459
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,853
l don't know how long
this shit's gonna last,

460
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:57,780
but if you don't give me any trouble,
you walk out of here alive.

461
00:32:57,948 --> 00:32:58,979
Okay?

462
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:02,284
We've all been beaten badly.
Armstrong needs a doctor.

463
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:08,666
- Armstrong.
- Hey. Hey.

464
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,544
Hey.

465
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:17,045
- l'll see what l can do.
- l gotta piss.

466
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,258
Father, you're friendly with Alvarez,
aren't you?

467
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,142
l thought l was.

468
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:31,430
He let them take me
without lifting a finger.

469
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,851
You didn't really think that he'd
lift a finger to help you, did you?

470
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,778
He'd get whacked
if he tried to help you.

471
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:48,028
You know what it's like
in the hole, right?

472
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:49,790
You get a bucket to piss and shit in.

473
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,248
Stays with you the whole time.

474
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,831
Go ahead.

475
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,003
Uncuff me.

476
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:07,092
No.

477
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,969
You know that joke
you made when my baby died?

478
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,106
Fucking cocksucker!

479
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:18,059
- Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
- For God's sake, stop it!

480
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:20,278
Miguel!

481
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,402
- What the fuck is going on?
- Look. Look, right now,

482
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:27,328
- l can't change shit if l wanted to.
- Maybe you can't change shit,

483
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:29,369
but you don't have to give in
to the brutality.

484
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:32,326
- You're so fucking naive.
- Naive?

485
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,701
l'm not naive.

486
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:36,243
l'm afraid.

487
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:39,630
Yeah? Well, so am l, hermano.

488
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,549
So am l.

489
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:47,344
We have unconfirmed
reports that a riot

490
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:49,799
has erupted
at Oswald State Penitentiary.

491
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:52,681
Correction officials and the governor
will neither confirm nor deny

492
00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:54,348
that a riot broke out in the prison,

493
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:56,562
which has been plagued with violence
in recent months.

494
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:58,892
lt's under the tight scrutiny
of the Devlin administration...

495
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:01,607
- Move.
- Let him up.

496
00:35:01,822 --> 00:35:03,814
--investigation into
the rash of murders there.

497
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,900
And though the warden,
Leo Glynn, has assured us

498
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:08,946
that nothing unusual is happening,
if recent events are any indication,

499
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,579
a riot would be almost inevitable.

500
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:12,656
So, Alvarez,

501
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:14,416
how are the hostages?

502
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:16,329
They need a doctor.

503
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:17,955
Well, l say we get them one.

504
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,751
Because we don't wanna seem
like savages now, do we?

505
00:35:23,677 --> 00:35:26,843
Of course, you're gonna have
to clear that with all the others.

506
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,716
Okay.

507
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:38,308
Adebisi, you gotta slow down
on that shit.

508
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,143
Why?

509
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:43,987
Because we need our fucking heads
to be together right now.

510
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:45,312
Besides,

511
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:49,197
if this situation gets worse,
we're gonna run out of that stuff.

512
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,539
And l don't want you detoxing on me
when l need you the most.

513
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,626
You worry too much, pretty boy.

514
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:59,497
Have some.

515
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:01,380
No.

516
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,377
l've been clean
since my time in the hole.

517
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:08,216
Clean for what, huh?

518
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,132
- l'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Hey! Hey!

519
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,267
Hey, break it up! Break it up!

520
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:18,521
- Fuck this, man! Fuck you!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

521
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,442
This is exactly what those dicks
out there are hoping for.

522
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:22,766
Said too.

523
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:24,522
Hey.

524
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:27,655
Why do you think
he gave you guys the archway for?

525
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:29,775
He's waiting for one side
to kill the other--

526
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,446
- And then--
- Let's do that. Fuck it!

527
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,493
He's gonna kill whoever's left,
all right?

528
00:36:33,663 --> 00:36:35,739
We gotta stick together, Wangler.

529
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,160
Hey, Kenny.

530
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:41,707
Cool down.

531
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,664
Yo, there's a couple of hacks
that are in pretty bad shape,

532
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:48,755
so Said and l
wanna get them a doctor.

533
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:50,759
How do you vote?

534
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:55,720
No.

535
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:58,014
Fuck that.

536
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,523
Yo, O'Reily,

537
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,235
it's 2 to 2.

538
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,567
You can break the tie.

539
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:11,361
Yeah, break the tie.

540
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:15,194
- What's it worth to you, Alvarez?
- What is it worth to me?

541
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:16,910
Yeah.

542
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:19,241
What will you give me for my vote?

543
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:20,657
Nothing.

544
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,287
Let the fuckers die.

545
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:35,673
Fucking bunch of niggers.

546
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:37,885
Had an uncle who was a drunk.

547
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:40,890
We tried to get him some new hobbies
to keep him from drinking.

548
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:43,976
Got him into sculpting school.
Didn't help.

549
00:37:44,192 --> 00:37:45,817
Kept coming home plastered.

550
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:47,687
Oh, Jesus Christ.

551
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:51,191
Had another uncle
who was a rare-coin dealer.

552
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:55,193
One day, a couple of tough guys came
into the place and beat him senseless.

553
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,401
Stop.

554
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:59,327
Got another uncle
who owned a grocery store.

555
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:03,331
One night, somebody comes and caves
his head in with a case of corn flakes.

556
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:04,873
The cops think it might have been

557
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:06,541
- a cereal killer.
- A cereal killer.

558
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,040
D'Agnasti, shut the fuck up.

559
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,631
Just trying to break the tension.

560
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:17,050
Sorry, no doctor.

561
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,269
- Miguel, you gotta do something.
- Yeah, l know.

562
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,559
l been working as an orderly
in the prison hospital, so...

563
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:27,444
Oh, so, what, now you're
an M.D. all of a sudden?

564
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:29,734
All you're good for
is cleaning up shit.

565
00:38:29,946 --> 00:38:31,191
Shut up, Eddie.

566
00:38:31,406 --> 00:38:32,735
l used to work as a nurse's aide,

567
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:34,865
- l could give you a hand.
- No fucking way.

568
00:38:40,624 --> 00:38:44,158
Look, we gave them a couple of hours
to come up with their list of demands.

569
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:47,290
Before we take any action, we might
as well wait and see what they want.

570
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:49,456
l say no negotiations.

571
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:51,418
l say we cut off
the water and electricity,

572
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:54,428
and then tonight, when they're sitting
in the dark, we fire tear gas.

573
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:55,711
What about the hostages?

574
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:57,549
Hopefully, the SORT team
will reach them.

575
00:38:57,724 --> 00:38:59,633
Hopefully?
We don't even know where they are.

576
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,016
Or if they're alive.
Said says he's got seven hostages.

577
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:04,393
- How do we know for sure?
- We ask to see them.

578
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:08,016
The longer we wait, the more chance
we're giving them to dig in.

579
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:10,108
And even though we've sealed off
that section

580
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:13,528
and locked down all the cell blocks, the
other inmates know what's going on.

581
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:16,071
We're sitting on a time bomb.

582
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,612
l'm going public.

583
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,659
l'm sending in the National Guard
to surround Oswald.

584
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes?

585
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,461
Okay.

586
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:31,921
That was Hofmeister.

587
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:33,332
The rioters want food.

588
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,386
There's no reason
to give them anything.

589
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:38,221
Oh, yeah, let's starve them out.

590
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:43,097
Governor, l see no harm
in sending in some sandwiches.

591
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:45,019
- l'll take them inside.
- What?

592
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:47,347
Yeah, as a condition
for giving them food,

593
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:49,932
we tell them they have to let me
check on the hostages.

594
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,520
You're going in there voluntarily?

595
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,030
Yeah.

596
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:58,024
You're even stupider than l thought.

597
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,823
Hello.

598
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:14,964
- Leave it there.
- No.

599
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:18,133
The deal was l get
to see the hostages.

600
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:21,134
You, alone.

601
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:25,019
- Dinner is served.
- Help yourself, boys.

602
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:26,972
- Who says your boys--?
- l fucking say--

603
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:28,475
- Oh, yeah? Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

604
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:30,440
For chrissake!
We'll serve the sandwiches

605
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:33,978
the same way we do in the cafeteria.
Jesus Christ.

606
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:36,313
Where are the hostages?

607
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,197
l'll show you.

608
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:42,530
Okay, gents, line the fuck up.

609
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:44,747
One.

610
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:46,909
One.

611
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:49,251
l said one, Wangler.

612
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:09,763
Are these two okay?

613
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,313
They'd be better off in a hospital.

614
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:14,726
- How about the rest of you?
- We're fine.

615
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:16,646
No thanks to these cocksuckers.

616
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:19,150
- Diane?
- No one touched her,

617
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,652
if that's what you mean.

618
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:21,988
Was l talking to you?

619
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:24,358
Watch your mouth, McManus.

620
00:41:24,538 --> 00:41:26,246
You ain't king of shit
around here no more.

621
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:27,577
Are there any other hostages?

622
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,247
No, not that we know of.

623
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,792
What would it take to get
these two and her set free?

624
00:41:35,382 --> 00:41:37,042
Gotta put it to a vote.

625
00:41:38,677 --> 00:41:40,883
Why don't you just stand?

626
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,843
So

627
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:51,226
you let them go, l stay.

628
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,097
Three for one?

629
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,691
Not even trade.

630
00:41:57,195 --> 00:42:00,896
lf Mineo and Armstrong die,
you will be held responsible.

631
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:03,689
We're talking death sentence here.

632
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,067
So okay.

633
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:06,745
The two of them go,

634
00:42:06,955 --> 00:42:08,153
but Wittlesey stays.

635
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:10,997
- Then no deal.
- McManus,

636
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:14,210
l don't think you fully grasp
your current position here.

637
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:16,994
We don't have to let any
of them go, or you.

638
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,878
You taking me prisoner?
You gonna go back on your word?

639
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:22,589
We have every intention
of fulfilling our part of the bargain.

640
00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:24,596
Why should we?

641
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:26,799
Because if we lie to them,

642
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:28,890
we become just like them.

643
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,136
And we won't get
our list of demands.

644
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:34,723
l say we let Armstrong
and Mineo go.

645
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:36,139
Me too.

646
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:38,524
Who else? Adebisi?

647
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:41,153
Yeah, fine.

648
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:42,609
Ross?

649
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:46,692
Oh, well, Wittlesey's gotta stay.

650
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:51,790
Said?

651
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:55,951
Okay.

652
00:43:08,558 --> 00:43:12,259
This is a letter for Glynn from
McManus explaining the exchange.

653
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:14,645
Here's our demands.

654
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:18,185
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

655
00:43:23,824 --> 00:43:26,445
They want to speak directly
to the media, uncensored.

656
00:43:26,618 --> 00:43:28,990
Sure, we'll put them on
right after Seinfeld.

657
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:31,493
There are to be no reprisals
or repercussions

658
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:33,159
to any inmate involved in the riot.

659
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,906
Oh, Jesus Christ,
why don't they just ask to go free?

660
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:39,953
You know, most of these
demands are harmless.

661
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:42,249
Bring back conjugal visits, smoking--

662
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,626
Yeah, well, l reject all their demands.

663
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:46,511
l won't negotiate with animals.

664
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:51,098
Then how do you expect me
to end the situation?

665
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:53,801
The old-fashioned way.

666
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:55,350
By force.

667
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:03,311
This is all your fucking fault,
McManus.

668
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,653
- Shut up, Eddie.
- No.

669
00:44:05,866 --> 00:44:07,146
Goddamn it.

670
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:10,534
lf l'm gonna die, at least l want the
bastard that got me whacked to know it.

671
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:12,281
How can you blame Tim?

672
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:13,528
How?

673
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:17,621
Because of all
this Emerald City bullshit.

674
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:22,545
Because Tim thought
he could help these cocksuckers.

675
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:25,090
l've seen you in action, pal.

676
00:44:25,886 --> 00:44:29,586
l've seen you fumble the fucking ball
every single play.

677
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,466
l just hope if we do die,
l get to watch you go first.

678
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:50,034
Oh, fuck.

679
00:44:51,244 --> 00:44:53,284
Oh, Christ.

680
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:05,418
l gotta see Said.
l wanna talk to Said.

681
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:06,796
l don't know.

682
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,385
Please, Miguel.

683
00:45:08,595 --> 00:45:13,506
l like that.
l like it when you beg, McManus.

684
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:17,894
Said,

685
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:22,099
l grew up in a small town
in upstate New York.

686
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:24,559
There was only one major
industry there.

687
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:25,892
The prison.

688
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:28,319
Everybody's parents
either worked at the prison

689
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:30,820
or made a living from, you know,

690
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:33,780
motels, gas stations,

691
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:36,617
or, like my dad, had a diner.

692
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:38,871
Right across the street.

693
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:40,911
lt was the fall.

694
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:43,827
We'd just gone back to school.

695
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,249
l was about to turn 1 0,

696
00:45:46,466 --> 00:45:48,791
so l was very, very excited.

697
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:52,047
A few days before my birthday
though,

698
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,638
there was this riot.

699
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:58,056
And it lasted four days.

700
00:45:58,603 --> 00:46:02,103
But then the governor
authorised 2,500 troops,

701
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:04,189
state troopers,

702
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:08,400
to go back in, take it back.

703
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:10,905
They did.

704
00:46:11,158 --> 00:46:13,862
Firing at anything that moved.

705
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:17,950
So when the tear gas cleared,

706
00:46:18,748 --> 00:46:22,793
31 inmates
and nine hostages were dead.

707
00:46:24,296 --> 00:46:25,494
Attica.

708
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:31,177
Three of my friends' fathers were shot.

709
00:46:32,512 --> 00:46:34,754
lnstead of going to a birthday party,

710
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:39,137
l went with my family
to a memorial service.

711
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:41,974
So that's what this is all about?

712
00:46:43,064 --> 00:46:46,350
Emerald City is your birthday party.

713
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:49,402
Look,

714
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,981
l built Em City

715
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:55,034
because l wanna
make a better world.

716
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:57,160
For you.

717
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,363
For all of you.

718
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:02,406
Right now we're
on the edge of oblivion,

719
00:47:02,626 --> 00:47:05,627
we're on the brink of disaster.

720
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:09,373
Now, before we
all join hands and jump,

721
00:47:10,383 --> 00:47:11,628
l want another chance.

722
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:14,132
- Not mine to give.
- Yes, it is!

723
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:15,804
No, it's not!

724
00:47:16,014 --> 00:47:19,549
Because even the best prison
wouldn't be good enough!

725
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,221
l'm gonna try one more time
with you, McManus.

726
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,227
Now, l am not saying that the men
in Oz are innocent.

727
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:31,314
l'm saying they are not here because of
the crimes that they committed,

728
00:47:31,488 --> 00:47:33,362
but because of the colour
of their skin,

729
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:37,701
their lack of education,
the fact that they are poor.

730
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:40,996
You see, this riot is not
about getting smoking back,

731
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:45,500
conjugal rights,
it's not even about life in prison.

732
00:47:46,253 --> 00:47:49,254
lt's about society
taking responsibility.

733
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:53,213
lt's about the whole
horrid judicial system.

734
00:47:54,177 --> 00:47:59,088
And we don't need more prisons,
bigger prisons, better prisons.

735
00:47:59,391 --> 00:48:02,096
We need better justice.

736
00:48:02,644 --> 00:48:04,186
Now, what can you do about that?

737
00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:14,068
lf we don't resolve this, you and me,

738
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:16,320
and soon,

739
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,739
people will die.

740
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,494
You could die.

741
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:23,954
l am willing to lay down my life

742
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:26,033
for change.

743
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:28,910
Now, those deaths at Attica,

744
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:33,672
they brought real changes,
with real reforms.

745
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:38,335
But everybody's forgotten
the lessons of your little hometown.

746
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:42,136
Time to wake this country up
again, McManus.

747
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,592
Said, we gotta talk.

748
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:47,267
You wanna save this place, right?

749
00:48:47,731 --> 00:48:50,222
And l wanna destroy it.

750
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:53,478
Brick by hypocritical brick.

751
00:48:54,488 --> 00:48:57,061
Wait, wait.

752
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,077
- Let me out of here!
- This isn't working.

753
00:49:01,077 --> 00:49:02,026
- Let me out of here!
- This isn't working.

754
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:04,445
- What?
- The entranceway. Every ten minutes

755
00:49:04,623 --> 00:49:07,577
l'm putting a fire out between
the Gangsters and the Nazis.

756
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:10,420
Well, put the Aryans in another part
of the cell block.

757
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:14,205
They'll want something in exchange
for giving up the security office.

758
00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:17,052
Switch them with the Latinos.
They can take care of the hostages.

759
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,092
Okay. There's something else.

760
00:49:19,262 --> 00:49:20,591
- What?
- We're out of heroin.

761
00:49:20,764 --> 00:49:22,306
- Good.
- Says you.

762
00:49:22,516 --> 00:49:24,888
Adebisi and his pals
are starting to fiend.

763
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,427
This is gonna get real ugly, real fast.

764
00:49:27,604 --> 00:49:30,890
When and if that happens,
l will be ready.

765
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:33,065
What are you gonna do?

766
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:37,774
Don't you fucking
walk away from me, Said!

767
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:41,156
- Enough!
- Back off, Beecher, back off.

768
00:49:42,536 --> 00:49:44,575
Arif!

769
00:49:49,835 --> 00:49:51,874
Everybody go back.

770
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:20,197
l gotta find some--

771
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:24,694
- l'm dying for some tits, man.
- Me too, little buddy, me too.

772
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:28,032
They gotta be somewhere,
somewhere around here.

773
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:33,081
Follow me. Come, come.

774
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:37,881
Come.

775
00:50:41,428 --> 00:50:44,298
Go through every pod.
See whatever drug you can find. Go.

776
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:46,264
Go. Go, go. Go there. Go, go!

777
00:50:47,017 --> 00:50:48,594
Let's go.

778
00:50:48,768 --> 00:50:50,428
Go!

779
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,031
Where are the tits?

780
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,036
Where are the tits?

781
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:17,039
Where are the bloody tits?

782
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:19,337
- Where are the tits?
- l got no fucking tits, man.

783
00:51:20,926 --> 00:51:22,384
Where are the fucking tits?

784
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,296
Where are they?

785
00:51:25,472 --> 00:51:27,132
Where are the tits?

786
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:29,258
Adebisi!

787
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:38,648
lt's finished!

788
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:41,109
lt's over.

789
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:42,821
Come on.

790
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:58,002
Police. Police.

791
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:05,506
Execution day, baby.

792
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:13,886
Prisoner number 93A234,
Simon Adebisi.

793
00:52:14,104 --> 00:52:16,227
Convicted May 2nd, '93.

794
00:52:16,398 --> 00:52:17,975
Murder in the first degree.

795
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,443
Sentence: Life in prison
without the possibility of parole.

796
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:27,568
Go ahead.

797
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,487
Kill me.

798
00:52:34,374 --> 00:52:36,082
l don't wanna kill you.

799
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:38,997
l know. You wanna save my ass.

800
00:52:39,212 --> 00:52:41,039
- Yes, l wanna save you.
- Please,

801
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,423
give me some tits.

802
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:47,625
Give me some tits!

803
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:53,267
Give me some fucking tits!

804
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,179
They say,
''lt don't matter if you win or lose,

805
00:52:57,355 --> 00:52:59,478
it's how you play the game. ''

806
00:52:59,649 --> 00:53:01,476
l call bullshit on that.

807
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:04,818
lt's all about winning, brother.
That's the object of the game.

808
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:07,312
What is that?

809
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:09,282
The beginning and the end,
my brother.

810
00:53:09,493 --> 00:53:12,114
The beginning and the end.
Okay, everybody,

811
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:14,956
they're about to make their move.

812
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:16,665
Bring out the hostages.

813
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,541
Please, untie me.

814
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,703
You shouldn't have stolen
my fucking watch.

815
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:23,335
Untie me. Hey, don't be like that.

816
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:26,543
- Untie me!
- Stand in a straight line.

817
00:53:26,718 --> 00:53:30,467
When they come in, you get hit first.

818
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,975
- Any last words?
- Suck my dick.

819
00:53:38,688 --> 00:53:40,348
lf only there were time.

820
00:53:47,948 --> 00:53:49,774
Hit the ground.

821
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,325
Said.

822
00:53:54,412 --> 00:53:57,200
Fuck. Open the fucking door, man.

823
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:01,241
Fuck.

824
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,166
Yeah, motherfuckers!

825
00:54:41,084 --> 00:54:45,497
Yeah, who cares
who lives or dies in prison?

826
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:49,255
We read the names in the morning
paper and they mean nothing to us.

827
00:54:49,426 --> 00:54:51,169
They're faceless.

828
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,343
Truth is, we don't wanna
put a face on them.

829
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:56,218
We don't wanna know
who they really are.

830
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:59,096
Because then it might hit
too close to home.

831
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:02,104
And home is what
it's all about, right?

832
00:55:02,314 --> 00:55:04,353
Making a home no matter
where you are,

833
00:55:04,524 --> 00:55:06,066
no matter who you are.

834
00:55:06,234 --> 00:55:09,734
At the end of the day,
everybody wants somewhere to rest,

835
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:12,193
somewhere to lay their bones,

836
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:15,283
even if it's in a land called Oz.

837
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:17,487
Yeah.

838
00:55:17,704 --> 00:55:21,998
Like Dorothy says when she wakes up
in her own bed back at Aunt Em's:

839
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:24,664
''There's no place like home.''

840
00:55:25,462 --> 00:55:29,246
There's no fucking place like home.
