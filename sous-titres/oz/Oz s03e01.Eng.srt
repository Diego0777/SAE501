1
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:25,220
The name on the street for
the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary.

2
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:28,086
Only, big news: They've changed the name.

3
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:33,021
<i>It's now called the Oswald State</i>
<i>Correctional Facility, Level Four.</i>

4
00:57:33,629 --> 00:57:37,224
L don't know what the difference is.
Leo Glynn is still warden.

5
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:40,035
Sister Peter Marie is still in psych.

6
00:57:40,102 --> 00:57:43,230
Tim McManus is still unit manager
of Emerald City.

7
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:45,968
And l know for damn sure
none of us have changed.

8
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:49,808
<i>Beecher is still in the hospital</i>
<i>after Schillinger and Keller broke his bones.</i>

9
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:53,110
<i>Alvarez is still in solitary</i>
<i>after blinding a CO.</i>

10
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:57,078
<i>Adebisi, still in the loony ward,</i>
<i>after changing hats.</i>

11
00:57:58,054 --> 00:58:00,215
Maybe it's truth in advertising.

12
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,587
Maybe by getting rid
of the word "penitentiary"...

13
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:06,094
the state is finally admitting
that nobody's penitent.

14
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:08,220
Nobody's sorry.

15
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:10,959
Nobody.

16
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:14,159
In an ongoing crusade
to curb state spending...

17
00:58:14,236 --> 00:58:17,467
l have initiated a policy
to put some government services...

18
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,474
in the hands of outside contractors.

19
00:58:20,076 --> 00:58:22,408
<i>Today l am pleased to announce...</i>

20
00:58:22,478 --> 00:58:25,914
<i>that Weigert,</i>
<i>a private-managed care corporation...</i>

21
00:58:26,015 --> 00:58:28,677
<i>will take over health maintenance</i>
<i>in our prison system.</i>

22
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:32,778
<i>A move that will save taxpayers $28 million.</i>

23
00:58:32,855 --> 00:58:33,844
Fuck you.

24
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:36,653
<i>But cutting costs will not cut quality.</i>

25
00:58:37,827 --> 00:58:41,456
And so l'd like to introduce
Dr. Frederick Garvey...

26
00:58:41,931 --> 00:58:44,593
who will head the Weigert team. Dr. Garvey.

27
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:47,192
Thank you, Governor Devlin.

28
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:51,638
Weigert is dedicated
to giving the best possible care...

29
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:56,171
to the 36,000 inmates
currently serving time in our state.

30
00:58:56,879 --> 00:59:00,474
We will do that by securing
the best talent available.

31
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:04,411
And though we can't guarantee
everyone a job...

32
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:08,881
our hope is to keep
as many staff members as possible...

33
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:13,490
offering competitive wages and benefits.
Thank you.

34
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,006
<i>Solitary confinement.</i>

35
00:59:33,315 --> 00:59:36,682
<i>In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville...</i>

36
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:39,448
<i>visited this country</i>
<i>to study our penal system.</i>

37
00:59:41,824 --> 00:59:46,784
<i>American penitentiaries were considered</i>
<i>the ideal, enlightened way to rehabilitation.</i>

38
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:53,968
<i>Putting a criminal in solitary</i>
<i>allowed him time for quiet reflection.</i>

39
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:00,872
<i>But no man wants to think</i>
<i>about himself all day...</i>

40
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:04,208
<i>face the truth about himself every day...</i>

41
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:07,573
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

42
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:13,655
"Alvarez, Miguel."

43
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:17,458
He's on 200 mils of Zoloft.

44
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:21,053
He has a history of depression
with suicidal tendencies.

45
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:26,861
- Sister Peter Marie make this diagnosis?
- In consultation with me.

46
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:29,734
L mean, Zoloft... It's just wasteful.

47
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:33,967
Alvarez is in solitary,
probably for the rest of his life.

48
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:37,308
What's the point
of stuffing pills down his throat?

49
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,682
- The man is no danger to anybody.
- Except himself.

50
01:00:42,818 --> 01:00:45,252
Like l said, he can be self-destructive.

51
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:49,985
As of tomorrow,
l'm taking Alvarez off the antidepressants.

52
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:55,121
Sorry, my hands are tied.

53
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:57,961
When the Governor made this deal,
the contract stipulated...

54
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:01,525
that Weigert was to run the medical side
without any interference from me.

55
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:05,005
Yeah, but, Leo, there's no one you can call?

56
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:07,542
The president of the company?

57
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:10,773
But, see, Weigert
is a subsidiary of Medmore...

58
01:01:10,846 --> 01:01:13,406
which is owned
by a large conglomerate in Berlin...

59
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,916
and <i>mein</i> German is none too good.

60
01:01:16,418 --> 01:01:17,908
So this is it?

61
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:21,818
We just let Miguel Alvarez
sink into depression? Ls that it?

62
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,861
L guess l better get these meds to him
while l still can.

63
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:32,992
Yeah. You better hurry.

64
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:37,632
Listen, Miguel...

65
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:41,069
l want to explain something to you.

66
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:44,975
These pills that l've been giving you...

67
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:47,412
to make you feel better, to calm you down...

68
01:01:49,451 --> 01:01:52,011
l'm not going to bring them anymore.

69
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,920
You're not gonna come see me?

70
01:01:58,127 --> 01:01:59,116
No.

71
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:01,089
Not as often.

72
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:03,131
My grandpa told me this.

73
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,768
What do you mean?

74
01:02:07,403 --> 01:02:12,102
He told me yesterday you weren't going
to come and visit me no more.

75
01:02:13,709 --> 01:02:15,108
Your grandfather?

76
01:02:16,212 --> 01:02:17,543
Yesterday?

77
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:25,083
Miguel, your grandfather's dead.

78
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:28,753
Don't go.

79
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:32,991
L have other patients.

80
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:34,957
Miguel.

81
01:02:38,033 --> 01:02:40,729
You know, I...

82
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:46,468
l liked working in the ward as an orderly.

83
01:02:50,212 --> 01:02:52,203
L liked working with you.

84
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:02,054
You cared.

85
01:03:30,786 --> 01:03:34,449
He told me
that he spoke to his grandfather...

86
01:03:35,624 --> 01:03:36,955
yesterday.

87
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,894
Anyway, Sister Peter Marie
will still be monitoring him.

88
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:47,863
But you and Miguel have had a special
relationship since he first came to Oz.

89
01:03:49,271 --> 01:03:52,297
So we just thought you should know.

90
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:58,404
L appreciate that. L was just about to go over
to solitary to distribute Holy Communion.

91
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:03,507
L know a hundred barrio boys like Miguel.

92
01:04:05,154 --> 01:04:09,557
L watched a lot of them end up in a place
like this. L watched a lot of them die.

93
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:17,664
L'm not sure how much longer l can do this.

94
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:21,597
Thank you.

95
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,030
Miguel?

96
01:04:23,706 --> 01:04:26,072
L came to offer you the Holy Sacrament.

97
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:29,500
L already told you
that l can't go to Communion...

98
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:32,741
'cause before l go to Communion,
l gotta go to confession...

99
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:34,373
and l can't confess.

100
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,439
Why not?

101
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:45,023
Could you leave us alone please?

102
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:51,690
What you tell me is between you and God.
L'm not compelled to tell anyone.

103
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,727
You know, it's the same drill, you know.

104
01:04:56,538 --> 01:05:00,702
L jabber on about how Rivera got blinded...

105
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:03,745
and you tell me that l gotta do what's right.

106
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:07,475
And l gotta rat on everybody else
who was involved?

107
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,945
L won't do that shit.

108
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,511
You won't, or you can't?

109
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:17,788
You took your vows
going into priesthood, right?

110
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:21,757
L took mine going into El Norte.

111
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:30,865
You know, l came to visit your grandfather
in this cell. Or maybe the next one.

112
01:05:30,939 --> 01:05:33,840
This one. And he's still here.

113
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:39,104
We talked about you and Maritza
having a baby.

114
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:43,318
Remember how sad you were
when the baby died?

115
01:05:44,686 --> 01:05:47,018
Them wafers, what are they made out of?

116
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:49,750
Flour.

117
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:53,254
Fuck it. Give me one.

118
01:05:53,595 --> 01:05:55,620
No, l can't give you a wafer. L can't just...

119
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:58,995
Miguel! L said...

120
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:01,662
Don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me.

121
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,571
Why did you do that?

122
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:13,209
What's going on?

123
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:16,948
Not unless you make this a confessional...

124
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:20,785
and you fucking promise me
that you ain't gonna say nothing to nobody.

125
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,084
All right.

126
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:27,526
All right. With what happened
with Rivera, right?

127
01:06:27,996 --> 01:06:32,797
He's a hack. So all the other hacks,
they forget to feed me.

128
01:06:35,304 --> 01:06:37,295
How often do they forget?

129
01:06:39,007 --> 01:06:41,942
L eat about just twice a week.

130
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:46,344
- Shit! Miguel, you have to...
- You promised me.

131
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:51,016
L don't get any water.

132
01:06:53,956 --> 01:06:55,651
So what have you been drinking?

133
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:58,889
Stuff from the toilet.

134
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:01,694
My own piss.

135
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:17,174
- 88P217.
- 96J522.

136
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:19,908
98A498...

137
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:22,280
In Emerald City, you will follow the routine.

138
01:07:22,351 --> 01:07:25,718
We'll tell you when to sleep, when to eat,
when to work, when to shit.

139
01:07:25,787 --> 01:07:29,120
You will follow the rules:
No yelling, no fighting, no fucking.

140
01:07:29,191 --> 01:07:32,649
These are your sponsors.
They will help you get adjusted to life in Oz.

141
01:07:32,728 --> 01:07:35,196
Kareem Said, Hamid Khan...

142
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:38,165
Raoul Hernandez, Carlo Ricardo...

143
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,162
Kenny Wangler, Malcolm Coyle.

144
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:47,706
<i>Prisoner number 99C122, Malcolm Coyle.</i>

145
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:50,367
- Yeah, motherfucker! What?
- Drop it!

146
01:07:54,816 --> 01:07:57,876
<i>Convicted: January 1</i>7<i>, 1999.</i>

147
01:07:58,754 --> 01:08:02,554
Grand larceny, armed robbery,
assault with a deadly weapon...

148
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:04,992
assault of a police officer.

149
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,119
Sentence: 50 years.

150
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:09,893
Up for parole in 20.

151
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:15,227
- Yo, yo, this is my nigger right here, Coyle.
- What's up, man? Call me Snake.

152
01:08:15,837 --> 01:08:18,772
- Yo, yo, Snake.
- All right, Arnold Jackson.

153
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,603
Arnold? Who this, Willis?

154
01:08:20,676 --> 01:08:24,009
Yeah. That the Arnold
formerly known as Poet.

155
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:25,569
L don't write poetry no more.

156
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,514
Even so, partner, you got to
get a better name than Arnold.

157
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:31,485
What the hell are y'all doing,
watching some little kiddy show?

158
01:08:31,553 --> 01:08:34,989
- No, this ain't no regular kiddy show.
- This is <i>Miss Sally's Schoolyard</i>.

159
01:08:36,124 --> 01:08:39,184
<i>Miss Sally's Schoolyard</i>?
Looks like a bunch of stupid puppets.

160
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,489
Wait.

161
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:45,124
Jesus, look at them melons!

162
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:48,131
God, mama! Damn!

163
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:51,601
- Mama!
- Lucky fucking puppets!

164
01:08:52,774 --> 01:08:56,471
- Hey, Wangler.
- What?

165
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:58,643
Mr. Nappa wants to see you.

166
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:02,312
- Nappa.
- Kenny.

167
01:09:02,384 --> 01:09:06,377
No. Bricks. L told you a million times, Bricks.

168
01:09:06,455 --> 01:09:08,047
That Kenny Wangler shit is dead.

169
01:09:08,123 --> 01:09:10,523
- Bricks.
- You show Mr. Nappa some respect.

170
01:09:10,592 --> 01:09:14,323
It's all right, Chucky.
He and l are business partners.

171
01:09:14,396 --> 01:09:16,626
We don't stand on formalities.

172
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:20,996
Tomorrow everybody gets healthy.

173
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,630
So l don't want this Snake
to hear too much about our operation.

174
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:29,905
That's my road, dog.
He all right. He seems all right, at least.

175
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:31,969
"Seems" isn't good enough.

176
01:09:33,315 --> 01:09:36,751
Tell him nothing
until we're sure he's not undercover.

177
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:41,549
- How you wanna be sure of that?
- Put him to a test.

178
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:43,954
A test? What you want me to do?

179
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:48,258
On the corner, don't you have some way
to measure a fellow's loyalty?

180
01:09:49,364 --> 01:09:50,797
Yeah, we got something like that.

181
01:09:57,673 --> 01:09:59,766
All right, stop!

182
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:06,612
Look, motherfucker. Get up, nigger.

183
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:09,511
Look at that.

184
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:11,078
One love.

185
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,651
Yo, he down with us.

186
01:10:23,632 --> 01:10:25,395
Jailhouse confessions.

187
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:28,763
You always gotta take them
with a grain or two of salt.

188
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:32,303
Of course there is the chance
that the inmate doing the confessing...

189
01:10:32,374 --> 01:10:37,141
is actually telling the truth.
But more likely, it's a half-truth.

190
01:10:38,914 --> 01:10:40,677
"Half-truth."

191
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:46,254
How come it's never called a half-lie?

192
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:12,109
- No.
- You used to be so neat and clean.

193
01:11:18,253 --> 01:11:19,515
Come on.

194
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:28,352
<i>Tapiro, he was working psych that night.</i>

195
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,522
L won't hurt you.

196
01:11:29,598 --> 01:11:33,728
<i>He couldn't believe his fucking eyes.</i>
<i>Adebisi protecting Schibetta.</i>

197
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:36,667
<i>And then washing the kid's face.</i>

198
01:11:36,738 --> 01:11:40,401
Go figure that one out, skipper.
Adebisi fucks Schibetta up the ass...

199
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:42,636
and now he's his goddamn
fucking guardian angel?

200
01:11:42,711 --> 01:11:46,738
Yeah, we keep hearing
how Adebisi's a changed man...

201
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:48,476
but l wonder.

202
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,246
Tapiro thinks he's getting out
of the psych ward soon.

203
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:54,212
This could be useful.

204
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:59,784
Simon, l've decided to send you back
into the general population.

205
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:01,852
You think that l'm ready?

206
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:05,363
For the past month
l've reduced your dosage of Xanax...

207
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:08,403
and you haven't demonstrated
any violent behavior.

208
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:11,166
So, yeah, you're ready.

209
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,041
The question is,
do l put you back in Emerald City?

210
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:16,509
L hope, yes.

211
01:12:17,446 --> 01:12:19,505
But if you don't, l understand.

212
01:12:20,348 --> 01:12:22,782
It's because of the trouble l caused.

213
01:12:22,851 --> 01:12:25,718
There are plenty of guys in there
who have issues against you.

214
01:12:25,787 --> 01:12:28,620
L will apologize
to each person that l've hurt...

215
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,384
starting with you, McManus.

216
01:12:33,695 --> 01:12:35,026
L'm sorry.

217
01:12:37,332 --> 01:12:39,800
Apology accepted. Let's go.

218
01:12:45,373 --> 01:12:48,399
- Look, Adebisi's back.
- What's up, Africa?

219
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:51,173
- Is he okay?
- Back from the bush.

220
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:02,614
L thought the road to my salvation
was Africa.

221
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:06,124
But there's nothing pure in Africa.

222
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:09,295
It is backward, diseased, corrupt.

223
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:12,923
L was dancing in circles.

224
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:15,960
L don't want to live in a hut.

225
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:19,240
By taking Jara's life...

226
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:21,908
you saved mine.

227
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:25,176
Thank you.

228
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,542
L'd like to work back in the kitchen, please.

229
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:37,416
Okay.

230
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:42,720
But we have an arrangement with Wangler.
L don't want you selling tits.

231
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:45,995
Trust me...

232
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:49,065
l'm done with drugs.

233
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:00,812
All right, what the fuck?
L know you don't believe him, do you?

234
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:03,316
Maybe l do, maybe l don't.

235
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:07,253
Come on, all that bullshit
about Africa and trust? He's setting us up.

236
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:10,883
- That remains to be seen.
- Fuck that. L'm twisting the shit...

237
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:13,792
No, you don't touch him
unless l give the say-so.

238
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:18,097
- Bullshit! Fuck what you say.
- No, this is not bullshit.

239
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,192
You take a walk.

240
01:14:27,142 --> 01:14:30,976
Skipper, why not let him kill Adebisi?
Lt's no skin off of us.

241
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:34,675
You know, Wangler's very cocky.

242
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:38,715
If our Nigerian friend's
change of heart is real...

243
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:41,981
he could be worth plenty to us alive.

244
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:46,785
Come on, guys, move it. You guys are
moving like a bunch of turtles this morning.

245
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:49,921
- Adebisi, what are you up to?
- Nothing.

246
01:14:49,998 --> 01:14:51,522
This is me you're talking to.

247
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,001
You gonna tell me you're not gonna
get revenge on the wops and Wangler?

248
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:56,162
That's right.

249
01:14:56,237 --> 01:14:58,933
Whatever drugs they had you on
in the psych ward...

250
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:01,066
l hope you brought some to share.

251
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,472
Come on, man, watch where you're going.

252
01:15:06,181 --> 01:15:07,512
Excuse me.

253
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:12,245
He don't look so fucking tough to me.

254
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:37,738
Move it, Adebisi.

255
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:41,179
Okay, boss.

256
01:15:46,154 --> 01:15:49,988
- They changed the name?
- Yeah, catchy. Sign in, please.

257
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:53,753
My father used to work here.

258
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:57,022
Maybe you knew him. Samuel Hughes.

259
01:15:57,465 --> 01:16:00,957
Sammy Hughes, sure. You're Sammy's kid?

260
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:05,368
Your dad, he's still missed.

261
01:16:07,575 --> 01:16:10,408
- Thank you.
- So, what brings you back?

262
01:16:11,212 --> 01:16:14,340
L'm here to see Leo...
The warden, about applying for a job.

263
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:17,217
No. Absolutely not.

264
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:21,316
Why? L completed CO training.
Came in second in my class.

265
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:24,754
- Does your mother know about this?
- I want to surprise her.

266
01:16:24,826 --> 01:16:27,954
You'll surprise her, all right.
You'll give her heart failure.

267
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:29,860
Not if l have your support.

268
01:16:30,331 --> 01:16:34,267
Leo, after Dad died you were always there
for me. Be there for me now.

269
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:37,463
When the hell did you grow up?
Last time l looked, you were seven.

270
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:38,563
Look, Leo...

271
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,701
Clayton, look, l promised your father
l'd watch out for you.

272
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:44,840
L want to be a CO.

273
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:47,606
Like you. Like Dad.

274
01:16:47,682 --> 01:16:49,115
- Clayton...
- Leo...

275
01:16:49,184 --> 01:16:52,017
if you don't hire me, another prison will.

276
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:59,289
L want to welcome you all
to Oswald Correctional.

277
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:03,727
As a Level Four prison, we handle some
of the most dangerous men in the state.

278
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:07,764
L myself stood where you're standing,
30 years ago.

279
01:17:08,269 --> 01:17:12,399
Only, in those days, we were called guards
and we had to wear hats.

280
01:17:13,308 --> 01:17:14,570
Bad hats.

281
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:21,114
The warden back then gave us a piece
of advice that l'd like to pass along to you.

282
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:25,443
"Be aware and beware."

283
01:17:26,387 --> 01:17:30,084
My own little addendum is "Be fair."

284
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,326
Again, welcome.

285
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:40,159
- Some speech.
- What, you didn't like it?

286
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:43,500
Sounds like you said the same thing
100 times before.

287
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:48,270
So where are you assigning me?
Unit B, solitary, death row?

288
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:49,833
Somewhere you'll be safe.

289
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:57,343
L understand that, sir,
but l can't let you in without permission.

290
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:01,184
One second please.
Could you just get into one line?

291
01:18:03,391 --> 01:18:06,121
Just your entire name there.
Thank you very much.

292
01:18:06,194 --> 01:18:07,286
One second.

293
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:08,861
Your entire name.

294
01:18:13,768 --> 01:18:16,066
- You're the new girl.
- Girl?

295
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:18,796
Yeah, you know.

296
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:21,571
L'm Diane Wittlesey.

297
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:23,733
Claire Howell.

298
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:28,513
- How was your first day?
- Uneventful.

299
01:18:30,518 --> 01:18:31,917
That's good.

300
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:35,047
L don't know. L like a little action.

301
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:38,156
Just wait.

302
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:43,121
Speaking of action, who's the cute guy
who's running Emerald City?

303
01:18:43,832 --> 01:18:46,096
- Tim McManus?
- He available?

304
01:18:48,002 --> 01:18:49,902
Yeah, as far as l know.

305
01:18:51,005 --> 01:18:53,769
What, you used to fuck him?

306
01:18:56,244 --> 01:18:58,041
Yeah, actually l did.

307
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:04,676
So, if there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask me.

308
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:08,983
Don't you worry about me, honey.
L can take care of myself.

309
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:13,758
Yes, l'm sure you can.

310
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:21,734
Hi. Claire Howell. We met earlier.

311
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:23,964
- Yeah, hi.
- Working late?

312
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:27,473
No, l'm just finished, as a matter of fact.

313
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,242
Wanna have dinner?

314
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:33,974
Would you like to have dinner with me?

315
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:43,156
Don't tell me you're the kind of guy
who can't handle a woman asking him out.

316
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:47,251
No. As a matter of fact,
l find it kind of ballsy.

317
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:50,220
So, what do you say?

318
01:19:50,298 --> 01:19:53,665
There's a Romanian restaurant
around the corner l've been dying to try.

319
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:54,997
Romanian?

320
01:19:56,771 --> 01:19:58,762
Well, why not?

321
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,066
L'll meet you at the parking lot.

322
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:03,302
Okay.

323
01:20:05,413 --> 01:20:07,210
Now, you see, love...

324
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,141
Love is the ultimate half-truth.

325
01:20:24,332 --> 01:20:25,993
We missed you. Hi.

326
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:31,466
Sit.

327
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:37,233
Where's Mommy?

328
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:41,447
- She couldn't come.
- Yeah, she's got the flu.

329
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:43,450
- She sends her love.
- And this.

330
01:20:43,518 --> 01:20:46,419
- This place is fucked up, man.
- It doesn't look so bad to me.

331
01:20:46,487 --> 01:20:48,011
You're in that special unit, right?

332
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:52,082
Yeah, but it's nice, you know.
Clean. They call it Emerald City.

333
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,152
- They had the riot in there.
- That was, like, two years ago.

334
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:57,094
- Even so...
- Not a word!

335
01:20:58,032 --> 01:20:59,795
He's gonna be fine.

336
01:20:59,867 --> 01:21:03,359
Don't worry about me. Okay?
Don't worry about me.

337
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:11,103
Carlo, you had a good visit
with your family?

338
01:21:11,179 --> 01:21:14,774
- Yeah, they brought these.
- It's good to have family, man.

339
01:21:14,849 --> 01:21:16,316
L don't know.

340
01:21:16,884 --> 01:21:18,647
You don't know what?

341
01:21:19,187 --> 01:21:20,654
L don't know.

342
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:25,381
- You don't know what?
- I don't know what it is to have a family.

343
01:21:25,626 --> 01:21:29,027
Wait. You saying a guy don't need a family?

344
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:31,130
Yeah, l didn't need one.

345
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,327
Got sent to juvie when l was 9 years old
for five years.

346
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:36,393
Got out, got sent back up...

347
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:39,431
till l was about, what, 18.

348
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:42,576
Then l got sent to Lardner, 15 years.

349
01:21:42,643 --> 01:21:45,806
So by the time l got out,
my family was either dead...

350
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,041
gone, or they didn't want
nothing to do with me.

351
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:50,311
You spent your whole life...

352
01:21:51,052 --> 01:21:53,213
You were raised by the system.

353
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:55,278
Guess what, man? L'm proud of it.

354
01:21:55,356 --> 01:21:58,120
- You're proud of it?
- You wanna play? Here.

355
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:04,620
<i>L swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>
<i>and nothing but the truth. So help me God.</i>

356
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:07,997
<i>So help me God.</i>

357
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:15,636
- What do you got there?
- What?

358
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:18,537
That letter you just pocketed. What's in it?

359
01:22:18,746 --> 01:22:20,145
What letter?

360
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:25,947
- I saw you.
- Get glasses, man.

361
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:29,346
- Give it to me.
- Got nothing to give.

362
01:22:29,957 --> 01:22:31,447
Listen, Hoyt...

363
01:22:31,526 --> 01:22:34,086
you wanna start pulling scams in here
behind my back...

364
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:37,893
l'll get you transferred out of here
faster than you can fucking spit.

365
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:47,966
<i>You have to do something for me. For me.</i>

366
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:54,242
Ryan!

367
01:23:02,156 --> 01:23:05,091
Lt's okay.
Did you have that bad dream again?

368
01:23:06,094 --> 01:23:08,585
Yeah? Did you?

369
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:14,757
Lt's okay, come here.

370
01:23:18,139 --> 01:23:20,198
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

371
01:23:34,055 --> 01:23:35,352
Fuck off.

372
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:38,182
It's your job to serve me.

373
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:51,568
What is your problem, man?

374
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:55,439
- Leave me the fuck alone.
- I wish l could. L got potatoes to peel.

375
01:23:58,146 --> 01:24:01,309
L see. This little hissy fit's about Schillinger.

376
01:24:01,382 --> 01:24:04,180
Ain't got a chance to make him pay
for porking your brother?

377
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:05,879
Fuck you, Arnold.

378
01:24:06,687 --> 01:24:11,351
Why don't you throw ground glass
in his food, like you did to Nino Schibetta?

379
01:24:12,426 --> 01:24:13,791
He's still dead.

380
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:18,428
- Adebisi killed Nino.
- Yeah.

381
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:23,136
L'd fucking airhole him but he's always got
the Aryans or the bikers around him.

382
01:24:23,204 --> 01:24:25,195
L just can't get fucking close.

383
01:24:26,474 --> 01:24:27,736
Unless...

384
01:24:29,043 --> 01:24:30,237
Unless.

385
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,471
Who knew? You think like l do.

386
01:24:34,815 --> 01:24:36,407
That's a scary thought.

387
01:24:39,954 --> 01:24:42,616
Hey, Jaz, l need an ask.

388
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:44,614
Don't do asks.

389
01:24:45,092 --> 01:24:47,788
All right, then how about a trade?
Tits for tat?

390
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,090
Talk to me.

391
01:24:49,163 --> 01:24:51,427
This'll get you in deep shit
with Schillinger, man.

392
01:24:51,499 --> 01:24:52,659
Fuck Schillinger.

393
01:24:52,733 --> 01:24:55,395
All right. L got a package
coming in on Thursday.

394
01:24:55,469 --> 01:24:59,132
L need it slid through the X-ray
without Big Brother seeing what's inside.

395
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:00,401
No problem.

396
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:03,475
What, that's it? You don't wanna know
what l'm bringing in?

397
01:25:03,544 --> 01:25:05,034
Your business.

398
01:25:05,346 --> 01:25:08,042
Besides, you'll know
when you scan the box, right?

399
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:09,275
Right.

400
01:25:10,384 --> 01:25:11,942
L cleared it with Hoyt.

401
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:15,887
He'll make sure our package gets through
without anyone knowing, okay?

402
01:25:49,156 --> 01:25:52,319
- Brass knuckles?
- Yeah, they're a birthday gift from my aunt.

403
01:25:52,393 --> 01:25:54,861
L didn't ask her to send them.
She's a fucking nut job.

404
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:56,055
Right.

405
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:59,964
And, Hoyt, when you saw these come up
on the screen, why didn't you tell the CO?

406
01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:02,002
- Didn't see them.
- You didn't see them?

407
01:26:02,069 --> 01:26:05,505
Sitting there looking at the screen
all day, your vision gets blurry.

408
01:26:05,573 --> 01:26:06,835
Yeah, blurry.

409
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:09,309
Good news then.

410
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,701
L'm changing your work assignment.

411
01:26:11,779 --> 01:26:15,112
You're out of the mail room,
and up making ladies' dresses.

412
01:26:15,182 --> 01:26:16,581
And O'Reily...

413
01:26:17,551 --> 01:26:20,520
tell your aunt, next birthday, socks.

414
01:26:21,622 --> 01:26:22,884
Yeah, that's funny.

415
01:26:22,957 --> 01:26:26,791
In the meantime, no gym privileges
for a week. You can both go.

416
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:29,856
- We got off easy.
- Yeah.

417
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,194
No thanks to your pal Vern Schillinger.

418
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:34,530
- Thought you two were jigtime.
- Yeah, me, too.

419
01:26:34,602 --> 01:26:37,264
If l was you, l'd teach that fuck a lesson.

420
01:27:17,078 --> 01:27:20,047
Open the fucking door, motherfuckers!

421
01:27:21,182 --> 01:27:23,707
- You hear what happened in the gym?
- No.

422
01:27:24,418 --> 01:27:26,545
Bikers attacked Schillinger.

423
01:27:26,754 --> 01:27:28,119
Is he dead?

424
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:30,381
Escaped without a scratch.

425
01:27:31,192 --> 01:27:32,853
Damn it. Fuck!

426
01:27:38,332 --> 01:27:40,061
Want some pretzels?

427
01:28:02,356 --> 01:28:05,484
Hi there. L'm Shirley.

428
01:28:06,527 --> 01:28:09,223
Yeah, l know. Shirley Bellinger.

429
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:11,994
Only woman on death row.

430
01:28:13,834 --> 01:28:15,699
Looks like l'm the only man.

431
01:28:16,003 --> 01:28:17,470
Adam and Eve.

432
01:28:18,072 --> 01:28:20,632
No. This ain't no Garden of Eden.

433
01:28:21,742 --> 01:28:23,209
What's your name?

434
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:27,275
Richie. Richie Hanlon.

435
01:28:28,082 --> 01:28:29,640
Who'd you kill?

436
01:28:30,918 --> 01:28:32,112
No one.

437
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:33,584
Me neither.

438
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:36,746
My daughter...

439
01:28:37,458 --> 01:28:41,519
she died in a terrible accident.
L lost control of the car and she drowned.

440
01:28:44,999 --> 01:28:46,261
And you?

441
01:28:47,735 --> 01:28:49,965
L'm a victim of circumstances.

442
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:54,134
You're appealing.

443
01:28:55,209 --> 01:28:56,608
The verdict.

444
01:28:57,278 --> 01:29:00,611
- Sure. You?
- Mine comes up next week.

445
01:29:01,782 --> 01:29:05,274
The lawyer says
judge might overturn on a technicality.

446
01:29:05,786 --> 01:29:07,378
Fingers crossed.

447
01:29:10,558 --> 01:29:11,991
Show me your prick.

448
01:29:13,127 --> 01:29:14,219
What?

449
01:29:14,595 --> 01:29:17,928
You show me your prick,
and l'll show you my pussy.

450
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:21,162
L'm gay.

451
01:29:22,036 --> 01:29:24,596
L don't care if you're Portuguese.

452
01:29:25,272 --> 01:29:28,935
L don't want to die
with never having seen another prick again.

453
01:29:30,244 --> 01:29:32,769
You and me, we're all we've got now.

454
01:29:33,547 --> 01:29:35,447
We have to help each other.

455
01:29:36,717 --> 01:29:40,517
Show me. Please, show me.

456
01:29:42,289 --> 01:29:43,517
Show me.

457
01:29:54,435 --> 01:29:56,596
Stick it through a little farther.

458
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:02,007
Well.

459
01:30:03,577 --> 01:30:07,638
You must have made some boy
very, very happy.

460
01:30:15,689 --> 01:30:18,590
White America believes
a black man is criminal by nature.

461
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:21,719
That's why we're six times
more likely to get sent to prison...

462
01:30:21,795 --> 01:30:24,559
for the very same crime
committed by a white man.

463
01:30:24,632 --> 01:30:28,193
While we are in Oz, we must remember
the most important jihad:

464
01:30:28,402 --> 01:30:29,869
<i>Jihad bin nafs.</i>

465
01:30:30,437 --> 01:30:34,737
That is the battle within, my brother.
The striving inside for purity.

466
01:30:35,709 --> 01:30:37,734
Hamid, you are new to us.

467
01:30:37,945 --> 01:30:40,311
So it is essential that you understand.

468
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:43,912
Violence is only to be used
in the most extreme of circumstances.

469
01:30:43,984 --> 01:30:45,349
Do l make myself clear?

470
01:30:52,326 --> 01:30:54,419
L've read your books, Mr. Said.

471
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:57,429
L know you are resolved
to overthrow the system.

472
01:30:57,498 --> 01:30:59,625
By using the system against itself.

473
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,728
Using their laws to expose our truths.

474
01:31:04,538 --> 01:31:05,971
During the riot...

475
01:31:06,574 --> 01:31:09,702
8 prisoners were killed.
20 more were injured.

476
01:31:14,315 --> 01:31:18,081
The State Commissioner
absolved the Governor of any responsibility.

477
01:31:18,218 --> 01:31:20,652
But since that time,
l have been quietly contacting...

478
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:23,656
the family members
of all the dead inmates...

479
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:27,117
in order to bring a class action suit
against the administration.

480
01:31:27,194 --> 01:31:30,561
Our hope is that the courts will rule
in our favor...

481
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:33,259
declaring the Governor guilty
once and for all.

482
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:36,667
- And you will serve as the lawyer?
- Yes, my brother.

483
01:31:37,071 --> 01:31:40,802
Along with one of the country's
top litigators, one Arnold Zelman.

484
01:31:41,809 --> 01:31:42,969
A Jew?

485
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:45,605
You rein that in.

486
01:31:46,246 --> 01:31:49,647
It's important at times like these
that we remain ecumenical.

487
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:52,648
Besides, l'll be handling
the heart of the case.

488
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:56,951
L must go.

489
01:31:57,858 --> 01:32:00,383
L have a meeting with Scott Ross' sister.

490
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:02,019
Scott Ross? Who's he?

491
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:04,690
He's one of the inmates
that was killed in the riot.

492
01:32:07,635 --> 01:32:09,432
- Miss Ross?
- Yes.

493
01:32:11,038 --> 01:32:12,471
L'm Kareem Said.

494
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,300
Thank you for coming.

495
01:32:23,183 --> 01:32:24,810
L feel terrible.

496
01:32:27,921 --> 01:32:29,786
L never visited Scott here.

497
01:32:30,858 --> 01:32:32,348
Not even once.

498
01:32:32,826 --> 01:32:34,418
Meant to, of course.

499
01:32:35,429 --> 01:32:38,489
Started and stopped
a couple of times, but...

500
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:44,266
You know, Scott and me...

501
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:48,067
we were never close, really.

502
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:51,106
We came from different mamas.

503
01:32:53,113 --> 01:32:54,478
Even so...

504
01:32:57,051 --> 01:32:58,746
he was my brother.

505
01:33:01,088 --> 01:33:02,248
L'm sorry.

506
01:33:03,323 --> 01:33:05,587
L promised myself l wouldn't do this.

507
01:33:09,296 --> 01:33:10,490
Thanks.

508
01:33:12,533 --> 01:33:14,057
L'm sorry. Thank you.

509
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:16,628
No need to apologize, Miss Ross.

510
01:33:17,237 --> 01:33:20,832
This is a horrific place.
You have every right to feel emotional.

511
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:24,477
L got your letter...

512
01:33:25,946 --> 01:33:27,379
about the lawsuit.

513
01:33:28,549 --> 01:33:32,144
- You said the guards used...
- Excessive force.

514
01:33:33,153 --> 01:33:37,214
In other words, they went way beyond
what was necessary to end that riot.

515
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:42,724
Miss Ross, your brother's life
was needlessly lost.

516
01:33:44,631 --> 01:33:46,292
Will you join us?

517
01:33:48,836 --> 01:33:49,860
No.

518
01:33:51,438 --> 01:33:55,465
- No, Miss Ross? May l ask why?
- I grew up with Scott.

519
01:33:57,077 --> 01:34:00,308
He was a mean boy,
and he became a mean man.

520
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:05,717
L don't know much about how things work,
about how...

521
01:34:06,587 --> 01:34:08,077
the other prisoners behave.

522
01:34:08,155 --> 01:34:12,524
My guess is if the guards used excessive
force on Scott, he probably deserved it.

523
01:34:19,867 --> 01:34:22,097
Why are you staring at me like that?

524
01:34:23,537 --> 01:34:24,697
Sorry.

525
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:30,776
Miss Ross, of course
l respect your decision, okay?

526
01:34:31,478 --> 01:34:33,605
But l do hope you will reconsider.

527
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:38,415
This is not just some frivolous lawsuit.
L am trying to stop brutality.

528
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,654
L sure know what it's like
to get treated badly.

529
01:34:50,998 --> 01:34:55,401
Yeah, l can see that you do.

530
01:35:03,243 --> 01:35:05,302
Once again, thank you for coming.

531
01:35:25,632 --> 01:35:29,159
It's called "miscegenation."
Mixing of the races.

532
01:35:30,938 --> 01:35:35,807
That's M-l-S-C-E-G-E-N-A-T-l-O-N.

533
01:35:37,511 --> 01:35:39,536
Did l get that spelling right?

534
01:35:42,749 --> 01:35:47,015
- What exactly are you after, Schillinger?
- It's not about what l'm after, your holiness.

535
01:35:48,388 --> 01:35:53,325
It's you. L saw you in the visiting room
with that piece of trailer-park trash.

536
01:35:53,627 --> 01:35:55,618
That was a business meeting.

537
01:35:55,929 --> 01:35:58,989
What kind of business? Monkey business?

538
01:35:59,566 --> 01:36:03,525
Shit, sorry. Forgot l'm not supposed
to call you people monkeys.

539
01:36:07,574 --> 01:36:09,303
Everybody sit down.

540
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:11,777
Yeah, sit, boys.

541
01:36:11,845 --> 01:36:15,008
Ask your minister how come
he's making goo-goo eyes at a white gal.

542
01:36:15,082 --> 01:36:16,709
That is not true.

543
01:36:18,518 --> 01:36:21,578
Go ahead and deny it. L know what l saw.

544
01:36:42,676 --> 01:36:46,237
There are some confessions
that you can't even make to yourself.

545
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:49,171
Yearnings, desires...

546
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:54,144
that if you admitted to having,
you'd have to stop being who you are.

547
01:36:54,521 --> 01:36:57,081
And the facade you've built so carefully...

548
01:36:57,457 --> 01:37:00,984
would crumble,
exposing to those around you...

549
01:37:01,995 --> 01:37:04,122
what really makes you tweak.

550
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:40,532
Busmalis, move your big, ugly ass.

551
01:37:40,634 --> 01:37:42,431
L'm almost done, sir.

552
01:37:46,073 --> 01:37:49,600
Yeah, perhaps you are.

553
01:37:51,645 --> 01:37:53,442
What are you doing?

554
01:37:53,647 --> 01:37:55,410
How does that feel?

555
01:37:55,816 --> 01:37:59,217
That's how Mark Mack felt
when your tunnel collapsed on him.

556
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:03,950
That's right. L haven't forgotten
that you killed Mark.

557
01:38:04,224 --> 01:38:06,590
L never believed that was an accident.

558
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:08,550
Are you suffocating?

559
01:38:20,907 --> 01:38:22,875
Get him to the hospital.

560
01:38:29,883 --> 01:38:33,216
You want to see me, Rebadow?
Some kind of emergency?

561
01:38:34,354 --> 01:38:36,117
Busmalis. How is he?

562
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:40,892
He's still having trouble breathing.
We've got him hooked to oxygen.

563
01:38:40,961 --> 01:38:42,588
The man's a Nazi.

564
01:38:43,563 --> 01:38:44,655
Busmalis?

565
01:38:44,898 --> 01:38:46,365
Metzger.

566
01:38:51,738 --> 01:38:56,107
- He is tough, l'll give you that.
- McManus, even you can't be so blind.

567
01:38:56,443 --> 01:38:57,671
Even me?

568
01:38:57,978 --> 01:39:01,141
Metzger is one of them,
the Aryan brotherhood.

569
01:39:01,214 --> 01:39:04,706
Since he arrived, too many things
have happened favoring the Aryans.

570
01:39:04,785 --> 01:39:08,949
Robert Sipple crucified, Tobias Beecher
getting his arms and legs broken.

571
01:39:09,022 --> 01:39:10,011
L know.

572
01:39:11,191 --> 01:39:14,558
If you know,
how does Metzger keep his job?

573
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:16,925
He won't for long.

574
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:19,965
L may be blind, but l'm not dumb.

575
01:39:35,949 --> 01:39:39,180
- What's the word on Busmalis?
- Do you really care?

576
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,783
Wouldn't ask if l didn't.

577
01:39:42,055 --> 01:39:44,046
You care, why?

578
01:39:44,191 --> 01:39:47,957
Because you used excessive force,
you're afraid it'll look bad on your record?

579
01:39:48,028 --> 01:39:50,258
L did not use excessive force.

580
01:39:50,464 --> 01:39:52,056
The man almost died.

581
01:39:52,732 --> 01:39:54,222
But he didn't.

582
01:39:54,668 --> 01:39:57,933
Yeah, 'cause you knew
exactly when to let go.

583
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:02,071
What's the motto?
"Choke them till you smell shit"?

584
01:40:06,012 --> 01:40:08,947
- Nice tattoo.
- Souvenir of a misspent youth.

585
01:40:11,384 --> 01:40:14,876
Metzger, l know who you are.

586
01:40:16,456 --> 01:40:18,219
L know what you are.

587
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:21,749
All l am is a highly trained...

588
01:40:21,828 --> 01:40:26,060
underpaid member of the Correctional
Officers Benevolent Association.

589
01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:31,162
But if l am what you think l am...

590
01:40:32,272 --> 01:40:33,967
you should tiptoe.

591
01:40:35,242 --> 01:40:36,641
Is that a threat?

592
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:40,111
L'm merely reminding you
who your friends are.

593
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,944
Remember who you want
standing next to you...

594
01:40:43,016 --> 01:40:46,008
when one of these fucks
comes after you with a knife.

595
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,781
So before Metzger came to town...

596
01:40:48,855 --> 01:40:53,121
he lived in Montana where he was
part of the White Supremacy Warriors.

597
01:40:53,894 --> 01:40:55,361
You sure of this, Tim?

598
01:40:55,428 --> 01:40:58,090
L got a friend who works in the FBI
who verified it.

599
01:40:58,165 --> 01:41:01,259
Even so, you can't fire a man
for what he did 15 years ago.

600
01:41:01,334 --> 01:41:03,734
L need proof that he's in cahoots
with Schillinger...

601
01:41:03,803 --> 01:41:07,534
that he's responsible for what happened
to Busmalis, Beecher and the others.

602
01:41:07,607 --> 01:41:09,768
Nobody will testify against Metzger.

603
01:41:09,843 --> 01:41:12,937
The union's not gonna let us do anything
without evidence.

604
01:41:13,013 --> 01:41:16,915
He's also very popular with the other COs.
L don't need any more morale problems.

605
01:41:16,983 --> 01:41:20,077
So we let him stay on board
till maybe he kills somebody?

606
01:41:20,153 --> 01:41:23,953
- I have no choice.
- Even though he thinks of you as a nigger?

607
01:41:26,126 --> 01:41:28,253
- What did you say?
- A nigger.

608
01:41:29,196 --> 01:41:32,131
If you're trying to piss me off,
you're succeeding.

609
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:36,864
L don't want Metzger in this building
one minute longer than you do.

610
01:41:36,937 --> 01:41:39,929
But if l'm going to take him down,
l'm gonna need ammunition.

611
01:41:40,073 --> 01:41:41,973
All right. L'll see what l can do.

612
01:41:44,744 --> 01:41:46,905
Tobias, it appears
all your bones have healed.

613
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:50,973
L'll keep the brace on for a couple of days,
but l'm sending you back to Em City.

614
01:41:51,051 --> 01:41:54,817
- Use this till you're feeling steady.
- Yeah, that'll come in handy.

615
01:41:54,888 --> 01:41:59,086
- You need to cut those fingernails.
- I will. Soon as l get back to my pod.

616
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:02,890
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi, Gloria.

617
01:42:03,263 --> 01:42:06,721
Listen, l know that Karl Metzger
was at least partially responsible...

618
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,961
for both of your accidents.

619
01:42:11,538 --> 01:42:14,632
Beecher, l want you to testify against him.

620
01:42:15,175 --> 01:42:16,836
You, too, Busmalis.

621
01:42:25,018 --> 01:42:27,179
L don't know what you're talking about.

622
01:42:27,487 --> 01:42:31,218
Yeah, Metzger escorted me to the gym.
Then he left me there.

623
01:42:38,632 --> 01:42:40,156
Then what happened?

624
01:42:40,967 --> 01:42:42,400
L don't remember.

625
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:53,546
You know, the human mind
has a wonderful ability...

626
01:42:54,214 --> 01:42:56,705
to erase the unpleasant parts of life.

627
01:43:12,432 --> 01:43:16,266
- Hello, Tobias.
- Dude was in a fucking body cast, yo.

628
01:43:16,336 --> 01:43:19,328
- Is he okay?
- He's gotta have painkillers.

629
01:43:49,336 --> 01:43:50,564
Beecher.

630
01:43:52,272 --> 01:43:53,364
Yeah.

631
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:57,441
L know there's no reason
for you to believe me, but...

632
01:43:58,111 --> 01:43:59,578
You're sorry?

633
01:44:01,247 --> 01:44:02,373
Yeah.

634
01:44:03,416 --> 01:44:05,907
And you promise you'll never do it again?

635
01:44:09,389 --> 01:44:11,254
Toby, l'm serious.

636
01:44:11,324 --> 01:44:12,586
No doubt.

637
01:44:13,927 --> 01:44:17,294
Three months you were in the hospital,
l had a lot of time to think.

638
01:44:18,465 --> 01:44:19,625
Of me?

639
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:23,059
What l did was wrong.

640
01:44:23,136 --> 01:44:27,630
L've been trying to figure out a way
to prove to you that l'm truly sorry.

641
01:44:29,209 --> 01:44:30,642
And l do love you.

642
01:44:36,449 --> 01:44:38,781
How about l fuck you in the ass?

643
01:44:50,463 --> 01:44:55,025
- How about you break my arm?
- L'm gonna do a shitload more than that.

644
01:44:55,368 --> 01:44:59,236
Break my arm, both my arms. Bend my legs.
Break every fucking bone in my body.

645
01:44:59,305 --> 01:45:01,569
L'm not gonna tell the hacks nothing.

646
01:45:02,275 --> 01:45:04,175
How stupid do you think l am?

647
01:45:06,513 --> 01:45:09,038
You let me break your legs...

648
01:45:12,419 --> 01:45:14,148
and then you snitch on me.

649
01:45:15,522 --> 01:45:16,921
L won't, l swear.

650
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:23,551
Swear, promise, take an oath, make a vow...

651
01:45:25,698 --> 01:45:27,393
then go fuck yourself.

652
01:45:35,942 --> 01:45:38,137
There's gotta be something l can do.

653
01:45:39,546 --> 01:45:40,843
There is.

654
01:45:42,482 --> 01:45:45,815
There is one thing that you can do...

655
01:45:46,085 --> 01:45:48,610
that'll make me believe
that you are truly sorry.

656
01:45:48,688 --> 01:45:49,848
What's that?

657
01:45:55,295 --> 01:45:56,523
Confess.

658
01:45:58,264 --> 01:46:01,825
Tell McManus that you, and Vern,
and Metzger attacked me.

659
01:46:02,735 --> 01:46:05,465
L do that, they're gonna cut off my balls.

660
01:46:06,306 --> 01:46:08,399
Yeah. That's right.

661
01:46:09,576 --> 01:46:12,704
Okay, motherfucker,
what, you want a confession?

662
01:46:14,047 --> 01:46:18,245
You want a confession? Okay, but l'm
leaving Metzger and Schillinger out of it.

663
01:46:18,318 --> 01:46:20,115
Not good enough.

664
01:46:26,459 --> 01:46:28,791
All right, l'll tell McManus everything.

665
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:33,299
- L'll hold my breath.
- Fuck you, you fuck.

666
01:46:34,734 --> 01:46:36,497
L gotta see McManus.

667
01:46:37,403 --> 01:46:40,338
L wanna see McManus.
Just take me to McManus.

668
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:53,110
Beecher, what the hell is going on?

669
01:46:54,454 --> 01:46:55,682
L don't know.

670
01:46:56,923 --> 01:46:59,448
Come with me. Come on.

671
01:47:00,793 --> 01:47:02,522
You don't need it, come on.

672
01:47:11,471 --> 01:47:14,406
Tell me what the fuck is going on.

673
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:17,468
What did you say to Keller?

674
01:47:19,112 --> 01:47:21,410
Why is he going to see McManus?

675
01:47:24,117 --> 01:47:25,550
L don't know.

676
01:47:26,519 --> 01:47:28,510
You know, you cocksucker.

677
01:47:29,455 --> 01:47:30,888
Tell me.

678
01:47:36,162 --> 01:47:37,390
Tell me.

679
01:48:12,332 --> 01:48:14,129
Schillinger, come on.

680
01:48:16,336 --> 01:48:17,667
What's up?

681
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:21,371
McManus and Glynn
wanna have a little chat.

682
01:48:21,874 --> 01:48:23,239
About what?

683
01:48:23,743 --> 01:48:25,938
Your little pal, Keller, confessed.

684
01:48:26,813 --> 01:48:29,509
Put you and Metzger in
for the beating on Beecher.

685
01:48:29,582 --> 01:48:31,573
Horse shit. He'd never do that.

686
01:48:32,485 --> 01:48:35,648
He did. Now the piper's
looking for his paycheck.

687
01:48:36,589 --> 01:48:39,854
- Nice try.
- You fucked up, Vern. You trusted him.

688
01:48:39,926 --> 01:48:42,087
Keller knows if he fucks with me
he's a dead man.

689
01:48:42,161 --> 01:48:44,254
Not if he's in protective custody, sweetheart.

690
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:55,839
<i>Truth is a powerful thing.</i>

691
01:48:57,844 --> 01:49:00,074
<i>It can right a wrong...</i>

692
01:49:02,415 --> 01:49:04,542
<i>or make a bad thing worse.</i>

693
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,517
<i>But in Oz, the truth is...</i>

694
01:49:11,024 --> 01:49:13,515
<i>if the facts don't fit the truth...</i>

695
01:49:15,795 --> 01:49:17,319
<i>fuck the facts.</i>

696
01:49:32,512 --> 01:49:33,877
Lights out!
