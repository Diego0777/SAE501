1
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,558
Oz, the name on the street

2
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,965
for the Oswald
State Correctional Facility

3
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,730
Level Four.

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,638
Oz is filled with murderers,
rapists, racists, drug dealers

5
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,642
with the most common
of criminals.

6
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,270
But what is it
that makes a man common?

7
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,837
Better yet,
what makes him unique?

8
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,248
Winning wars,
winning awards? No.

9
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,946
What lifts a man
out of the ordinary

10
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,478
is who he loves...

11
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,687
and who loves him.

12
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,861
Today this great state of ours
can once again stand proud.

13
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,889
We have the finest,
most modern

14
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,767
correctional facilities
anywhere in the country.

15
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,364
Let the word go forth
to friend and foe alike

16
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,739
that we will spare
no expense,

17
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,074
no time, no effort

18
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,512
in housing
and punishing

19
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,574
the bottom feeders
of our society.

20
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,523
Can I have your
attention, please?

21
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,360
I'd like to welcome you all
to Our Lady of Fatima Parish.

22
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,525
Now I know that due
to the recent renovations

23
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,558
resulting from
the gas explosion,

24
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,570
visits to oz
have been severely limited

25
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,401
and this is gonna be
the first chance

26
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,999
that many of you've had
to visit your family members.

27
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,169
When your name is called,
line up here.

28
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,441
We're walking single file
back to Emerald City.

29
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,040
As you know, today is also
the first visiting day in months.

30
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,813
Many of you are anxious
to be together with your families,

31
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,820
so, the quicker
you follow instructions,

32
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,822
the sooner
you'll be together.

33
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,847
Call the numbers.

34
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,383
#96A214,
Adams, Phillip.

35
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,055
Carrie Schillinger.

36
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,155
Hello, Carrie,
how are you?

37
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,166
- How's Jewel today?
- She's fine, thanks.

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,192
- Eugenia Hill?
- How are you, father?

39
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,205
I'm fine, Mrs. Hill.
How are you today?

40
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,697
Excited to see my son.
It's been way, way too long.

41
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,870
Of course.
Sonsyrea Arif?

42
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,313
- Welcome.
- Salaam alaikum.

43
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,512
- Annette Osorio?
- Right here.

44
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,515
I'm coming.

45
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,546
I'm coming.

46
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,157
You're cute.

47
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,631
Here we go.

48
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,092
- My god.
- Wow!

49
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,573
All right, all right.

50
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,700
- Looks good.
- Looking good.

51
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,207
Oh, God damn.

52
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,439
Wow, check it.

53
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,939
It's bigger,
but not necessarily better.

54
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,041
- I like the new color.
- It's the same color.

55
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,952
- I miss the old place.
- Don't be daft.

56
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,321
All right, Officer Murphy will now
give out your cell assignments.

57
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,384
- I want a room with a view.
- And maid service.

58
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,091
#96A214 Adams, Phillip,
cell number six.

59
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,595
Over the course of history
many famous people

60
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,399
have joined the infamous
in prison,

61
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,565
extraordinary human beings
with noble characters

62
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,336
who for one reason or another
ended up on the wrong side of the law.

63
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,709
Take...
Thomas Paine.

64
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,409
He was arrested for treason,
for fostering rebellion.

65
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,418
Yet without
his fiery writings,

66
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,420
America might never
have been free.

67
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,853
Or Thomas Moore,

68
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,856
the statesman,
scholar and saint

69
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,858
who was sent
to the tower of London

70
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,917
for being honest
with his king.

71
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,953
Moore's reward
was to be beheaded.

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,297
Help! Help me!

73
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,236
Help me! Help!

74
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,670
Help!

75
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,608
"And Samson sayeth
onto his brethren,

76
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,838
now shall I
be blameless

77
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,640
when I do harm
the Philistines."

78
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,413
My friends,
there are times

79
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,422
when we are guilty
for our actions

80
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,447
and should be punished
accordingly.

81
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,461
But there are times
when our actions,

82
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:39,363
however cruel,
leave us blameless...

83
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,663
because we have punished
the guilty.

84
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,261
Amen.

85
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,533
Now let us pray.

86
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,540
Dear Lord,

87
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,906
we ask you to continue
the recovery

88
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,911
of the Reverend
Jeremiah Cloutier,

89
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,073
who survived
the gas explosion...

90
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,977
which in turn
freed him

91
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,148
from the wall he had been
bricked up inside of.

92
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,125
Lord, we ask you to bless
the Reverend's journey today

93
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,128
as he comes back to Oz

94
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,689
from the burn unit
at Benchley Memorial Hospital.

95
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,098
Lord, we also ask you
to bless Jaz Hoyt...

96
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,270
who took
full responsibility

97
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,102
for sealing Reverend Cloutier
in the wall.

98
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,268
Jaz is a good man,
Lord,

99
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,007
who suffers needlessly
in solitary confinement.

100
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,676
Look down upon him, Lord,
keep him strong.

101
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,221
Gloria, has Cloutier
arrived yet?

102
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,057
- Uh, yeah.
- I need to see him.

103
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,563
Hoyt was in charge
of rebuilding that kitchen wall.

104
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,125
So I got him in solitary
but he won't say who else is involved.

105
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,159
So I need
Cloutier to tell me.

106
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,401
He can't, not yet. His throat
was damaged during the fire.

107
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,169
He can hardly make
any sounds at all.

108
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,938
- Is he conscious?
- Occasionally.

109
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,140
Then he can nod his head yes or no
when I read him a list of names.

110
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,375
- Where is he?
- In the private room.

111
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,407
Tim, wait.

112
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,148
He was very badly burned
during the explosion.

113
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,885
The fact that he survived
at all is a miracle.

114
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,483
Hallelujah.

115
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,961
I just want to prepare you
for what you're gonna see.

116
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,402
You have any visitors
coming today?

117
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,075
- Yeah, my sister Annette.
- Nice.

118
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,108
Yeah, she's a great gal.
I love her to death.

119
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,178
She's always been there
for me when I needed her.

120
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,213
She's also
a bit of a head case.

121
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,560
- Got a light?
- No, there's no smoking.

122
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,626
Oh. Scootch over.

123
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,570
I wanna sit down.

124
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,909
I hope you didn't mind
when I got on the bus,

125
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,814
me flirting with you.

126
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,910
No, I just...

127
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,013
Ccause I know how you priests
don't go in for girls.

128
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,889
- You know, actually...
- Oh no, I'm sorry.

129
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,917
That came out wrong.
I mean...

130
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,488
You swear to God
you'll never have sex.

131
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,658
- Uh, well yes, but...
- Do you know my brother?

132
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,497
Sure, he comes to mass
every Sunday.

133
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,199
Enrique?
At mass?

134
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,273
Jesus, he must be
bored out of his mind.

135
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,144
Oh no, I'm so...

136
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,011
That came out wrong.

137
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,678
I'm sure you give
a very cheery service, father.

138
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,687
Only my brother
is not like,

139
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,519
You know,
of the churchgoing variety.

140
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,149
I got to admit
that most of the guys

141
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,592
just come because they want
a break the monotony.

142
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,955
I haven't seen Enrique
in three years.

143
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,024
Been in South Beach.

144
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,036
What were you doing
down there?

145
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,368
Bartending, mostly.

146
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,397
I tried to go for some modeling jobs
'cause I got a good figure,

147
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,275
but, you know,
I wasn't willing

148
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,472
to play the games.
You know what I'm saying?

149
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,276
Yeah, I think I do.

150
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,510
The guys try to take
advantage, huh?

151
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,078
Exactly, which is why I need
to speak to Enrique.

152
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,955
'Cause one certain guy
took too much advantage.

153
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,983
My fucking husband.

154
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,858
He hurt you?

155
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,055
I loved that Cuban cocksucker
with all of my heart

156
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,658
and he cuts
a chunk out of me.

157
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,261
I need Enrique
to talk to Xavier.

158
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,499
To call him from Oz?

159
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,837
My brother's voice
travels far.

160
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,469
He don't need a phone,
if you know what I'm saying.

161
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,378
No, please don't tell
me any more.

162
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,212
You're a priest.
You can't say nothing to nobody.

163
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,445
That's only
during confession.

164
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,421
We're not in a confessional,
we're on a bus.

165
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,650
- Don't get so technical.
- Uh, annette,

166
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,921
What you're about to ask
your brother is wrong.

167
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,723
Bullshit!
Look at my arm.

168
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,060
I didn't say that what
your husband did was right.

169
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,497
I'm just saying that's not
gonna solve the problem.

170
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,501
Fuck you,

171
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,231
you self-righteous
jizzball.

172
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,068
You don't know
dick about dick.

173
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,165
And that came out exactly
the way I meant it.

174
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,588
Listen up.

175
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,793
When I give the order,
you are to walk

176
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,735
from your cell
and form a single line.

177
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,463
Step out.

178
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,646
- All right.
- Hey, what's going on?

179
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,375
No talking.

180
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,957
- Holy shit.
- New and improved.

181
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,982
No talking.

182
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,353
Okay. During the reconstruction
we discovered

183
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,595
that there are problems in the air ducts
throughout the building.

184
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,331
We need to clean out
the ducts in solitary.

185
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,340
And so, until that job
is complete,

186
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,342
I'm going to put you all
back into gen pop.

187
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,606
- Hey.
- There you go. Awesome.

188
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,739
- No talking.
- I didn't say shit.

189
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,750
Now this is a second
chance for you slugs.

190
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,548
If you behave yourself
over the next few days,

191
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,750
You won't have to return
to solitary, understood?

192
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,783
- Don't fuck this opportunity up.
- Warden?

193
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,854
Exactly what is the problem
with the air ducts?

194
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,866
That's none of your
concern, White.

195
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,868
What air duct?
That's the air we breathe, right?

196
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,599
What part of "no talking"
don't you understand?

197
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,437
I've got a constitutional right
to breathe fresh air.

198
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,308
- I mean, fuck a duck.
- Breathe, brother, breathe.

199
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,950
- Where are you going?
- See McManus.

200
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,259
He ain't here.
Get back in line.

201
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,875
Welcome home, Miguel.

202
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,911
I've been hoping
and praying for this day.

203
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,446
We've got unsettled
business, you and me.

204
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,288
- Oh yeah?
- You killed my boys

205
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,227
Carlo Ricardo
and Jorge Vasquez.

206
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,854
You gotta pay.

207
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,759
Spit, sweat, blood.

208
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,930
What?

209
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,805
Bodily fluids, you know.
Fluids the body produces.

210
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,242
Piss and tears.

211
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,371
Some are voluntary,
some not so voluntary.

212
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,314
When I was in my
cubbyhole, you know,

213
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,011
I had a lot of time
to think about my fluids.

214
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,544
My juices, you know.
My shit.

215
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,784
You're fucking nuts,
Alvarez.

216
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,520
That's right. Right.
That's me, I'm fucking nuts.

217
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,729
You say I gotta pay?

218
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,530
Fine, put this on
my tab, okay?

219
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,302
Hey, what the fuck
is going on in here?

220
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,570
- We're taking showers.
- With your clothes on?

221
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,600
Up against the wall.
Come on, move it.

222
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,446
What, me too?

223
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,642
Naw, I can see
you're clean.

224
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,919
All right, confine these
two dinks to their cells.

225
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,923
Put Guerra in the cage.

226
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:55,017
Come on, move it.
Got anything else to say, Alvarez?

227
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,496
Man is 80% water.

228
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,137
Hey, Miguel.
You are one lucky fuck.

229
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,004
Oh, yeah, that's me.

230
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,009
You know,
I'm Mr. Lucky.

231
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,011
You know Guerra
wants you dead

232
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,876
and I can yank him
off your ass.

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,882
If I do what, huh?

234
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,850
If I kill somebody for you?

235
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,852
Those days are gone, chica.

236
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,820
Those days are long gone.

237
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,915
See, I got no interest
in sniffing the butthole.

238
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,984
You won't survive solo.
You ain't got the balls.

239
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,053
- Ain't got what?
- Balls... cojones, pendejo.

240
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,257
- That's what I'm saying.
- Ah, bolitas, right.

241
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,426
You see this?

242
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,330
I did that. Yeah.

243
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,668
Cut my own face,
you know what I'm saying?

244
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,004
I shoved a shank
in Rivera's eyes.

245
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,409
You know what I'm saying?
I slit Vasquez's throat.

246
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,072
You know what I'm saying?

247
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,547
I handle a knife better
than a fucking surgeon.

248
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,244
I got nothing to prove
to you, brother.

249
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,276
Nothing.

250
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,019
Come on, get the fuck
out of my face!

251
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,657
Muévate, muévate,
hombre.

252
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,756
Hey, Giles.

253
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,760
Don't think I've forgotten
about you sticking me.

254
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,533
Little fucking cocksucker.

255
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,666
Yeah!
Yeah!

256
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,615
This incident with Giles
concerns me, Alvarez.

257
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,822
You want to stay out of solitary,
you've got to stay out of trouble.

258
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,296
You and me both know
that I'm going back

259
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,299
to solitary
no matter what I do.

260
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,301
Glynn is not gonna
let me run around free.

261
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,135
And even if you did
convince him to, I'm doomed.

262
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,140
You know?

263
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,734
Attract trouble
like a fucking magnet.

264
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,477
You know what
quicksilver is?

265
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,385
- Quicksilver? Yeah.
- Yeah.

266
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,219
It's like mercury, right?
Stuff they make mirrors with.

267
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,351
Mirrors, yeah.

268
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,091
Reflections, right?

269
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,259
It's just this whole changing mood,
you know what I'm saying?

270
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,996
I mean,
that's just me, man.

271
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,302
It's me, McManus.

272
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,969
You know, I'm just
kind of quicksilver, man.

273
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,480
Whoosh, you know?

274
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,512
Hey, Guerra.

275
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,594
You know, you look
like a fucking gorilla

276
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,120
I seen one time
in the fucking Bronx Zoo.

277
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,565
Fuck you. You better hope
they don't let me out of here soon

278
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,795
'cause your fucking
black ass is mine.

279
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,168
Oooooo!
Hey!

280
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,834
Anybody got a banana
I could feed to the fucking ape?

281
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,343
Omar.

282
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,108
There you are.
I've been waiting to see you.

283
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,939
May I step forward, please?

284
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,212
All right. Yeah.

285
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,221
I know I'm always
saying I'm sorry

286
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,749
for all this nonsense
I keep getting sucked into.

287
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,262
- Kicking you and stabbing you.
- What, man?

288
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,095
When the hacks told me
I was coming back to Em City

289
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,830
I said McManus
is the man, son.

290
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,532
Yo, I mean, he got
a heart as big as...

291
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,168
- I don't know what's as big.
- All right.

292
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,009
- No, wait, I know what I'm saying.
- Don't fucking touch.

293
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,947
Even if I'm not saying
the right words,

294
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,007
I will make good
this time, I promise.

295
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,020
You know, I'm glad that you're willing
to make another effort,

296
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,284
but I gotta ask you
a question.

297
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,291
Why the fuck did you
get so upset with me?

298
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,623
Why did you kick me
in the head?

299
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,220
You know, there I am sitting there
watching TV, right?

300
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,493
And you come up on the screen,
big as day, right?

301
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,899
And Guerra, fucking Guerra,
he starts making fun.

302
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,267
- That's how the fight...
- I know all this shit.

303
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,363
Why did you fucking
attack me?

304
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,443
'Cause you didn't say
nothing to me, man.

305
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,910
About what?

306
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,743
About being a contestant
on fucking "Up Your Ante."

307
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,909
I think I know this.

308
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,478
I mean, here I think
we getting all friendly.

309
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,355
We shared our thoughts
and feelings.

310
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,820
And then I gotta find
out you on TV

311
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,228
the same time as all
the rest of them fucks.

312
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,297
Oh.

313
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,561
As a matter of fact, uh...

314
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,234
you sort of owe me
an apology.

315
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,638
- Me apologize to you?
- Uh-huh.

316
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,376
Work detail.

317
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,246
Go to work, Omar.

318
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,097
Here you go, Burr,
hot and tasty.

319
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,604
- Just the way you like it.
- Appreciate it.

320
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,765
Mericón.

321
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,237
- Stupid fucking spics.
- Don't worry.

322
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,407
You're gonna get your chance
to hack up Chico Guerra soon enough.

323
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,817
That's just the thing of it.

324
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,344
I'm tired.

325
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,789
I don't wanna hack
anybody up anymore.

326
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,189
I'm really, really,
really trying.

327
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,028
I'm trying to keep it
on the straight and narrow.

328
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,398
On the up and up,
you know what I'm saying?

329
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,427
Hey, negro estupido.

330
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,636
Hey, tamale boy,

331
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,837
why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

332
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,675
What?

333
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,739
Guerra's not the gorilla.
You are.

334
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,683
Get the fuck off me,
you black bitch motherfucker.

335
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,624
I'm gonna fucking get you!
Get off me, you bitch.

336
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,020
What did you say
about a banana?

337
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,951
Back in the day
before the day,

338
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,977
explorers would set out on ships
to discover new worlds.

339
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,219
Adventurers like Marco Polo
and Christopher Columbus

340
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,987
would sail
into the horizon

341
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,995
not sure if they'd
find a place to land

342
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,997
or fall off the edge
of the Earth.

343
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,999
As a result
of their journeys,

344
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,001
both Polo and Columbus

345
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,003
got fame, fortune

346
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,267
and a pair of leg irons.

347
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,332
That's right. The man
who discovered America

348
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,538
was a con arrested
for embezzlement.

349
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,547
After a few months
in a dank, dirty dungeon,

350
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,549
I bet old Chris
started wishing

351
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,574
he had fallen off
the edge of the Earth.

352
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,150
Thanks, Father M.

353
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,889
- She is giggling...
- She's excited to see her grandpa.

354
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,023
We had the blood test done.
Hank was definitely the dad.

355
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,694
- I heard.
- Yeah.

356
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,602
I just want Mr. Schillinger
to be there for Jewel.

357
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,334
And we don't have
anyone else.

358
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,832
- What about your parents?
- My folks are back in Montana.

359
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,812
They don't give two shits
about Jewel and me.

360
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,315
Maybe in time, Carrie.

361
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,610
Maybe.

362
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,252
- It's video games.
- I beg your pardon?

363
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,352
Hank played video games
all day and into night.

364
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,659
Video games and videos.

365
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,495
He watched that
"Natural Born Killers" like 60 times.

366
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,094
I just think that, you know,
maybe if he hadn't he'd still be alive.

367
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,105
I don't think
it's that simple, Carrie.

368
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,700
Hank's upbringing,
family life, education,

369
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,143
they all had a lot to do
with making him who he was.

370
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,074
Can you bless my baby, Father?

371
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,643
Can you take away the curse
that's on her head?

372
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,212
Curse?

373
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,224
The one that killed
Hank and his brother.

374
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,226
The one that put
Mr. Schillinger at Oz.

375
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,863
I just want my girl
to be happy, you know.

376
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,388
Have a happy life.

377
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,826
All right,
I'll say a prayer.

378
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,904
Can't wait to see
my granddaughter.

379
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,036
Christ, you gonna get
all mushy again?

380
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,908
Grub, boys.

381
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,144
Fuck you calling boy?

382
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,245
I'm sorry, Schillinger. I know
you're having a rough recovery

383
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,485
and I don't wanna say nothing
to loosen up them sutures.

384
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,653
Hey, what did you do? Serve everybody
else in this fucking prison

385
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,855
and then bring us
the shit leftovers?

386
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,558
Robson, you been
in Oz all this time

387
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,725
and now you want
to be a food critic?

388
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,099
Oh, you're scary, oh.

389
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,565
We got to get back to
Gen Pop or I'm gonna go stir-crazy.

390
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,908
Dr. Nathan says
we're at full speed.

391
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,880
It's time to take
down Kareem Said.

392
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,645
That fucking nigger's
gonna live to regret shanking us.

393
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,657
Them Muslims got what
they call a jihad,

394
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,591
A holy war.

395
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,992
They ain't seen war
like what's coming.

396
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,020
Jihad?

397
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,333
Yee-ha!

398
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,972
You want to go
to the hole?

399
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,667
You can't put
me in the hole.

400
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,539
I'm recuperating.

401
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,977
Health care,
it's a bitch.

402
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,316
Thank you.

403
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,683
Said. Said.

404
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,296
The warden has decided
to charge you with attempted murder

405
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,234
for stabbing Robson
and Schillinger.

406
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,733
- Want to arrange for a public defender?
- No.

407
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,936
- You intend to represent yourself?
- No.

408
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,539
I intent to plead guilty.

409
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,992
Said's in a dark
and ugly place.

410
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,495
Why should he be any different
that anyone else in Oz?

411
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,498
Since he killed Adebisi
I've watched him

412
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,397
becoming more and more
angry, violent.

413
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,833
This thing with Robson
and Schillinger

414
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,167
is just one more piece
in a long decline.

415
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,435
He was defending
Tobias Beecher.

416
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,841
I'm not debating his motives,
Pete, just his methods.

417
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,243
The old Said would have never
resorted to violence,

418
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,248
at least not
as a first step.

419
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,546
I'm releasing Robson
and Schillinger today.

420
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,984
- Oh great.
- Can't you keep them longer?

421
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,386
No, their wounds have healed
and I need the beds.

422
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,914
Give them a little valium, some prozac,
anything that'll keep them calm.

423
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,860
- Why not medicate everybody?
- Okay.

424
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,261
Listen up, I'm not
gonna take any shit

425
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,459
from the Aryans
or the Muslims.

426
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,990
I intend to tell them so.

427
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,266
I want everyone
in the cafeteria at 3:00.

428
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,935
Don't you want
your mail, Kareem?

429
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,580
Hey, Tobias. What do you
think of the office?

430
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,588
It's very snazzy.

431
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,920
- Yeah.
- And they finally upgraded my computer.

432
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,518
I've got 128 megabytes of RAM.

433
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,760
- How is said?
- Seems fine.

434
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,768
There's concern
among the staff

435
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,861
about the Muslims
and Aryans.

436
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,202
For good reason.

437
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,676
In the shower this morning
I had a thought...

438
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,010
about you.

439
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,107
You were thinking about me
while you're naked in the shower?

440
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,983
Oh boy.

441
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,487
You and Said are friends.

442
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,615
And you and Schillinger
were getting along,

443
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,091
at least until he heard
about your possible parole.

444
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,823
What if I could organize
an interaction

445
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,696
between Schillinger,
Said and you?

446
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,926
If you can broker a peace
between these two,

447
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,403
You save a lot of lives.

448
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,771
And, when you're up
for parole again

449
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,776
at the end
of the year...

450
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,371
I'll smell even sweeter.

451
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,540
Yeah.

452
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,313
Imagine that.

453
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,945
Said, Schillinger
and I in a three-way?

454
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,052
No, absolutely not.

455
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,153
- I'm not going anywhere near Said.
- Vern...

456
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,461
My people don't associate
with his kind.

457
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,467
Yet you have
in the past.

458
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,469
Like when you asked
said to represent you

459
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,563
in your conspiracy
to commit murder trial.

460
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,268
- That was different.
- How?

461
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,402
He hadn't shanked me then.

462
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,210
That is exactly why the two of you
have to sit down together

463
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,411
and that's why Tobias Beecher
has to be there.

464
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,817
Vern,

465
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,414
remember when you
came to me

466
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,424
wanting to make sense
of your life

467
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,188
so that you could find
some peace of mind, some happiness?

468
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,391
This is the same.
You'll be able to express

469
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,059
whatever it is you're truly
feeling inside.

470
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,295
What I feel inside...

471
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,606
is rage.

472
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,608
But you're smart
enough to know

473
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,076
that there's
no comfort in rage.

474
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,638
Rage feeds
off the soul

475
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,275
till there is
no soul left.

476
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,750
I call.

477
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,225
- Beecher, I call.
- Huh?

478
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,423
You wanna play cards
or you wanna dick around?

479
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,329
- I'm out.
- All right, good.

480
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,357
- My deal, right?
- Yes.

481
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,768
Something going on, Tobias?

482
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,330
This is Az, Bob.
There's always something going on.

483
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,512
- 216.
- What's that?

484
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,038
Number of days till
my next parole hearing.

485
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,314
Two matches.
Beecher.

486
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,515
I bet two.
Are you in or out?

487
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,082
I am in.

488
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,922
Oh good, uh...

489
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,159
sit down, gentlemen,
sit down.

490
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,430
Sit down.

491
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,735
I spoke to the three
of you individually

492
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,971
to explain what I hope
we can accomplish here.

493
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,309
I know there is a lot
of skepticism on your part

494
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,316
and so I appreciate
you giving this a try.

495
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,147
We must always
chose life over death.

496
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,415
You're the one who shanked
me in the back, pal.

497
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,217
Kareem, Vern, please.
You know the rules.

498
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,224
Each of you will get
a chance to speak.

499
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,317
First, I want to hear
from Tobias.

500
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,792
Yeah.

501
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,857
I do feel a certain
sense of responsibility

502
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,769
about what happened
that day in the library.

503
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,707
You were happy that
my parole got turned down.

504
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:21,143
Given all the shit that's gone on
between us, I can understand that.

505
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,046
And you saw him and Robson
in my face threatening me

506
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,018
and you wanted to help.
And I can appreciate that too.

507
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,076
So...

508
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,146
you were both justified,
you know, mostly...

509
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,490
in the way you behaved.

510
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,494
- Question.
- Go ahead.

511
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,996
Beecher, would I have been
justified shanking Said?

512
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,726
I wouldn't have been
taunting him.

513
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,563
Kareem.

514
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,661
Do you mean, if the circumstances
were reversed

515
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:51,164
- and Said was threatening me?
- Uh-huh.

516
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,109
Yes, I think you'd be justified
in stabbing him.

517
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,044
Horseshit.

518
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,072
Here's why

519
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,483
and you gonna
want to...

520
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,682
have Sister Pete send me to the State
Asylum when you hear this one.

521
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,514
You two are exactly alike.

522
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,253
- What?
- You are crazy.

523
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,285
Listen to him.

524
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,097
You're both
powerful men.

525
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,535
Not only natural
born leaders,

526
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,538
but each of you
has a vision of the world.

527
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,200
And even though those visions
are in direct opposition,

528
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,437
they do share
some things in common.

529
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,536
Like what?

530
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,638
You both believe
in your people,

531
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,207
in the rights
of your people

532
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,277
and the god-given gifts
owed to your people.

533
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,950
You both believe that your
people deserve a full life,

534
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,516
happiness,

535
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,551
security

536
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,460
and...

537
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,324
I don't know, l... l...

538
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,997
I guess that's all
I have to say.

539
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,907
That's good. That's...
that's enough for today.

540
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,070
I think we should think
about what Tobias said

541
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,240
and, uh, come back
tomorrow.

542
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,842
Officer.

543
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,458
Rapists, pedophiles,
male hustlers...

544
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,585
We got all kinds
of men in Oz.

545
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,118
Men who've turned sex
into a crime.

546
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,758
And for that they belong
in the deepest recesses of our hell.

547
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,769
But as we also know,
sex is not necessarily love

548
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,771
and there are times
when love itself

549
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,239
will get you incarcerated.

550
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,242
Like oscar wilde,

551
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,244
who loved

552
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,542
and lost two years
of his life

553
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,210
sitting in Reading Jail.

554
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,152
Two lips, maybe
a little tongue

555
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,883
pressed against
two other lips.

556
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,756
A simple kiss

557
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,784
can be more lethal
that a gun.

558
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,369
Addiction is satan's tool,

559
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,234
his evil system
to keep our people down.

560
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,466
He supplies the drugs
to our men and women

561
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,873
and then arrests
them for using.

562
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,139
He locks our sons
and daughters in his prisons

563
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,113
and then walks away,
a smile across his white face.

564
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,742
Mrs. Arif? I hate to...

565
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,184
some of the other passengers
on board have asked me

566
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,244
to ask you if you
could keep your voice down.

567
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,122
Why? Because they don't
wanna hear the truth?

568
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,127
The drug policy
in this country

569
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,129
is excessive, oppressive
and racist.

570
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,825
- Be that as it may...
- Instead of locking young black men

571
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,857
behind bars we ought to implement
substance abuse treatment

572
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,029
which is less expensive
and more productive.

573
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,370
- I agree, but now is not the time.
- When is the time?

574
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,308
Did you know that the number
of inmates in american prisons

575
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,311
has more than tripled
in the last 20 years?

576
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,438
- Yes.
- Did you know

577
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,281
that if the inmate population
continues to grow exponentially

578
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,946
by the year 2053
the United States

579
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,922
will have more people
in prison than out?

580
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,447
So, I ask you, Father,

581
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,586
how long do we wait
to change the way things are?

582
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,561
Her baby's trying
to sleep.

583
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,236
Your husband's
a drug addict?

584
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,334
He was, until he found Allah.

585
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,245
My son Augustus,
he was too.

586
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,047
70% of those arrested test positive
for substance abuse.

587
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,076
- Mrs. Arif...
- Sonsyrea.

588
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,089
Sonsyrea...

589
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,650
Your head's all crammed
with facts and figures.

590
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,127
But a cold hard fact

591
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,926
is never as good
as the simple truth.

592
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,058
Your husband,

593
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,333
did he hurt you and your children
while he was addicted?

594
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,298
Yeah.
He became a thief.

595
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:49,109
- And now?
- He struggled and he struggled

596
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,945
and he fought
his cravings.

597
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,884
With the help of Allah
he is clean.

598
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,888
- And your children?
- They miss their father.

599
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,857
- But they have allah now.
- Then, girl,

600
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,328
that's the story
you ought to be telling.

601
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,354
That's the stuff
people need to hear.

602
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,102
- You're in a good mood today.
- Yeah, man, my wife's coming to see me.

603
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,106
All right.
Is she bringing the children?

604
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,473
No, Sonsyrea and I need
some time, just the two of us.

605
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,172
O'Reily.
That man is an animal.

606
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,076
He murdered Patrick Keenan
with such brutality

607
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,312
Every time I see him
I wonder how he lives with himself.

608
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,547
How you doing,
Busmilla?

609
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,882
Eat up, Arif.
Move it.

610
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,852
Hey, take over here
for a second.

611
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,887
Where the fuck
is you goin', man?

612
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,461
- Hey, hey, hey.
- O'Reily, relax.

613
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,470
I haven't seen your brother
since he checked out

614
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,472
of protective custody.
We're just catching up.

615
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,667
I don't want you
anywhere near him.

616
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,539
But Ryan, I like Henry.

617
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,410
- I told you, this guy's a scumbag.
- It takes one to know one.

618
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,643
You on some kind of a kamikaze
mission, Stanton, huh?

619
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,652
If I see you talking to Cyril again
you're going down in flames.

620
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,481
Later.

621
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,224
- What'd you say to him?
- Nothing.

622
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,322
Nothing.

623
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,560
- Jeez.
- Hey, you mick fucks.

624
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,092
We're working over here.
You want to join us?

625
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,702
You know I agonize and agonize
over telling you

626
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,975
I saw Ryan O'Reily
murder Patrick Keenan.

627
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,881
Finally Minister Said convinced
me to step forward and yet,

628
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,851
O'Reily's
never been charged.

629
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,876
That's because I haven't
been able to gather

630
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,889
any concrete evidence
against him.

631
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,687
At this point, all I have
is your testimony

632
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,489
and you won't even
speak publicly.

633
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,495
Or have you changed
your mind?

634
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,963
If I do, O'Reily
will have me killed.

635
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,967
Don't expect miracles.

636
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,231
I've been going over and over
that moment in my mind,

637
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,467
trying to remember every detail
and this might not be important,

638
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,600
But I think I saw O'Reily
pull a shamrock off of Keenan's neck.

639
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,074
- A shamrock?
- Yeah, a gold shamrock on a chain.

640
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,346
- I see.
- Don't let this lie, warden.

641
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,478
Justice must be done.

642
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,613
O'Reily
must be punished.

643
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,553
- Stay back.
- But I've got a pain.

644
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,959
- Where?
- In my heart.

645
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,429
I'm heartsick
'cause you keep ignoring me.

646
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,523
I'm busy, Ryan.

647
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,830
I just wanted to know,
did the medical board...

648
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,308
did they rule on your
case of malpractice?

649
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,478
Yes.

650
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,846
They reprimanded me,
fined me,

651
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,113
but I'm
still a doctor.

652
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,986
Well, that's...
that's great, right?

653
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,320
Gloria?

654
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,919
- May I see you?
- Sure.

655
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,321
Let's walk.

656
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,137
Whoever killed
Patrick Keenan

657
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,233
Took a gold chain from around
his neck, a shamrock.

658
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,244
At one point,
when we spoke,

659
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,508
you had a shamrock
in your hand.

660
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:13,005
- It was his.
- Where did you get it?

661
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,486
Arrived one day at my office
in an unmarked envelope.

662
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,488
When I interviewed you
about the murder

663
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,490
why didn't you tell me
you had evidence?

664
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,153
Leo, I was raped.

665
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,096
After a trauma like that,
you're not always thinking clearly.

666
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,123
There are things I've done
since that night that make no sense.

667
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,264
Just when I think I get
my feelings under control

668
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,968
the slightest thing
sets me off.

669
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,669
I know.

670
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,905
And I am sorry.

671
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:45,382
Honestly, there's a part of me
that's happy Keenan's dead.

672
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,384
I just want to put
his face behind me.

673
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,716
Of course.
Um, Gloria...

674
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,482
One last question
and I promise

675
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,324
I'll never bring it up again.

676
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,023
Where's the necklace?

677
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,400
Here.

678
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,869
I threw the fucking
thing away.

679
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,144
Come on, Warden,
there's got to be a rule

680
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,410
about the number of times you can
keep on asking me the same questions.

681
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,009
You think I'm screwing
with your civil rights?

682
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,019
You want to consult
an attorney?

683
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,079
I don't need an attorney,
'cause I didn't kill Keenan.

684
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,353
Look, man, check
the assignment records.

685
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,656
I wasn't near
the gym all day.

686
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,390
- My informant says different.
- Your informant's a liar.

687
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,695
Why would he lie?

688
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,861
Look, a lot of people
got issues with me.

689
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,871
A lot of people
had issues with Keenan.

690
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,533
The killer was a scrapper,
he was in fights all the time.

691
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,509
You go through the files,
you'll find a shitload of suspects.

692
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,579
I have.

693
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,582
You're still the nearest
and the dearest.

694
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,611
Take him out.

695
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,851
Glynn wants to nail you
for Keenan's murder, huh?

696
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,658
He's got some witness, only I
don't know who. If I could find out

697
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,257
this fucker's name I'd persuade him
to change his testimony or...

698
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,428
- Kill him?
- Yeah, well.

699
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,802
In any case, I need
to confuse the situation.

700
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,136
Yeah, but how?

701
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,635
This clipping...

702
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,373
it needs to find it's way
into Henry Stanton's trunk

703
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,472
buried beneath
his underwear.

704
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,813
Meanwhile, what are you
gonna be doing?

705
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,911
Encouraging an entirely different
eyewitness to step forward.

706
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,654
Go, Marty, go.

707
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,853
- Go! Go!
- Come on!

708
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,623
Yeah, baby.

709
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,892
- Out!
- What the fuck are you talking about?

710
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,991
You are out!

711
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,009
Prisoner #99M633:

712
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,980
Martin Montgomery:

713
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,916
Convicted March 16th, 1999:

714
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,647
Two counts of assault
in the first degree:

715
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,985
Sentence: Eight years:

716
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,617
Up for parole in five.

717
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,759
Hey, Marty my boy.

718
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,427
- How about another piece of cake?
- Sure. Thanks.

719
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,630
- O'Reily, right?
- That's right.

720
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,502
How come you offering
me extra cake?

721
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,067
I've been here almost three years,
you never even farted in my direction.

722
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,078
Well, you're right.
We're not friends.

723
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,979
Everybody knows we're not friends,
which is why I can offer you

724
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,506
- an exciting moneymaking opportunity.
- Which is what?

725
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,577
I want you to go to the warden
and tell him

726
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,815
You saw Henry Stanton
murder Patrick Keenan.

727
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,346
But I didn't.

728
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:44,191
Marty, there's a lot more
cake where that came from.

729
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,964
Stanton caught Keenan
with a barbell

730
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,694
right about here.

731
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,568
Keenan went down. Stanton ripped
the necklace from his throat.

732
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,937
- What happened next?
- I ran.

733
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,033
I mean, what,
stick around?

734
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,342
All right, thanks
for coming forward.

735
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,181
Like I said, my conscience
couldn't take the strain

736
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,844
of keeping
what I saw inside.

737
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,857
I'll be damned.

738
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,655
Normally nobody rats
on anybody,

739
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,491
now I got
two different witnesses

740
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,623
Identifying two different
suspects for the same murder.

741
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,759
Montgomery had a lot more
details than Arif. Specific details.

742
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,498
Yeah, and according
to the records

743
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,473
Stanton and Keenan
were constantly fighting.

744
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,479
- But why would arif lie?
- Ask him.

745
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,778
No, first I'm gonna have
a word with Henry Stanton.

746
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,578
Me?
Kill Patrick Keenan?

747
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,025
- I wish.
- At least twice in unit B

748
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,528
Keenan kicked
the shit out of you.

749
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,292
That ain't true.
I got my licks in.

750
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,129
Medical report...

751
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,364
says after the first fight
you had two broken ribs,

752
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,304
the second one
a broken wrist.

753
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,240
Keenan had no
injuries at all.

754
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,266
Mine was
a moral victory.

755
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,244
That day in the gym,
you whacked him, didn't you?

756
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,648
No.

757
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,745
I swear on my children, no.

758
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,524
We found this
in your cell.

759
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,186
I've never even
seen this before.

760
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,753
You're obsessed
with Dr. Nathan, aren't you?

761
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,789
No. I mean,
she's got nice tits and all,

762
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,631
- but other than that I never even...
- Take him to the hole.

763
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,638
- The hole? Why?
- Maybe a few days there

764
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,333
will jostle
your membrane.

765
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,671
Fuck you, fuck you!

766
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,280
Fuck you!
Fuck you, you motherfucker.

767
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,541
Warden, how's
the investigation going?

768
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:53,454
- Fine.
- When are you gonna charge O'Reily?

769
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,458
Let me ask you something, Arif.

770
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,222
Why are you so hell bent
on Ryan O'Reily going down?

771
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,789
As I said,
justice must be done.

772
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,290
- There's no other reason, no agenda?
- No.

773
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:08,202
This isn't payback
for some wrong done to you?

774
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,969
- No.
- I've been digging around.

775
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,273
During the riots,
you and O'Reily almost came to blows.

776
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,769
- The riot?
- That was five years ago.

777
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:21,774
In my experience
cons have long memories.

778
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,379
You think I made
the story up?

779
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,618
You know what?
At this point, I don't know.

780
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,525
And I'm beginning to wonder
if I even care.

781
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,871
Ready for this?
Glynn's suspended

782
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,930
The investigation
in the murder of Patrick Keenan.

783
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,465
Too many suspects,
not enough clues.

784
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,740
- Perfect.
- Bet you could press it.

785
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,770
Bet you could get
Stanton convicted.

786
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,044
- Don't want to.
- Why?

787
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,607
Look.

788
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,449
Henry Stanton gets the death penalty
for Keenan's murder,

789
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,854
Gloria Nathan's not gonna
let an innocent man die.

790
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,017
She's gonna feel compelled
to tell the truth.

791
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,893
No, I win by keeping
the ball in play,

792
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,159
by keeping
the facts murky.

793
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,902
Have that placed
in Marty Montgomery's cell.

794
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,030
- Montgomery? Why montgomery?
- Life insurance.

795
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,778
Ryan, can I tell Henry
about our secret?

796
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,042
That we fooled
the warden?

797
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,708
No, Cyril.
For Christ's sake,

798
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,684
Don't say a fucking
word to him.

799
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,983
Stop yelling.

800
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,320
Why do you always yell?
Like Papa.

801
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,151
Fuck off.

802
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,024
Galileo Galilei
challenged the principle

803
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,297
that had been accepted
for over 1,000 years

804
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,497
that the Earth
was the center of the universe,

805
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,407
that everything
revolved around us.

806
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,343
The mad monks in the inquisition
imprisoned Galileo

807
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,542
And ordered him to repudiate
his theory. Which he did.

808
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,107
How much worse
of a punishment is there

809
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,882
than being forced to publicly
deny your deepest beliefs?

810
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,186
To say that what you
know to be true

811
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,028
is a lie?

812
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,881
I see that baby over there
and I can't help but think

813
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,645
about Augustus
when he was just born,

814
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,483
when he took
his first step.

815
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,890
You know,
you think back and say,

816
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,324
if I had done this
or if that hadn't happened

817
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,454
his whole life
might have been different.

818
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,932
- Allah guides our every step.
- I know.

819
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,935
God is my rock,

820
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,530
but he can't stop the thoughts
from flooding my head,

821
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,405
the memories
from flowing.

822
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,376
Augustus' first shoes,

823
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,140
his first day of school.

824
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,176
Oh, his wedding day.

825
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,810
He looked so happy.

826
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,820
He and Annabella both did.

827
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,822
The sun was shining
so bright,

828
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,950
I had to squint my eyes
as they drove away.

829
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:20,692
And now I feel
like I lost him that day,

830
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,722
an more ways than one.

831
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,660
His... his world
got narrower,

832
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,434
you know, with the drugs and all.

833
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:35,104
- Is he still using?
- Oh no, thank God.

834
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,444
My boy's been clean
over three years.

835
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,942
- I'm very proud of him for that.
- Yes, indeed.

836
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,977
That's why I'm worried.

837
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,590
That's why today
is going to be so hard.

838
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:53,790
L... I've got news
to tell him.

839
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,093
Bad news.

840
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,569
News that I want him
to hear from me first,

841
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,231
because maybe
if I can just

842
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,968
cushion the blow, he...

843
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,999
he won't go back
to the crack.

844
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,844
His wife, Annabella,

845
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,319
- she's divorcing him.
- Oh, my.

846
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,722
I tried talking
to the girl, but...

847
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,389
her mind's made up.

848
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:31,060
She's got another
fella and now...

849
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,092
she wants to be free.

850
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,500
And yet...

851
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,509
God help me,

852
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,376
I can't stop blaming her

853
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,779
for the darkness
in Augustus' life.

854
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,945
She was with him

855
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,855
the night he shot
the policeman,

856
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,257
the night his spine
got snapped.

857
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,194
She should have taken
better care of my son.

858
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,637
Eugenia?

859
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,735
I'm fine.

860
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,978
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

861
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,948
The tears are for Augustus,
my little emperor.

862
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:31,159
Locked in a cell,

863
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,185
down in that
wretched place,

864
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,523
half his body dead.

865
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,737
And damn...

866
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,275
all I keep thinking of

867
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:54,079
is his first step.

868
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,853
Yo, Burr, how come
you never get in line?

869
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,585
Because ain't nobody
sending me nothing.

870
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:06,391
See this?
Motherfuckers want me

871
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,230
To donate money
to the United Negro College Fund.

872
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,258
They got be be kidding.

873
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,629
Fuck.

874
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,869
It's a letter
from some lawyer.

875
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,002
My wife's divorcing me.

876
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,242
Oh, this is a surprise?

877
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,411
No, I guess not.
I mean...

878
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,581
No, no, I mean,
she...

879
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,920
she's been visiting me
less and less and you know,

880
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,949
when she does come,
there's...

881
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,193
definitely a distance.

882
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,822
What do you expect?

883
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,665
You've been cooped up here in Oz
for the last seven years.

884
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,762
That's a long time for a young gal
to keep a candle lit.

885
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,330
I know.
It's just that...

886
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,400
You know,
we loved each other.

887
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,345
The least Annabella could have
done was come and say goodbye.

888
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,610
It's tough luck,
Augustus, man.

889
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,640
Tough fucking luck.

890
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,418
You'll survive, son.

891
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,755
You survived this shithole,
you'll survive a divorce.

892
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,025
Maybe.

893
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,728
Losing her...

894
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,828
it's like giving up
my last piece of hope.

895
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,508
It's like admitting to myself
that everything I had out there

896
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,376
is gone.

897
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,539
Just gone forever.

898
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,078
You know, I never
told you this, but...

899
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,155
Dee and I was fixing
to divorce too.

900
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,386
- What?
- Just before she got sick.

901
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,820
'Course after she got sick
I couldn't leave her.

902
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,593
I thought you and Dee
was happy.

903
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,794
You always
seemed so happy.

904
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,769
That was the vodka.

905
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,567
The only woman I knew
that could drink more liquor than me.

906
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,804
That love in her eyes
was always a little bit blurry.

907
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,075
No, you and your moms

908
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,378
was the only real family
I ever knew.

909
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,452
She's coming today.

910
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,547
Eugenia.

911
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,581
Maybe you and me
can visit mom together.

912
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,689
You know,
I'd like that.

913
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,760
I'd like to see Eugenia.

914
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,142
She always had
the sweetest pair of eyes.

915
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,430
Okay, it looks
like we're gonna be

916
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,160
at the main gate of Oswald
in about five minutes.

917
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,319
Sonsyrea Arif,

918
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,330
Charles Ballace,

919
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,525
Eugenia Hill...

920
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,537
Annette Osorio,

921
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,540
Sharon Patel,

922
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,906
Trudy Granser,

923
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,877
Carrie Schillinger...

924
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,710
What about
my granddaughter?

925
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:22,013
- Jewel schillinger.
- She's at Benchley Memorial

926
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,919
in stable condition.

927
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:28,412
Dee Swanson,

928
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,484
Pamela Turton...

929
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,986
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
lots of fine people

930
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,727
have sat staring
at the inside of prison walls.

931
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,600
Socrates, Gandhi,
Joan of Arc,

932
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:44,129
Even our Lord
Jesus Christ.

933
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,234
He spent the last night
of his life not with holy men,

934
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,838
but with scum like the kind
we've got in Oz.

935
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,144
One of the last things
Jesus did on earth

936
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,051
was invite a prisoner
to join him in heaven.

937
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,155
He loved that criminal.

938
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,159
I say, he loved that criminal

939
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,525
as much as he loved anyone.

940
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,531
Jesus knew in his heart

941
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,261
it takes a lot
to love a sinner.

942
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,863
But the sinner,
he needs it all the more.
