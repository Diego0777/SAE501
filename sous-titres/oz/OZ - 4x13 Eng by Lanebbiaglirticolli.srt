1
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:38,841
A blizzard is coming, y'all.

2
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,177
Heaps and heaps of snow
will fall from the sky

3
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:44,809
and bury everything--
sidewalks, cars, houses.

4
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:48,514
The ground will grow frozen
and slippery, dangerous.

5
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:52,184
But here in Oz, we're oblivious
to the weather outside.

6
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:57,094
Here in Oz, we're all
toasty, cozy and warm.

7
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,410
Fuck.

8
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:20,812
Cyril?
Hey, you okay?

9
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,947
My hair
is changing back.

10
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:29,719
Oh, shit.
Look at that.

11
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:34,164
And my skin.
l'm not wrinkled.

12
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:37,496
Let's go, let's go.

13
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,072
Well, none of the other
nine prisoners

14
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:50,344
show any long-term or adverse effects
when taking the drug.

15
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:53,546
Since we've stopped testing, their
bodies have been reverting to normal.

16
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,612
Oh, thank God.

17
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,089
- Morning.
- Morning.

18
00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:00,058
- Coffee ready?
- Yeah.

19
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:03,153
Great.
Hope we're not running low.

20
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,255
Weather Channel says
a big storm's a-brewing.

21
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:09,928
With our luck, we'll get
snowed in with no java.

22
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,870
Any word
on how McManus is doing?

23
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,465
Yeah. l stopped by the hospital
on the way here.

24
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:16,533
He's in
great spirits.

25
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:19,170
Doctor says he's doing well,
and he should be back next week.

26
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,042
Good.

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,514
Wow, great news
all around.

28
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,893
Dr. Nathan?
Jeffrey Sykes.

29
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,157
What can l do for you,
Mr. Sykes?

30
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,665
l'm an attorney at
Downing, McNally & Dima.

31
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,758
The Wygert Corporation
has retained my firm

32
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:45,635
to handle all the litigation
regarding the so-called aging pill.

33
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,572
Litigation?

34
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,474
The family of the prisoner
who died, Fred Wick,

35
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,274
is suing
for $25 million.

36
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,611
You're named
as a co-defendant.

37
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,446
- Wait, l am?
- Relax.

38
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,645
l'm confident that the Wicks
will settle out of court.

39
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,746
The more serious problem
is the State Medical Board of Ethics,

40
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,485
a decidedly
less predictable group.

41
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,755
They want to hold
a hearing to determine

42
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:10,354
if there was any malpractice
on your part during the drug testing.

43
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,195
You mean...

44
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,531
Yes, you could lose
your medical license.

45
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:31,475
Dr. Nathan, is it true
you're being forced to resign?

46
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,647
- Dr. Nathan--
- ls it true you didn't follow protocol?

47
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,924
15 inches of snow
over the next three days.

48
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:46,399
With temperatures below zero
and winds at 30 miles per hour,

49
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,401
the morning commute...

50
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:53,168
O'Reily,
you got a visitor.

51
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,470
- Who?
- l don't know. Some broad.

52
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,096
Who are you?

53
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,624
- My name is Suzanne Fitzgerald.
- Do we know each other?

54
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:25,035
Yes, but we haven't seen each other
since you were a very small child.

55
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,268
Look, lady,
l'm not real big on nostalgia,

56
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:30,503
so what
do you want?

57
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:33,512
Ryan, l came because l have
something to tell you,

58
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:36,515
and it's something l think you're
gonna find impossible to understand.

59
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,414
Try me.

60
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:41,284
l'm your mother.

61
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:48,789
- My mother's dead.
- No, l'm your real mother.

62
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,796
The woman that you
thought was your--

63
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,821
My mother's dead!

64
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,745
Well, finally!

65
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,187
Jesus.
Damn it.

66
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,656
l feel like you've been in there
since Halloween.

67
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,887
Hey, l got a lot
on my mind.

68
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,987
Like l give a shit.

69
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,158
You know, Howell,
you are such a cunt.

70
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,828
Look at us arguing
like an old married couple.

71
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,962
You know, O'Reily,

72
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,973
that's the problem--

73
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,066
the thrill is gone.

74
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:39,408
Meaning what?
What, we're through?

75
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:42,677
Yep. Time for me to move on
to greener pastures.

76
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,981
Oh, l'm just
heartbroken.

77
00:06:56,863 --> 00:07:00,060
About time.
l'm starving.

78
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,068
Alvin, all you do
all day is eat.

79
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,535
So what?

80
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,767
l'm supposed to preserve
my girlish figure?

81
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:09,070
Hughes, food's here.

82
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:10,133
Fuck you!

83
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:16,978
Hello there,
Blondie.

84
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,946
You afraid of me?

85
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,922
You don't need
to be afraid of me.

86
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,687
l'm good friends
with your brother.

87
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:29,991
l'd like to be good friends
with you, too.

88
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,965
You can't
do that to me!

89
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:39,665
Get off me!
No!

90
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:46,944
Officer Howell says that your brother,
without provocation, hit her.

91
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,108
- She's a lying cunt.
- ln any event, l've sedated him.

92
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,310
He'll sleep
in the ward tonight.

93
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,342
We seem to be coming back
to the same problem.

94
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:57,015
- l'm not sure what else we can do.
- l don't understand.

95
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,047
We're thinking Cyril should
be transferred to the Conley lnstitute.

96
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:02,323
The insane asylum?
Uh-uh. No fucking way.

97
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,557
We won't decide anything
until McManus gets back.

98
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,827
John, take him
out of here!

99
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,029
Gloria, don't let them do this.
You know he won't survive in there.

100
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,060
Gloria, l'm serious!

101
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,735
- Hey, Dad.
- lt's snowing like a motherfucker.

102
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,145
They say we'll get maybe
15 inches by Thursday.

103
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,980
l appreciate you
making the effort.

104
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,986
What's wrong?

105
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,854
The hacks are talking about sending
Cyril away to the state loony farm.

106
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,620
- So?
- So?

107
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,322
So if he goes to that shithole
by himself then he's gone forever.

108
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,956
What's the difference?
This shithole, that shithole.

109
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:40,932
Yeah, but at least
here in Oz, he's got me.

110
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:44,266
And you've been such a force
for good in his life, huh?

111
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,670
Fuck you.

112
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:49,641
That's my boy.
You didn't call me about Cyril.

113
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,769
You got some other
nonsense going.

114
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:55,303
Now out with it, because l want
to get back before the roads get worse.

115
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:57,407
Suzanne Fitzgerald.

116
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,354
She came to see me.
She says she's my real mother.

117
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,621
She's a lying cunt, a miserable
lying cunt! You hear me?

118
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,357
- Fuck! lt's true.
- l got to go.

119
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:14,059
lt's true, isn't it, Dad?
lt's true!

120
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,369
A son's obligation
is to protect his mother,

121
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:23,500
no matter from whom,
even his own father.

122
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,568
The woman who l thought
was my mother,

123
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,706
l knew she never loved me.
Now l see why.

124
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,648
And Suzanne Fitzgerald?

125
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:34,278
l think she's my mom.
Only l chased her out,

126
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,311
and l have no idea
how to reach her.

127
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:38,756
Well, maybe
l can find her.

128
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,656
Would you?
Would you do that for me?

129
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,890
And this bullshit about
sending Cyril away,

130
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,989
you'll take care
of that, too?

131
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:50,799
Ryan, l can't make any promises.
This isn't my decision.

132
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:55,103
But you'll plead
my case, right?

133
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,938
- Ryan...
- Please.

134
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:59,570
Don't let them
separate us.

135
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,546
Ryan?

136
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,615
- Hey, how you doing, champ?
- Better.

137
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:08,109
You all right?
l know you'll do what's right.

138
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,494
- So how are you getting along, Clayton?
- l'm fine.

139
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,164
- The men in your block, who are they?
- They're cops.

140
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,264
One was
an undercover narc,

141
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:31,766
- the other some yokel from mid-state.
- So at least you're safe.

142
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:34,245
You've got to stop
worrying about me.

143
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,214
l'm not a little boy
anymore.

144
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,410
l know that.

145
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,750
My entire life, you and Leo treated me
like l was some fragile piece of china,

146
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:45,121
afraid l'd break
at the slightest touch,

147
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:48,423
because Dad was stupid enough to get
shanked when l was seven years old.

148
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,658
Clayton, don't speak
that way of your father.

149
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:54,633
All l'm saying is you were
too protective of me.

150
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,728
You'd rather what?
That l let you run with the gangs?

151
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,739
Yes. At least then

152
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,764
it wouldn't have taken me
this long to find my balls.

153
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,300
Oh, and you found them
by shooting at the governor?

154
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:08,974
For the first time,
l know who l am,

155
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,744
my true self,

156
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,251
the thing
l was born to do.

157
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:16,744
l can change
the world.

158
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,384
But tucked away in Unit J
l can't do anything...

159
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:24,697
at least not yet.

160
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,722
What do you mean,
''not yet''?

161
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,597
Clayton, what
are you planning?

162
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,339
Nothing.

163
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,400
Don't worry.

164
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,343
Mail!

165
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:54,782
Hmm, another letter
from your wife, Basil.

166
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,796
She sounds
worse and worse.

167
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,491
l think you ought
to let her come visit.

168
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:01,796
Always grateful
for your input, Robson.

169
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,768
My pleasure.

170
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,771
A couple of magazines
for you--

171
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,966
''Newsweek,''

172
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,373
''Field and Stream,''
''Swank.''

173
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,436
l like my reading
to be well-rounded.

174
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,141
Check out the pussy
on page 15.

175
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:21,647
Oh, hey, nothing
for you today, tough guy.

176
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,247
Bite me.

177
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,487
- Where?
- Fucking cocksucking piece of shit!

178
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:31,224
Christ, not again.
Take off, Robson, now!

179
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,698
Yes, sir.
Bye-bye, baby.

180
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,201
Fuck you, you
fucking dickless Nazi fag!

181
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:40,103
Clayton, if you keep this up,
l'm going to have to spank you.

182
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,766
Careful, he might
enjoy it.

183
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:45,642
- Fucking cocksucker!
- Put Hughes in his cell!

184
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:48,374
Fucker!
Fuck it!

185
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:51,145
Uncuff me!

186
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:53,948
First, you got to learn
not to run with scissors!

187
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,191
We've got to do something
about Hughes, Alvin.

188
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,493
We've tried being friendly.
Now we've got to do something else.

189
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,999
Like what,
boil him in oil?

190
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,002
We should talk
to the warden,

191
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:11,663
have Hughes transferred
to Solitary.

192
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,798
That guy's like
a son to Glynn.

193
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:18,504
Would you put
your son in Solitary?

194
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,071
My son.

195
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,958
You got to--

196
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,426
here, let me
show you.

197
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,925
Thanks.

198
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,196
John, come on in.

199
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,898
Office looks great.

200
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,032
Oh, l hope you're not here to ask
for a new microwave.

201
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,009
Clayton Hughes.

202
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,908
Look, l've been meaning
to come down to J

203
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:57,780
to talk to Clayton.
l just been so goddamn busy.

204
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,086
How's your wife?

205
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,750
She's okay.
How's yours?

206
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,896
l haven't seen Abby
since my trial.

207
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,625
Why not?

208
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:17,660
l'm too...
mortified.

209
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:20,900
John,

210
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,841
look, l'm the last one

211
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,071
to be counseling
on marriage.

212
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,842
But trust me, you don't want
to push her away.

213
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,872
You push
once too often,

214
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,545
and she won't be there
when you need her.

215
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,796
Abby?

216
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,860
please come...

217
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,065
and soon.

218
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:59,302
?? Oh, the weather outside
is frightful ??

219
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:02,337
?? But the fire
is so delightful ??

220
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:06,147
?? And since
we've no place to go ??

221
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:09,916
?? Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow. ??

222
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,890
?? Let it snow... ??

223
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:14,085
lt's cold in here.
You guys cold?

224
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,650
Put on a fucking sweater.

225
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,866
When is Busmalis
getting married?

226
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,095
- Tomorrow.
- That's what l thought.

227
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,262
Shouldn't we
be doing something?

228
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,102
- Like what?
- l don't know.

229
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,973
- A bachelor party.
- A bachelor party here in Oz?

230
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,808
Bachelor parties
are one part alcohol,

231
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,474
one part strippers.
We're in short supply of both.

232
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:40,281
Okay, fine.
l just thought

233
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,150
tomorrow's a big day
for Busmalis--

234
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:45,783
forget
l brought it up.

235
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:50,727
- He misses Keller.
- l don't.

236
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,458
So, Rebadow,
you're the best man, huh?

237
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,060
This marriage
is doomed.

238
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,127
Let's go, Cyril.
Come on.

239
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,212
Just think,
by nightfall tomorrow,

240
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,838
l'll be an old
married man.

241
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,281
You don't think
l am, do you?

242
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:15,686
- Am what?
- Too old to get married.

243
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,656
No.

244
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:21,319
You don't think
l'm crazy doing this, do you?

245
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,954
You got to be a little crazy
to tie the knot,

246
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:25,987
But it's
a good crazy.

247
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:29,627
Sure.
But like you said when l first told you.

248
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,696
How's it going to be,
her outside, me inside?

249
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,708
l mean, we can't even
consummate the vows.

250
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:40,405
l've been saving this
as a surprise.

251
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,142
l've arranged with Sister Pete
for you and Norma

252
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:46,117
to have use, on the evening
of your nuptials only,

253
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,143
of one of the old
hospitality suites.

254
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,757
But conjugal visits
aren't allowed anymore.

255
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,487
Sister Pete
pulled a string or two.

256
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Wow.

257
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,826
Norma and l are going to ''romp
through Cupid's grove.''

258
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,391
- There's only one thing.
- What's that?

259
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:05,631
You're going to have to
tell me what to do

260
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,037
with Norma in bed.

261
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,573
You see, l'm a virgin.

262
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:18,682
O'Reily's right.
This marriage is doomed.

263
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,492
l'm sure she'll be here
any minute.

264
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:31,018
Yep, any minute.
Any second.

265
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,658
- She's not that late.
- No, 45 minutes is not late late.

266
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,634
lt's fashionably late.

267
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,830
Plus, l'm sure that
with snow flurries,

268
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,499
the traffic's--
it's just got to be snarled.

269
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,337
The snow flurries.
Of course.

270
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,435
She might have even gotten
a flat tire.

271
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,742
Or a faulty
carburetor.

272
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,078
She told me she's been hearing
a strange ping in her engine.

273
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,107
Well, see,
there you go.

274
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,478
Pete, did you reach her?

275
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,921
l called Norma's home
and got the voice mail.

276
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,448
So l called the studio where they make
''Miss Sally's Schoolyard,''

277
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,984
and a very nice man
there said,

278
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,518
that he hadn't seen her
all day.

279
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:07,760
My sweetie took off
from work to marry me.

280
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,461
l'm sure she'll be here
any minute.

281
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:11,231
Right.

282
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,137
But with the snow...

283
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,004
Pete, we've been there.

284
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,407
Aha.

285
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,808
Well, you look very nice.

286
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:26,341
Thanks.
This is the happiest day of my life.

287
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:34,185
Are you sure you want
to convert to Catholicism?

288
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,751
Yes, Father.

289
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:38,923
l don't want you
or anyone else to think

290
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,591
that l'm rushing you
into this decision.

291
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:44,262
Does it matter what
anyone else thinks?

292
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:48,103
Father, l know in my heart that
l want to be baptized a Roman Catholic.

293
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,199
The Reverend Cloutier--

294
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:53,302
l no longer care what
the Reverend Cloutier says or does.

295
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,281
Okay.

296
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,083
All right, Samuel,
we'll have the ceremony

297
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,088
next Saturday.

298
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:06,057
Thank you, Father.

299
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,651
Thank you, Samuel.

300
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,094
So Daniel was taken up
out of the den,

301
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,497
and no manner of hurt
was found upon him,

302
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:18,492
because he believed
in his god.

303
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,596
And the king

304
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,738
commanded that--

305
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,179
they brought those men
which had accused Daniel,

306
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:32,446
and cast them
into the den of lions.

307
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,554
Reverend?

308
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,286
Yes, Father?

309
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,294
l hope you're not upset
that Samuel Gougeon

310
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,852
has decided to become
a Catholic.

311
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:48,731
Well, if by upset you
mean angry, no.

312
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,361
But l am fearful
for his soul.

313
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:55,339
His soul will be fine,
believe me.

314
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:58,400
Believing--
that's the bottom line, isn't it?

315
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,940
You are one cool customer,
l will give you that.

316
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,451
Well, how would you
have me behave,

317
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:09,545
red-faced with anger,
gripped by jealousy?

318
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:12,148
No, that's your game.

319
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,751
My game?

320
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:18,661
When Timmy here left your church
to join mine,

321
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:23,066
you started keeping a tally--
whoever saves the most souls wins.

322
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,229
That is not true.

323
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:28,365
l think that your head hasn't accepted
what your heart already knows.

324
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,400
You're baptizing Samuel Gougeon
to get back at me.

325
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,456
Robson,

326
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,959
l need you to take care
of a little something for me.

327
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:50,461
- You got cash?
- Uh-huh.

328
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,487
Start talking.

329
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,295
- The patient's name is Samuel Gougeon.
- What happened?

330
00:20:57,336 --> 00:21:00,066
He's been severely beaten,
possible head trauma.

331
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,733
- l need you to get me some combines.
- Right away.

332
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,175
Okay, turn to me.
Let me see.

333
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,444
How could you?

334
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:14,816
How could you have
Samuel Gougeon beaten?

335
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,083
Mukada, l would never
do such a thing.

336
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,886
What has happened to Samuel,
it's anathema to me.

337
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,052
Are you saying this
attack is a coincidence?

338
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:24,995
l pray that it is.
But if not,

339
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,021
and a member of my congregation
is responsible,

340
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,364
- he will be punished.
- Yeah. Well, do me a favor,

341
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:31,596
leave the punishment to me.
You understand?

342
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,901
Of course.

343
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:50,744
Tim, tell me the truth.
Tell me if you are involved.

344
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,256
Yes.
Yes, l am.

345
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,226
Why? Why would you
have him beaten?

346
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,319
Matthew 26:24,

347
00:21:57,363 --> 00:22:00,161
''Woe onto that man by whom
the Son of Man has betrayed.

348
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,326
lt had been good for that man if he
had not been born.''

349
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,359
You told us
those very words.

350
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:06,371
But you are misconstruing
their meaning.

351
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,374
Gougeon had to be punished
for turning his back on the Lord.

352
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:24,884
l just wanted to give you
the schedule that l worked out

353
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:27,585
clearing the cafeteria
for Ramadan.

354
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,594
You came just to give me
the schedule?

355
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,721
Yes.

356
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:34,426
And there's
nothing else?

357
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:43,702
l made an assumption
about the Reverend Cloutier--

358
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,836
- that he was a phony.
- But he's not.

359
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,972
This all started when Timmy Kirk
decided to convert.

360
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,073
l thought that Kirk
should be celebrating Christ

361
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,880
through the
one true church.

362
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,252
But if he finds his bliss
somewhere else,

363
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,224
should l fight to keep
his soul in my corner,

364
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,352
believing as l do,

365
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:06,421
that the faith
that he's choosing is wrong?

366
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:11,061
Or should l just be happy
that he's found God's love,

367
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:13,094
no matter where?

368
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:17,973
The prophet says,
''Let there be no compulsion in religion.

369
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,478
Each soul journeys alone.''

370
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:25,606
So you must lead
and you must follow.

371
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:28,119
That's impossible.

372
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:32,580
lf serving Allah were easy,
everybody would.

373
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,922
Reverend,
l've been thinking,

374
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:41,160
this might be a good time
for an ecumenical service.

375
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,397
Extraordinary. l was thinking
exactly the same thing.

376
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:48,964
Father, l accused you
of being consumed with envy.

377
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,373
l was.

378
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,776
But l was, too.

379
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,178
Our sins
are our bond.

380
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,615
The house of God
has many rooms.

381
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:04,622
lf a person chooses to move
from one room to another,

382
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:08,023
we who are left behind

383
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,654
must rest assured
the room that we're in

384
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:13,358
is not empty.

385
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:15,628
God's presence
fills every room.

386
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:19,125
God's love shines
through the entire house.

387
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,739
Let us pray.

388
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:31,314
Currier & lves,
Norman Rockwell--

389
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,944
they created images
of America in winter--

390
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,318
ice skating on a lake,

391
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,516
sleigh rides
along a country road,

392
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:43,517
fluffy white crystals
of newfallen snow.

393
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,860
Maybe there was a time
when life was idyllic

394
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:49,299
and children didn't go to school
and kill other children.

395
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:53,395
We see the paintings now
and we grow nostalgic,

396
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,999
nostalgic for a place
we've never seen.

397
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:01,172
We long for a time
that we've never actually been part of.

398
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:08,909
l feel like l've hit
rock bottom,

399
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:12,913
another trapdoor opens
and l plunge further into despair.

400
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,449
God only gives us as much suffering
as we can endure.

401
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:18,122
You mean he piles on the shit
to see if we'll break?

402
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:20,654
- Why?
- To test our faith,

403
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,758
and to make us appreciate
the good that we do have.

404
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:24,826
Well, forgive me
for saying so, Reverend,

405
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,338
- but God is a sick fuck.
- Vern,

406
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,533
Hank's wife, Carrie,
is about to show up.

407
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:34,706
She's been to see me regular
since the day Hank disappeared,

408
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,874
since the day she told me
l'm going to be a grandpa.

409
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,476
Every visit l tell her,
''Don't worry,

410
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,011
Hank'll be home soon.''

411
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:47,924
Well, now l get to tell her that he's
coming home tomorrow in a box.

412
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:05,844
Here she is.

413
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,438
Hi.

414
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,573
Oh, l'm sorry
l'm late.

415
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,107
l had to scrape ice off the windshield
all by myself.

416
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,521
You feeling okay?

417
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,649
l'm feeling fat.

418
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,420
What does
the doctor say?

419
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,587
That l might deliver
earlier than my due date.

420
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,290
Carrie, l got some news,

421
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,426
and it's not good.

422
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,699
But l need you
to be strong,

423
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,228
for the sake
of the baby.

424
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:37,333
- Okay?
- All right.

425
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:43,207
Hank...
was killed.

426
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,645
H-he's dead?

427
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:52,156
Yes.

428
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,385
Fuck--

429
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:58,055
oh, fuck.

430
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,256
Jesus, no!

431
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:02,859
No, no, no!

432
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,062
No, no, no!
No! No!

433
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:09,733
Oh, God.

434
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,505
- lt's going to be okay.
- lt's not going to be okay!

435
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:15,240
How's it going to be okay?
You tell me, huh?

436
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,681
How am l going to live with a baby
and no fucking husband?

437
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:21,880
Oh, God.
Fuck!

438
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,413
Oh, God!

439
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:26,822
- What's the matter?
- l don't know.

440
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:29,156
Get a goddamned
doctor down here fast!

441
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,389
Central, this is 41.
We need a 68 in the visiting room.

442
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,625
Oh, fuck! Ow!

443
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,360
- Carrie--
- lt fucking hurts!

444
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:39,893
Come on, Carrie, keep breathing.
Remember your breathing.

445
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,031
- Just pant. Keep breathing.
- lt's not coming out.

446
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:43,632
lt's coming out.
l can see the head.

447
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:45,506
On three, l need you
to give a big push. Okay?

448
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:49,139
One, two, three,
push!

449
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:51,342
Fuck, it hurts!

450
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,283
- Keep pushing.
- Fuck you!

451
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:56,151
l can see the head, Carrie.
l can see the head.

452
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,156
Oh, here it comes.
Here it comes.

453
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,255
There you go.

454
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,087
No. No. No!

455
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:42,697
Please get off of me.
No. No!

456
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:54,610
Prisoner 01G359,

457
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,238
Colonel Edward Galson;

458
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,808
Convicted
February 16th, 2001 ;

459
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,978
Rape, assault.

460
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,318
Sentence: 15 years,

461
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,824
up for parole in seven.

462
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:08,826
This is
Tobias Beecher.

463
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,351
He's going to help you acclimate
yourself to your new life.

464
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,455
Beecher, this is
Edward Galson.

465
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:16,194
- Hey.
- Which way?

466
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,759
This way.

467
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,275
So l saw a thing
about you on the news.

468
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,846
You raped a fellow officer
at a military convention?

469
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,824
l've been in the Marine Corps
since l was 16,

470
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,451
and l have lived
by its code of ethics.

471
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,054
One night,
l failed that code

472
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:47,691
and l'm being
properly punished.

473
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:52,066
Well, you may not feel that way
after a couple of days in Oz.

474
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:54,766
l'm used to being
in the company of men.

475
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:58,071
l'm used to
a strict regimen.

476
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,544
l won't have
any trouble adapting.

477
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,111
Okay, then.

478
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,190
Do you like
to be called Ed,

479
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:17,855
Edward, Eddie?

480
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,126
Actually,
l prefer ''Colonel.''

481
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,628
All right, Colonel.

482
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:25,863
You want to tell us
about your addiction?

483
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:29,635
l don't think it's an addiction, really.
l don't drink that often.

484
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:34,373
l see. But when you drink too much,
what happens?

485
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:38,746
This one time l lost control.
lt won't happen again.

486
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:41,217
That's easy to say.
lt's harder to do.

487
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:44,450
For a weak man, yes.

488
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:47,549
Okay, yeah, l was weak,

489
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:50,959
and for more than one time.
l probably still am a weakling,

490
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,396
but at least l've got
the balls to admit it.

491
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:56,093
That's enough, Tobias.

492
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:58,898
Okay, everybody.
See you next week.

493
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:10,838
John Carpenter, in fact,
playing for $100,000.

494
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:12,873
- John, welcome.
- Thank you.

495
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:15,318
Well, we've got
somebody here to help you,

496
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,321
whose character
''Miles Silverberg''

497
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,789
in the sitcom
''Murphy Brown''...

498
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:23,055
Hmph-- ''Murphy Brown,''
funny show.

499
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:25,187
Ladies and gentlemen,
Grant Shaud. Grant, welcome.

500
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,360
- l loved Candice Bergen's tits, man.
- The other girl was cute.

501
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:32,427
Lily Tomlin?

502
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,495
And the question is:

503
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,440
What country has the most number
of people who speak English?

504
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,705
America!

505
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:41,905
No, England, dummy.

506
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:44,177
...the good ol' US of A,
but for $100,000 it--

507
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:46,741
it can't be that simple.

508
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,050
- Grant?
- My hint is this:

509
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,546
''Redbook'' gave this country
a rave review.

510
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:57,050
- China.
- l didn't know that.

511
00:31:57,095 --> 00:32:00,724
l'm a big believer
in fake TV newsmen, Gordon.

512
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:02,562
So l'm going to have to go
with China.

513
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,967
Well, John, it may not
surprise you

514
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:07,301
that more Chinese people
than Americans

515
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:11,537
will understand when l say,
you've won $100,000.

516
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:13,407
Fucking Beecher
always gets the answers.

517
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,709
Maybe you should
go on the show.

518
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:19,478
Yeah, right.
''Hey, l'm Tobias Beecher.

519
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,508
l'm in prison
for killing a child.

520
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:23,987
Okay, let's play
'Up Your Ante.'''

521
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,563
Tobias, l'd like you to meet
Katherine McClain.

522
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:35,725
- Hello.
- Hello.

523
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,962
She's a lawyer with the Alliance
for Prisoners' Rights,

524
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:41,336
and she'd like to discuss something
with you. Come in and sit down.

525
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:53,217
Mr. Beecher, are you aware
that you're up for parole?

526
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:56,846
Well, when l was sentenced,

527
00:32:56,888 --> 00:33:00,483
l knew l had to serve
minimally four years.

528
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,493
But all things considered,
l figured my record

529
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,087
would pretty much cancel out any chance
of getting released early.

530
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,533
Well, you may be right.
But l've reviewed your case,

531
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,003
and l think the extenuating
circumstances--

532
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:15,563
l mean, the death of both
your wife and son;

533
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:18,405
your daughter,
her genuine need for you;

534
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:22,402
your improved behavior
over the past six months;

535
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:25,007
the commendations from
Sister Peter Marie and Dr. Nathan--

536
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,816
might motivate the parole board
to look kindly on you.

537
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:33,688
They'll let you go free.

538
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:39,363
l--

539
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,064
Tobias?

540
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,530
l'm okay.

541
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:55,340
- What do l have to do?
- Give me permission,

542
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,348
and l'll set the wheels
in motion.

543
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,680
ln the meantime,
keep out of trouble.

544
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,684
l hear you're a faggot.

545
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,958
Whether l am or not,
what's it to you?

546
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:16,358
Lights go out, l don't
want you getting any ideas.

547
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:20,728
Trust me, Colonel,
l'm never going to get that horny.

548
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:23,900
As long as we
understand each other.

549
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,773
Fucking faggots
are ruining the military.

550
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,906
''Don't ask,
don't tell,'' my ass.

551
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,711
l agree.

552
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,514
You know, l think the military should
stay the way it's always been,

553
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:37,783
a bunch of redneck he-men
who murder children and rape women.

554
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:42,451
You making
a joke of me?

555
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,792
lt seems like you're doing
a pretty good on your own.

556
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:48,288
You son of a--

557
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,833
Wait.
Fuck, no.

558
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,532
Guards-- shit.
Wait, you don't understand.

559
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:56,369
Wait.
Look, l'm sorry.

560
00:34:56,408 --> 00:35:00,344
Will you just fucking let me
explain, you fucks!?

561
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:08,613
God fucking--

562
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:11,144
Fuck!
God damn it!

563
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,022
Fuck!

564
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:22,166
Fahrenheit and Celsius,

565
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,691
two ways of measuring
the same thing.

566
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:26,567
Of course, most of the world
is on Celsius,

567
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:28,572
but we Americans remain

568
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:32,007
defiantly committed
to Fahrenheit.

569
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:35,479
We'd like to learn the other way--
we'd like to change.

570
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,913
But we just can't seem
to accept

571
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:42,113
that zero degrees is actually
warmer than we think.

572
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,217
So, Jackson,

573
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:50,125
why were you sent
to prison?

574
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:52,129
The file's right
in front of you.

575
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,597
You don't want to say
the words?

576
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:59,330
- Assault.
- What else?

577
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,703
This is bullshit.

578
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:06,101
lt's not easy
to verbalize, is it?

579
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:09,675
- So?
- So that's good.

580
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,012
That means you're not proud
of what you did.

581
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,848
No, it means l didn't do
what the bitch says l did.

582
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:18,287
l didn't try to rape her.
She came on willingly.

583
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,857
Okay, l want to schedule you
for another appointment tomorrow.

584
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,863
Why? This shit
is not helping me.

585
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:28,627
Well, it's helping me.

586
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,533
You see, Jackson,
l have quotas to fill.

587
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,130
And l have to see a certain
amount of prisoners every day

588
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,505
or the State
just won't pay me.

589
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,547
Jackson, you were
tested for drugs

590
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:47,574
just before the parole hearing,
and you came out clean.

591
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,053
Do l need to have you
tested again?

592
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:52,249
Nah.

593
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,451
l believe you...

594
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:57,818
for now.

595
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,471
Hey, Redding,
l got a complaint.

596
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,501
The shit Poet sold me yesterday
been cut with something.

597
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,571
Shit, l can't even
get my usual high.

598
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:19,276
The problem ain't with the product,
nigga, it's with the consumer.

599
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:22,582
Am l talking to you?
Yo, l need some better shit.

600
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,716
What Poet's trying to tell you
in his own surly style

601
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,591
is that you've been
snorting so much every day,

602
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:32,562
combined with the size
of your body,

603
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,464
you've developed
yourself a tolerance.

604
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,627
At least he's tolerant
about something.

605
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:40,229
Shut up!
Look, give me some more.

606
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:42,796
More is only going
to kill you.

607
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:48,437
No, you need
a better way to--

608
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,117
- what's that word?
- lngest.

609
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:56,382
lngest.

610
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,155
Only be careful
where you stick it.

611
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,866
You don't want to be leaving
yourself any marks.

612
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,234
- So what, in my tongue?
- Or behind your knee.

613
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:22,937
Lights out!

614
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:56,176
Number 17 Jackson Vahue.

615
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:03,613
As a basketball player,
my legs are what made me.

616
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:07,250
l know l'm never going to see
another pro game,

617
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,623
so fuck it, right?
What's it matter?

618
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,657
But it does matter.

619
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,559
These legs took me out
of the projects.

620
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,000
l made something
out of myself.

621
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,942
l don't want
to forget that.

622
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:33,273
l'm proud of these legs.

623
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:39,213
What's up, fool?

624
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,958
Prisoner number 01D251,

625
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,969
Carlton Daniels,
aka ''Tug'' Daniels;

626
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:55,097
Convicted
February 20th, 2001 ;

627
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,130
Attempted murder
in the first degree.

628
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:59,143
Sentence: 28 years,

629
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:01,475
up for parole in 14.

630
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:09,248
The time for action
has arrived.

631
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:11,812
Tug,

632
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,450
you waste Pancamo.

633
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,517
Done.

634
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:19,029
l want Morales.

635
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:21,031
Why are you so hell-bent
on killing him?

636
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:23,363
l made a promise

637
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:26,700
to avenge the death
of Bian Yixue.

638
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:29,298
Augustus, l want you
to get word

639
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,934
to Omar White
in the hospital ward

640
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:36,413
that he's to finish off
Supreme Allah.

641
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:12,716
Hey, Burr, listen,

642
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,709
l've been thinking
about this little war we activating.

643
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:20,747
A lot of good men
will die.

644
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,760
A lot of them going
to die in any case.

645
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,854
But assuming you win,
what you gonna gain?

646
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:28,661
The hacks will lock down
this whole prison.

647
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:31,065
Can't keep a lid
on it forever.

648
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:33,002
Warden finds out
you're the ringleader,

649
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,062
he going to send you
to Solitary.

650
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,107
Augustus, what the fuck's
your problem?

651
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,546
You were my father's
best friend, right?

652
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:47,073
You and him went off to Vietnam
together, and you came back alone.

653
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,552
And since then,
l have followed you.

654
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,987
l have done your bidding,
never questioning, right?

655
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:54,287
So now you've got
questions.

656
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:57,556
When l was 10 years old,
l wanted a real job.

657
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:59,893
- You wanted a paper route.
- Right.

658
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,491
But instead,
you had me selling smack.

659
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,593
- Well, you got to learn the business.
- Why?

660
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:08,104
Why did l need to learn
how to sell drugs?

661
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:11,666
Because we didn't have
any other options back then.

662
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,677
Let me tell you
something.

663
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:16,043
l ain't going to apologize
for who l am or what l done,

664
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,072
all right?

665
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:22,449
Do l wish things
had been better? Sure.

666
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,977
Do l wish we'd been born
in one of them fancy mansions

667
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:28,185
up there on Kellogg Boulevard?
Sure.

668
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:32,162
But l don't hope
and l don't dream.

669
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:35,063
l take a shit
in this world,

670
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,364
l see reality
and l make the best of it.

671
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,408
You ain't got to tell me
about reality.

672
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,774
l live in Oz.

673
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:50,838
l live
in this chair.

674
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:53,316
And l wouldn't be here
if you'd let me have

675
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:56,184
the goddammed
motherfucking paper route.

676
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:08,332
The man is like
a father to me.

677
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:11,096
Well, there comes a time for every son
to leave his father's house,

678
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,160
make his own way.

679
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:15,764
Even so,
l can't betray him.

680
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:18,741
Do you believe what he's
instigated is wrong?

681
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,573
For the most part, yes.

682
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,738
And do you believe that many people
will suffer as a result?

683
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,247
Yes.

684
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,648
You know, l've always
admired you, Augustus,

685
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:30,620
for being
your own man,

686
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:33,249
for keeping-- especially
in this place--

687
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:36,852
a sense of decency
and honor.

688
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:39,658
What good
has it ever done?

689
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:42,689
You get to sleep
through the night.

690
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,074
l need
to talk to you.

691
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:00,310
- So talk.
- ln private.

692
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:21,433
- Yo, bro'.
- What you want?

693
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:23,337
- A sip of water.
- l ain't no nurse.

694
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:26,002
Come on. l'm so thirsty, man.
Please.

695
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:58,937
Mmm, it's so good.

696
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,342
lt's so good.

697
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:04,944
Up-- up, baby!

698
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:07,644
Yo, throw the ball.

699
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:37,240
- Do not resist.
- Okay, okay, okay.

700
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,774
Lockdown!

701
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,565
When l was a kid, l used to love
reading Jack London.

702
00:46:00,604 --> 00:46:03,505
You know, ''Call of the Wild,''
''White Fang.''

703
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,476
l remember one story where a man
was in the middle of Alaska,

704
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,445
or somewhere,
isolated and cold.

705
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,540
He lost his dog team,
his legs were broken,

706
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,380
he realized he was going
to freeze to death.

707
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:19,082
So he buried himself in the snow
and simply went to sleep.

708
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:24,092
Terrifying
and yet beautiful.

709
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:27,029
Acceptance of one's fate,

710
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,362
the way
any man should die.

711
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,594
Giles, get up.

712
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,769
We're a month away
from the date set by the Court

713
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:43,780
for your execution.

714
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:47,113
You'll have to decide
which way you want to go.

715
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,953
Die old...

716
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:54,116
sleep?

717
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:58,891
Yeah, well,
that's not an option.

718
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:03,026
Peter Marie.

719
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:05,160
l'll ask her
to see you.

720
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:15,837
Hey, don't you be
crying, man.

721
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,541
Your crying's
gonna bring me down.

722
00:47:22,353 --> 00:47:24,480
Stop your fucking crying!

723
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:31,386
And then there's gas.

724
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:34,022
They put you in
a little room

725
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:36,055
and drop a pellet

726
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,161
of sodium c-cyanide...

727
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:43,605
your lungs fill up,
and that's the end.

728
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:46,610
S-stoned?

729
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:49,169
Gee, l don't know
if that gas makes you high.

730
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:53,081
No... rocks.

731
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,108
l don't understand.

732
00:47:57,421 --> 00:48:01,448
- Throw.
- Wait a minute...

733
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:03,460
you want to be stoned
to death?

734
00:48:03,494 --> 00:48:06,190
Shirley Jackson?

735
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:11,126
Moses,
listen to me.

736
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:13,693
As your lawyer,
l have to tell you

737
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:17,195
there's a very good chance that you're
looking at another death sentence.

738
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,903
So we'll appeal
that one, too.

739
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:22,378
Yes, but
Congress has placed

740
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:24,745
a lot of limitations
on death row appeals.

741
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:25,976
Which means?

742
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:28,917
Which means that you will
probably be executed

743
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:32,445
for one or both
of these crimes.

744
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,616
You have to prepare
for what might be coming.

745
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:37,058
Huh.

746
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:41,292
You see, l ain't thought through
that part of the situation,

747
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:44,392
because--
l haven't given up hope.

748
00:48:44,435 --> 00:48:46,164
l'm a man of principles,
you understand?

749
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:48,433
And l believe down
to the bottom of my soul

750
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:50,599
that a man
with principles will--

751
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,609
will be exonerated.

752
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:57,239
lt's always good to hope.
But just in case,

753
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:59,749
you might want to make
some plans,

754
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,048
you know?
Get your house in order.

755
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:11,293
The State Attorney General
has refused your request

756
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,796
to be executed by being
stoned to death.

757
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:16,664
Law-- right, mine.

758
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,727
An anti-death-penalty group has
decided to take up your cause.

759
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:24,707
They're-- they're going to sue
the State on your behalf.

760
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:27,768
This mess will probably
drag out for decades.

761
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,548
Peter--
Peter Marie.

762
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:38,077
Lights out!

763
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:47,860
Giles?
Psst, Giles?

764
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:49,798
This whole time l thought
you were a damned idiot

765
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,801
talking in flash cards,

766
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:54,497
but now l see
you're a fucking genius.

767
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:57,336
No-- genius, no.

768
00:49:57,374 --> 00:50:01,208
Yes, genius, yes.
You were supposed to die in two weeks.

769
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:04,840
All your appeals dried up.
But by asking to be stoned to death,

770
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,850
you threw a wrench
in the works.

771
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:10,581
Everybody's suing everybody.
And like the warden says,

772
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,714
this could take years
to sort out.

773
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:17,557
Die old...
sleep?

774
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:21,325
Oh, Giles, you are an inspiration
to us all, brother.

775
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:34,034
l'm curious as to why you asked
the warden to see me.

776
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:36,273
l just finished reading
your book.

777
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:39,578
- lt's awesome.
- Thank you.

778
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:43,313
The section on Jefferson Keane,
being on death row

779
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:47,085
and giving his kidney to his sister,
it really got to me.

780
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:50,651
l still hear
from Grace.

781
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:52,662
She's very happy,
very healthy.

782
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:56,462
Well, l want to do
the same thing--

783
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,468
give my organs away.

784
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:03,098
Let others make use of my insides
when l'm done with them.

785
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,108
The only thing is...

786
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:08,737
l want to meet the people
l'm going to help.

787
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:12,408
l'm not sure
that's allowed.

788
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,576
You can
make it happen, Said.

789
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:18,679
l know you can.
Power through faith.

790
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:21,850
l'll see
what l can do.

791
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:39,506
Well, brother,
l stood where you are now.

792
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:42,603
And, yo, l know
the need to be a man,

793
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:47,015
but being a man ain't fueled by drugs
or fists or banging your bitch.

794
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,747
Being a man starts here.

795
00:51:52,723 --> 00:51:55,817
- Ah, Salah's making another convert.
- Yes.

796
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,089
He has a way of talking
to people on their level.

797
00:51:58,128 --> 00:51:59,720
You did a great job
guiding him.

798
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:10,997
Leroy.

799
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:14,068
What you want, Robson?

800
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:18,047
l'm a patient man,
a tolerant man.

801
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,140
but my friend
Jaz here is not.

802
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:23,017
- That's right.
- We had a deal:

803
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:25,851
Half the cash in advance
for you to whack Kareem Said,

804
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:28,289
but Said's still walking.

805
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:31,692
You said you had a long-term plan
to get close to him.

806
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:35,289
Well, Jaz is feeling
the clock has run out.

807
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:37,493
''Tick-tock,'' Leroy.

808
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:39,695
First, my name ain't
Leroy Tidd no more.

809
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:42,603
My name's Salah Yudin.

810
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,338
Second, l know l said l promised
to kill Said, but l've changed my mind.

811
00:52:47,377 --> 00:52:52,371
First, in order to change your mind,
you gotta have a mind.

812
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:57,376
And, Leroy...
you got shit for brains.

813
00:52:57,421 --> 00:53:00,117
Second, you don't back out
on the Brotherhood.

814
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:01,818
As-Salaam Alaikum.

815
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:04,020
Don't give me that fucking
hocus-pocus bullshit.

816
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:07,121
Robson, you looking for
jerk-off time in the hole?

817
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:10,190
- Uh, no.
- Then goose-step your butt out of here.

818
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:14,026
This shit ain't over.

819
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:27,315
Salah, you seem
troubled.

820
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:31,549
- My soul is heavy, Minister.
- So talk to me.

821
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,149
l'm afraid, afraid
to speak the truth.

822
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:37,251
Never be afraid of the truth,
my brother.

823
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:39,922
l lied to you.

824
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:41,931
You see, when l
first approached you

825
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:43,865
saying l wanted
to become a Muslim,

826
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,869
l had vengeance
in my heart

827
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:48,872
'cause of what you did
killing Adebisi.

828
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:52,501
But then the bliss of Allah
replaced the vengeance,

829
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:54,101
and now l'm
a true believer.

830
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:57,511
l knew the day
that l embraced you,

831
00:53:57,548 --> 00:53:59,641
that you were lying.

832
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,378
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

833
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:03,682
Then why?

834
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,417
The ways of the Almighty
are wondrous, indeed.

835
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:11,086
He brought us together
at this time and this place

836
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,619
so that we could
learn from each other.

837
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:16,929
You learn
from me? How?

838
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:20,061
That day l went to Adebisi
and l swore my loyalty to him--

839
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,841
Since his death, l have been
struggling with my demons.

840
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:29,711
Still do...

841
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:33,978
but you've taught me
the world has many possibilities.

842
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:37,316
Robson and Hoyt
want you dead.

843
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:40,846
- l know.
- What are we going to do?

844
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,951
As with
everything else...

845
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:46,963
we'll leave this
in the hands of God.

846
00:54:55,038 --> 00:54:58,474
lf you take care of this,
l'll bring you into the Brotherhood.

847
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:01,966
lf you don't,
l'll feed you to them.

848
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:05,004
- Take that!
- Fuck you, man. l told you--

849
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:09,145
l'm ready to do
whatever you need.

850
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:46,116
No! No!

851
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:05,802
lmam...

852
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:11,038
Salah is dead.

853
00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:14,643
l killed him, you know.

854
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:19,887
l killed him just
like l killed Adebisi.

855
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:26,488
l might has well have
had the knife in my hand...

856
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:31,734
in these bloody hands.

857
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:37,263
- Kareem--
- No, say nothing.

858
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:40,606
- But you can't blame yourself.
- Leave me...

859
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:44,273
because my demons
need feeding.

860
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:48,314
Leave me!

861
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:09,066
They say that every
snowflake is different,

862
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:11,301
but how can they
really be sure?

863
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:13,969
l mean, think about all the snowflakes
that have fallen

864
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,638
all over the world
throughout Earth's history.

865
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,047
Law of averages dictates that at least
two of them had to be similar.

866
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,846
Like human beings,
like the men in Oz--

867
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:24,786
even if they
start out unique,

868
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:26,948
they end up the same.
