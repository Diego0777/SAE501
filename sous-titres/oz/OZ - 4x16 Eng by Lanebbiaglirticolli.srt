1
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,535
l've been
wondering something.

2
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,979
From the time we
learn to speak until the day we die,

3
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:44,779
how many words
does the average person say?

4
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:49,118
l mean, we talk
and talk and talk, filling up the ozone,

5
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,454
secretly hoping that in
all those syllables,

6
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,550
we've said something
worth remembering.

7
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:56,585
Deep down,
we know the truth.

8
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,030
Most of what we say
is trash.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do you think
you're landing, chief?

10
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,304
Where do you think
you're landing?

11
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,796
- l need to talk to Burr.
- He busy.

12
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,804
- l'll wait.
- He's never not gonna be busy

13
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,939
when it comes to you,
snitch.

14
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,756
Stupid bitch.

15
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:37,999
You're not having
much luck

16
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:40,233
getting the brothers
to turn against Redding.

17
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:42,969
You also said Hill
was going to kill the old bastard.

18
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,842
Don't worry.
Redding's gonna die...

19
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,574
and soon.

20
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,584
Shakedown!

21
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,731
No, no, no.

22
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:11,002
- That ain't mine.
- Bullshit it's not.

23
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,562
Hey, Murph, that's not--
that ain't mine, man.

24
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,802
lt's definitely not mine.
Take him to McManus.

25
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:19,107
- Take him away.
- lt's not-- come on, man. That's not--

26
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,845
Sister, look,
you know me.

27
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,545
l've been clean
for over three years.

28
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:28,486
He's not using, Tim.
l would stake my reputation on that.

29
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,547
lf you're not using,
then you're selling.

30
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,081
No, somebody planted
that shit in my pod.

31
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,959
- Why?
- l-- l don't know.

32
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:37,691
- Do the tits belong to White?
- No!

33
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,824
- Then who are you protecting?
- Nobody!

34
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,061
All right.
l'm going to put you back in Em City,

35
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,866
only with no punishment.
This way all your little friends will

36
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:48,170
- think that you ratted on them again.
- McManus, put me in the hole.

37
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,541
- Officer.
- McManus, put me in the fucking hole!

38
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,521
You see what l'm saying?

39
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,966
Redding's the one that put
them drugs in your cell.

40
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:18,664
Maybe you arranged that.
Fuck, l don't know who to trust.

41
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:20,434
lt don't matter.

42
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:23,909
Redding don't trust you,
never will.

43
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:27,402
You only got one choice:
grease him.

44
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,280
l kill Redding,
then you take charge.

45
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,046
And l won't forget
what you done.

46
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,349
Well, l haven't forgotten
what you've done,

47
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,820
jabbering to the cops
on me.

48
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,948
l told you l'm trying
to make that shit up to you.

49
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,084
And l told you to leave me
the fuck alone.

50
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,759
You know, l'm done trying
to please you, Augustus.

51
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,702
l'm gonna take care
of business myself.

52
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,805
No, don't.

53
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,867
Supreme. Supreme.

54
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,436
l'll kill him.

55
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,540
Look, if he's gonna die,
l'd rather he die at my hands.

56
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,143
- l'll make sure it won't hurt.
- Whatever.

57
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,177
Just do the deed.

58
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,496
- Hardin.
- You wanted to see me?

59
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,898
- You still working bedpan?
- Uh-huh.

60
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:25,835
l need some
medical records.

61
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,742
Poet?
Yo, Poet?

62
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,974
Don't be talking
to me, snitch.

63
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,643
As far as we're concerned,
you're a dead man, a ghost.

64
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:39,481
- A ghost on wheels.
- Hey, listen, man.

65
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,009
l'm trying to save
Burr's life.

66
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,817
What you
talking about, man?

67
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,654
Supreme Allah--

68
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,523
l remember
back on the corner

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,619
he used to be
crazy allergic to something.

70
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:53,030
According to his records,
it's eggs.

71
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,534
Yeah, when we be
prepping his meals,

72
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,695
we got to fix
his shit real special.

73
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,568
Not today.

74
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,568
Eat hardy.

75
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,712
That bitch Burr
is still alive, Augustus.

76
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,246
What's up
with that?

77
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,419
l got to get close
to him, don't l?

78
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,827
l got to get back
in his good graces.

79
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,728
That's going
to take some time.

80
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,259
Well, you ain't
got time.

81
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,507
Something wrong?

82
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,218
- Oh, shit.
- You did this, didn't you?

83
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:01,393
You fucking-- oh!

84
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,334
Poet told me
what you done.

85
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,302
l came to thank you

86
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:40,568
and welcome you back
into the fold.

87
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,576
l accept your thanks.

88
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,906
But l don't want
to be back in.

89
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,882
l don't want
to sell drugs.

90
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,249
Your choice.

91
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,379
l respect that.

92
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,548
Respect?

93
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,286
l killed a man today.

94
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:03,022
l caused his death
to happen.

95
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:05,656
And even though Allah
was going to hurt you,

96
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,360
even though the motherfucker
screwed me to this chair,

97
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,928
l don't feel good
about what l done.

98
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:17,705
Well, then, Augustus,
l raised you right.

99
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:35,755
My daughter's coming today. Says she
has something important to tell me.

100
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,922
Well, when you
finish your visit,

101
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,194
l need you
to perform a task.

102
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:44,260
Like l said,
l'm here for you.

103
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,295
''Airhole'' Morales.

104
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,775
What about Pancamo?

105
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:54,644
His time will come,
but Morales goes first.

106
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:04,379
- Hey.
- Patricia.

107
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,394
So what did you
want to tell me?

108
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,525
Jeez, Dad, no ''How are you?
How's your mom?''

109
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,434
ls it bad news?
You're not leaving the Corps, are you?

110
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,461
Stop looking
so grim.

111
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,234
l'm getting married.

112
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,577
Married?
To Max?

113
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:29,343
Of course to Max.

114
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:32,180
That's wonderful news, sweetheart.
l'm so happy for you.

115
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,311
Thanks.

116
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:38,222
Dad, the thing is...

117
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:41,352
since you won't be there
to walk me down the aisle,

118
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:44,454
l was going to ask Myron.

119
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,591
l know how you feel
about him,

120
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:51,035
but he and Mom
have been married 20 years.

121
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,868
l-- l grew up
in his house.

122
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,971
l've got work detail.

123
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,277
Dad, l need your answer.

124
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,448
Do whatever the fuck
you want.

125
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,530
The goddamn thing
stopped dead.

126
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:21,533
We were able to get the warden out
but he wants it fixed pronto.

127
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,900
You both work mechanical,
so we figured you could take a look.

128
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:28,101
Oh, when l was a kid, l used to work
for Otis fixing elevators.

129
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,041
l know these suckers
backwards and forwards.

130
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,067
Whoa there, Otis.

131
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,678
Were you in the cafeteria
when that colored guy bought the farm?

132
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,417
Supreme Allah?
Yeah.

133
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,425
Talk about bugging out.
Hand me a wrench.

134
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,695
Life's pretty precarious
around here.

135
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,857
Yeah? Even more so
than in Nam?

136
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:55,663
The land-mines in Oz
are even less visible.

137
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:59,331
Friends turn on friends,
enemies buddy up.

138
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:01,966
l'm not used to that
kind of behavior.

139
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,971
l like to know who
my adversaries are.

140
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,014
Get up!
Get up!

141
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,028
Be all you can be, babe.

142
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:38,742
When someone dies,
we look at the last thing he or she said

143
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,372
in hopes of finding
a summation of life,

144
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:45,350
a deep truth that those of us above
ground can cling to.

145
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,945
Like the novelist,
Daniel Defoe,

146
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,353
''l do not know
which is more difficult,

147
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,154
to live well
or to die well.''

148
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,127
ln Oz,
we do neither.

149
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,299
Jeremiah, the purpose
for my visit is--

150
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,070
and l wanted to do this
face to face.

151
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,938
The board of elders
met yesterday and decided

152
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:11,637
to ask you for your
resignation

153
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,838
as head of the new
Church of Christ.

154
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,647
The elders voted unanimously
on the day of my conviction

155
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,244
that they would
stand behind me,

156
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,848
- to support me no matter what.
- l know.

157
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:28,725
But the scandal has severely damaged
our fundraising efforts.

158
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,991
l want to talk
to the elders.

159
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,021
How, via satellite?

160
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,193
They can come here
to Oz.

161
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,724
Oh, Jeremiah,
be serious.

162
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,067
Those old men are not
coming here.

163
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,467
Letter of resignation.

164
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,610
Sign.

165
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,137
All l'm saying is Cloutier thinks
he's better than all of us.

166
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,698
- How do you mean?
- Warden's got us doing physical labor.

167
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:19,404
Cloutier's got a cushy job
in the requisitions office.

168
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:22,005
We're loading cement,
he's pushing a pen.

169
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,845
He should be
slaving alongside us.

170
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,078
Sowing more seeds
of discontent?

171
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,110
Just telling
my friends what's what.

172
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:30,019
Get up.

173
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:33,548
Did l ever mention why he threw me out
of the congregation?

174
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,584
Not because
l threatened someone

175
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,619
in the name of the Lord,

176
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,631
but because l disagreed
with him.

177
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:42,793
He tries to silence anyone
whose opinions differ.

178
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,700
Jim, escort this man out.

179
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,205
He has the right
to finish his thought.

180
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:50,709
All right,

181
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,234
let him speak.

182
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,511
Excuse me one second.

183
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,644
Hoyt,

184
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:05,384
you still looking to do
the Reverend Cloutier some harm?

185
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,915
Why?
You want him dead?

186
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,396
Not... dead, exactly.

187
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,574
Looking for this?

188
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,574
Give me the towel.

189
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,720
And so this proves what,
that you're stronger than me?

190
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,523
ln brute strength, maybe,

191
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:45,759
but l got the power
of Jesus on my side.

192
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,595
Well, good.

193
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,397
Then have the Lord Jesus
get you another towel.

194
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:24,402
When l was 10, my father
was a tent revival preacher.

195
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,565
He called me up on stage.

196
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,905
l was 10 years old.

197
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:33,378
l touched the eyes of a blind man
and he was healed.

198
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:37,280
From that moment on,
l-- l was special, famous.

199
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:40,911
Everywhere l went, on TV, crowds
of people wanting to touch me.

200
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,979
Wow.
That must be something.

201
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,287
Fame became
all that l knew.

202
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:49,317
Penthouses, limousines.

203
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,830
When l took the money
from my congregation,

204
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,889
l didn't even think
that l was stealing.

205
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:57,027
lt seemed like l was taking
what was rightfully mine.

206
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:02,533
Listen to me.

207
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,873
Pride.

208
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,605
Pride is the worst sin

209
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,944
for it is pride
that separates us from God.

210
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,449
Deliverance
comes from Jesus.

211
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:16,649
Yes, and He has
humbled me.

212
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,622
ln order to win
your congregation back,

213
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,856
you must show them that you're not
their superior, but their equal.

214
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,723
How do l do that?

215
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,291
By joining them
in their work.

216
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,963
''The labor of the righteous
tendeth to life.''

217
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:40,712
The last three words spoken by Jesus
were, ''lt is finished.''

218
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,714
Now, being the Son of God,

219
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,716
he probably knew
the end was coming

220
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,741
and had a chance
to consider what to say.

221
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,879
The rest of us don't
get that luxury.

222
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,253
When death comes,
it's a surprise,

223
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,451
and we got to improvise.

224
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:56,461
l have to tell you, Cloutier,
you really impressed me.

225
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,463
You really heeded the call.

226
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,488
Your followers
are tickled to death

227
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,194
you're helping me
build this wall.

228
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:05,135
Please, son, l beg you, think about
what it is that you're doing.

229
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,264
Oh, l've thought
about this completely.

230
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:10,503
When the hacks ask where you are,
l'll say, ''l don't know.

231
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:12,511
Maybe the good reverend
ascended into heaven.''

232
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,775
Help!

233
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,839
Help!
Help me!

234
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,476
They can't help you.
Nobody's here, remember?

235
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:22,487
And l paid the hacks
an extra 200 bucks to take a hike.

236
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,059
You're both going to burn in hell
for all eternity.

237
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,153
You should have just taken the blow job
when l offered it.

238
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,256
Help!
Help me!

239
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,530
Help! Help me!

240
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:39,060
Help!

241
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:51,273
The Lord is my shepherd,
l shall not want.

242
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:01,990
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness for His name's sake.

243
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,359
Yea, though l walk

244
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:07,389
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

245
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,493
l will fear no evil!

246
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:26,044
Oh fuck.

247
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,383
Hughes?

248
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,515
Hey, l don't feel too good.

249
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,559
Fuck!

250
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,558
Hey, you stupid fucks,
listen up!

251
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:10,460
l hereby declare this unit
the Republic of Huhru.

252
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:11,963
Huhru! Huhru! Huhru!

253
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:14,363
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Until such time

254
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,369
as we can organize free
and fair elections,

255
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,030
l have assumed command.

256
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,871
You shall henceforth and to wit refer
to me as ''Your Excellency.''

257
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,967
Hughes, you're
a fucking nut job!

258
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,808
For that insubordination, Alvarez,
you shall remain inside your cell.

259
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,783
ln fact, until all of you
have proven your loyalties

260
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,512
to our new republic,

261
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:36,612
and to the principles
stated in my manifesto,

262
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:40,455
you shall stay
right where you are.

263
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,525
Hey, open the fucking door!

264
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,757
Get a fucking CO in here.

265
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,261
Central, this is Gamba Kufu,

266
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,671
acting President
of the Republic of Huhru.

267
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,370
l want to speak
to Warden Leo Glynn.

268
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,476
Hello?

269
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,178
Yes.

270
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:08,345
Oh, l'll tell him.

271
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,879
You better stop this nonsense,
and give yourself up right now.

272
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:13,824
And you better stop
your yapping, Smith,

273
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,124
or you're going to find my dick
burrowing towards your prostate.

274
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:20,359
Clayton, this is Leo.

275
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:24,267
You shall refer to me as Gamba Kufu
or Your Excellency.

276
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:26,066
- Clayton--
- Gamba!

277
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,437
How's Officer Smith?

278
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:30,567
Well, that depends on you.

279
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,672
- Listen to me, Clayton--
- Gamba.

280
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:37,341
- Clayton!
- Until you begin addressing me

281
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,442
with the respect befitting
my high office,

282
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,476
l am terminating
this conversation.

283
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,022
- Do you have the key?
- On its way.

284
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,496
l want you to unlock the door.
l'm going to go in first.

285
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,259
l wouldn't recommend
that, sir.

286
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,358
This isn't heroics,
Commander.

287
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,596
lt's good
old-fashioned guilt.

288
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:02,400
Hey, Your Excellency.

289
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:05,308
You seem to have everything
under control.

290
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:08,370
Only l want to make sure
you don't get the rest of us killed

291
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,939
and l want to know
what your plan is.

292
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,315
- My plan?
- Yeah.

293
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:15,479
'Cause l remember during
the riot a few years ago,

294
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,081
Said, Adebisi
and the rest of them,

295
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:20,216
they created a strategy.

296
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,956
Pender, your experience
makes you invaluable to the revolution.

297
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,732
l hereby name you
my acting Vice President.

298
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:38,140
- l'm honored.
- Ready to take the oath of office?

299
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:40,202
l don't think we time
for that, 'cause any moment

300
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:42,577
the SORT boys are going to burst in here
and mow us down.

301
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:44,640
Like Napoleon
back from Elba,

302
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,447
l shall speak to the men
and convince them to join our side.

303
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,386
Okay, but if that
doesn't work,

304
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:52,151
you might want to consider using
your hostage as a shield.

305
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,216
- Excellent idea.
- Yeah.

306
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:56,193
Fuck, here they come!

307
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:08,232
Hello, Leo.
Welcome to Huhru.

308
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:10,241
l've never lied
to you, have l?

309
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,946
Then l want you to listen
carefully to what l say.

310
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:20,349
The thoughts in your mind
aren't real.

311
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,547
You spent too much
time alone.

312
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:25,557
You've created a world
in your head.

313
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,617
There is no Huhru.

314
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,720
Your name is Clayton Hughes.

315
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:33,163
l am Gamba Kufu.

316
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:38,267
Your name
is Clayton Hughes,

317
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,168
and you're lost.

318
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,173
l want to help you.

319
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,469
l remember the day my

320
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:51,278
dad died,
l felt this way.

321
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:56,018
l remember you and me
in the hospital.

322
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,717
You hugging me.

323
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,421
l miss those hugs, Leo.

324
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,895
Will you hug me now?

325
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:19,938
l'll give up if you
hug me right now.

326
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,139
All right.

327
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,685
lt's all right, Clayton.
lt's going to be all right.

328
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:33,918
Hey!

329
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,893
- Commander!
- Go, go! Move!

330
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:44,869
Oh, fuck!

331
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:47,394
l saved your
fucking life, Glynn!

332
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:50,033
You owe me!
You owe me!

333
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,413
Clayton. Oh God.

334
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:59,315
Clayton--
my God.

335
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:02,650
My plan worked perfectly.

336
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,386
Hug me, Leo.

337
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:10,259
Hug me.
Hug me, Leo.

338
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:18,794
- Hug me.
- Oh, my God.

339
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:25,803
Not everybody leaves this mortal coil
miserable and confused.

340
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,642
Ethel Waters said,
''l'm not afraid to die, honey.

341
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,739
ln fact, l'm kind of looking
forward to it.

342
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:33,775
l know that the Lord
has His arms wrapped around

343
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:36,151
this big,
fat sparrow.''

344
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,753
l'm heading out
for the night,

345
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:46,765
unless you need me
to do something.

346
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,701
Today, l had to call
my best friend's widow

347
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:54,570
and inform her
that her only child was dead.

348
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:57,439
That he died in my arms
the same as his father.

349
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:02,444
l don't ever want to have
to make another call like that again.

350
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,382
There is one last thing
you can do.

351
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,851
Take a letter.

352
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:19,722
To Martin Douglas...

353
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,132
Commissioner,
Bureau of Prisons.

354
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,502
Dear Martin,
l resign as Warden

355
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,406
of Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

356
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:33,843
effective as soon
as a replacement can be found.

357
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,906
Why'd you stop writing?

358
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,712
Because you don't mean it.

359
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,150
Oh, l do, Floria.

360
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:46,815
lt's time for me to move on,
move up, move out.

361
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:49,157
No-- but you do a lot
of good here.

362
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:51,287
l do shit!

363
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:55,532
That letter goes out
first thing tomorrow.

364
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:57,831
Okay, well, why don't
we have dinner?

365
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,466
No, that's okay.

366
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:04,873
Well, l'm not going
to leave you like this.

367
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,471
l'm headed over
to see Clayton's mom.

368
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,640
My wife's already there.

369
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:13,742
We'll sit together, cry,

370
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:15,912
remember the good times

371
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,616
and try to make sense
out of...

372
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,618
what is senseless.

373
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,100
Good night.

374
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:52,989
Any news on how
Dave Brass is doing?

375
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:55,220
He's out of the hospital,

376
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,023
but his leg's
all fucked up.

377
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:59,462
He's never going to play
basketball again.

378
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,297
Heard the last game
was called off.

379
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,737
Glynn told me
that was your decision.

380
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:09,468
So?
What's the difference?

381
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:15,343
- l want to take Dave Brass' place.
- What?

382
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,008
l want you and l to play
the last game together.

383
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,540
Fuck you!

384
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,211
Because l turned
you down before?

385
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,448
- That's right!
- Okay, well, fuck me for that!

386
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:26,355
But listen, Tim, you made
a believer out of me, man.

387
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,154
- Huh?
- l was watching.

388
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:31,253
You played balls out with a lot
of fucking heart in both those games.

389
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:33,287
But Brass, he was
a phenomenal player.

390
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,096
l don't think anybody really noticed
how good you were playing.

391
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:38,068
And isn't that
the whole point of all this?

392
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:41,072
To show the dinks in here that if a guy
puts his mind to something--

393
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:42,733
- We can't win.
- l know.

394
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,605
But if we could
hold our own,

395
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:47,771
two average white guys
with bad bodies,

396
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:49,474
hanging with Vahue.

397
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,846
l mean, that would
mean something, man.

398
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:59,513
?? Get on top ??

399
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,753
?? Help me ??

400
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:04,591
?? Come get me ??

401
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:07,564
?? l'll bite, but...
she bit me ??

402
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,658
?? Gorilla, cuntilla ??

403
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,896
?? Sammy D
and salmonella ??

404
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:14,030
?? Come with me,
'cause l'm an ass killer ??

405
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,903
?? You're ill
but l'm iller ??

406
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:18,273
?? l'll malinger
on your block ??

407
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,278
?? And give the finger
to a cop ??

408
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,303
?? And pick a lock
before l knock ??

409
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:24,338
?? And set you up
to get on top ??

410
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,481
?? Get on top ??

411
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,581
?? Complications
of a mastermind ??

412
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:37,027
?? Last temptation
of my kind ??

413
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:41,328
?? lnterplanetary sign,
when do we align? Get on top ??

414
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:44,028
?? All in time ??

415
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:46,264
?? Right on ??

416
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:50,575
?? Get up,
come sit up ??

417
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:54,010
?? l light but...
she lit up ??

418
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:56,139
?? Grasshopper,
show stopper ??

419
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,149
?? The life
of a wife swapper ??

420
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:00,481
?? Come with me
'cause l'm a big bopper ??

421
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,487
?? You do
but l wopper ??

422
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,546
?? Exterminate my cause ??

423
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,284
?? You want to draw
some straws ??

424
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,224
?? Be the one
to see my flaws ??

425
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,888
?? Make me bleed
with painted claws ??

426
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:16,164
- ?? Get on top. ??
- l don't know why l think l can help,

427
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,726
but l'm not giving up
on you, Omar.

428
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,330
You understand?
l'm not giving up.

429
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,840
Thank you.

430
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,142
Hey, yo, Omar.

431
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,809
What's up, man?

432
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,045
Man, you know l don't fuck
around with that shit no more.

433
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:38,022
- Call me Mr. Clean around here, man.
- Oh yeah. Oh shit.

434
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:43,587
- Morning.
- Hey, my man, MacDaddy McManus.

435
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:45,289
How you doing, man?
How was your weekend?

436
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,195
lt was good.
l got a lot of work done.

437
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:49,166
Work?
What, no play?

438
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:52,034
You ain't have no, like,
romantic interludes?

439
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,335
Well, sure. Saturday night l took out
this Portuguese dancer.

440
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,273
What, a stripper?

441
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,972
- No, no, ballet. Ballet.
- Ballet?

442
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:03,003
Them ballet bitches,
they too skinny and shit.

443
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,016
They looking like
teenage boys and shit.

444
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,450
You got to get you
a stripper.

445
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:09,954
- See you. Okay, Omar?
- Can l go up with you?

446
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:11,615
Well, you know--
No.

447
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:16,184
Let me get settled
for a while, okay?

448
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,923
O--okay.

449
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:20,124
ls there a problem?
ls there something that can't wait?

450
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:24,226
Well, no.
lt's just, you know,

451
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:26,499
l'm feeling a little shaky,
you know what l mean.

452
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:28,733
Yeah, okay.
Come on up.

453
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:30,741
Come on. Come on.

454
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,709
Yeah, like l was saying, man.
You got to get you a stripper.

455
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:35,008
l used to have this stripper,
a bitch named Angelina.

456
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:38,880
Whoo-hoo! And that bitch could suck
a dick, too.

457
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,613
Omar's been off the drugs
for weeks now.

458
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:44,588
He goes to rehab regular,
he goes to class,

459
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:46,784
he does his work
assignments.

460
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:48,520
He's become
the model prisoner.

461
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,688
- And he's driving you crazy.
- Yes!

462
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,721
Whenever l'm in Em City,
he follows me around,

463
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,562
everywhere,
like a two-year-old.

464
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,591
And he goes on and on
about nothing.

465
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,831
So? Tell the jerk
to beat it.

466
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:01,634
And risk him sliding back?
No way.

467
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:03,368
Well, then,
as the French say,

468
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,876
you are up shit's creek
sans paddle.

469
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:08,345
For the second
straight week,

470
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,281
we have a new contestant
and a new celebrity.

471
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:14,251
ln fact, a man who's been let out
of jail especially for the show.

472
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,151
- Tim McManus, welcome.
- What?

473
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:20,318
Holy shit, look at that. Motherfucking
McManus starring up on TV.

474
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:23,054
And l want to introduce
our young star today.

475
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:25,790
He's the other Tony Soprano,
Robert ller.

476
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,025
- Robert, thank you...
- We got to get cable.

477
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,034
We are missing out
on all the good shit.

478
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:35,301
Hey, yo, l hear the women on ''Sex
and the City'' are hot, son. Hot

479
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,002
l'd fuck that Sarah
whatever-her-name-is, man.

480
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,443
Would you guys just shut
the fuck up, please? Shit.

481
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,446
We start off
with $10,

482
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,677
and the category today,
Tim, is vocabulary.

483
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,185
And the questions is:
What is a ''tittle''?

484
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,780
l think l know this.

485
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:54,280
l'm going to humor you,
l'm going to ask for a hint.

486
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:57,022
Did you cover this in
sixth-grade English, Robert?

487
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,962
Well, first off,
l'm in high school.

488
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:01,795
And yeah, they did cover this
in the third grade.

489
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,994
Would you like to give
him a hint, Robert?

490
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,900
lt comes
with crosses on t's.

491
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:08,371
l saw a show where there were
discussing ''tittles,''

492
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:11,170
and it wasn't punctuation.

493
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:14,508
Yeah, it's not punctuation.
lt's a diacritical mark.

494
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:17,379
- Kid's right.
- You're a good guy, Robert,

495
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:19,679
but l've been around
a little longer.

496
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,312
A ''tittle''
is a breast implant.

497
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:24,447
Leave it to McManus
to go for breasts.

498
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,652
No. ln fact,
it is the dot above an ''l.''

499
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:35,323
l always knew McManus was an idiot.
Now everybody else does, too.

500
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,733
Yo, don't be fucking
dogging McManus out, all right?

501
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:39,703
Oh, l'm sorry, White.

502
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,968
l forgot you've been
sucking his cock these days.

503
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,373
l'm not sucking
his cock, faggot.

504
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:47,469
Then you must be
taking it up the ass.

505
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:51,278
- Oh.
- You mother!

506
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:58,088
- Oh, shit!
- Motherfucker!

507
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:02,451
- Motherfucker!
- Central, this is 11. We've got a 66.

508
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,855
Get out of here!

509
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,902
- Pedro Calderon died.
- The fuckin' spick came at me.

510
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,497
- Yeah, after you charged Guerra!
- He was making fun of you!

511
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,439
Well, the warden wants
you in solitary.

512
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,637
You said you'd never
give up on me.

513
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,340
You said you'd never let them
take me back.

514
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,010
l tried.
l argued as best l could. l lost.

515
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:31,182
l won't fucking survive in solitary,
you understand?

516
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:33,349
lt's too much dead air,
too much dead time!

517
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,882
- l can't do it!
- There's nothing l can do.

518
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,521
You fuck.

519
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,531
You fuck!

520
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:44,001
You fucking liar!
You fucking lied to me!

521
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:47,471
- Settle down there, White.
- You fucking settle down!

522
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:51,475
You motherfucking liar.

523
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,000
You fucking lied to me!

524
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:57,344
You fucking, motherfucking,
cocksucking liar!

525
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,077
You lied to me!

526
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:02,280
Everybody's always
fucking lying to me!

527
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:08,684
You said you wouldn't never
give up on me.

528
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:11,218
l don't want to go back!

529
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,230
Let me go!

530
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,528
You lied!

531
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,871
Okay, you're all done, Tim.
You should go home.

532
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,899
l'll drive you.

533
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:31,840
You know, White was right.
l didn't fight you hard enough.

534
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,784
l wanted to lose the argument.
l wanted him in solitary.

535
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,719
- l could tell.
- How?

536
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,781
You didn't stomp out of my office when
l wouldn't let you have your way.

537
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,985
l do want him
in Em City.

538
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:45,223
He already stabbed you, and now he
literally kicked the shit out of you.

539
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:49,165
l don't care.
Let him keep kicking.

540
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,330
l lost that basketball game,
because l gave up hope.

541
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:55,839
l won't abandon
Omar White. l won't.

542
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:59,810
You stay home a few days, and we'll talk
after you've had a chance to think.

543
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:03,177
Okay, but l'm not going
to change my mind, Leo,

544
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,910
because if l give up
on even one of these guys,

545
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,683
l might has well just open up a diner
somewhere, flip burgers till l die.

546
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:13,190
You know what?

547
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:14,816
l may join you.

548
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,266
ln 1955, James Dean said
to a friend,

549
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,530
''My fun days are over.''

550
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:26,969
An hour later, his car crashed,
and he was dead.

551
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:31,032
A self-fulfilling prophecy,
or just bad luck?

552
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,992
Hey, how'd that go?

553
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,726
l gave the blood. They're taking
a sample out of the baby.

554
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,734
lf the two match,
she's my granddaughter.

555
00:35:56,768 --> 00:36:00,067
While you were gone,
l heard something about Beecher.

556
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:03,073
- What about Beecher?
- You know he's up for parole?

557
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:06,300
No.

558
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,812
His hearing is scheduled
for sometime this week.

559
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,508
Jesus.

560
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:14,382
Rumor is, cocksucker's
got a good chance of getting out.

561
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,046
Give me that stick.

562
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,577
What are we solids?

563
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:20,682
Vern, Beecher fucked up
your parole.

564
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,057
Don't you think
l fucking remember that?

565
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:26,393
lf you'd been paroled, maybe your sons
would be alive and your granddaughter--

566
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,991
Shut the fuck up!

567
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,601
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Vern...

568
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:40,338
Why didn't you fucking mention
that you're up for parole?

569
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:42,175
This is not the way to start an
interaction.

570
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,977
Stay out of this! We're supposed
to be totally honest here.

571
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:47,280
- Officer!
- On equal goddamn footing.

572
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:48,512
Session's over.

573
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:50,111
All this time, you knew
you might be getting out.

574
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,486
- All right, Schillinjer.
- ''Schillinger!''

575
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:55,084
God damn it.
''Schillinger!''

576
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,855
l've been here
nine fucking years,

577
00:36:56,895 --> 00:37:00,058
you'd think you'd learn
how to say my goddamn name!

578
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,104
Oh Christ.

579
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,574
He's going to do something
to mess up my parole.

580
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,338
No, no, no.
l will talk to him.

581
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:16,006
- lt won't do any good.
- Tobias, l'll talk to him.

582
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,208
l'm fucked.

583
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,217
Hey, buddy.

584
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,018
Hey, mind if we
chow down with you?

585
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,255
- You gonna eat that orange?
- How about this milk, huh?

586
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,629
l'm sorry l didn't tell you
about the parole.

587
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:41,002
The truth is l don't really believe
it's going to happen.

588
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,666
Oh, it'll happen.

589
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:45,505
Those cocksuckers on the board
see a rich boy like you,

590
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:47,875
sobbing his story,
their little hearts will melt.

591
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:50,608
- Look--
- You're not going free, bitch.

592
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:54,209
You're not walking out of here
and leaving me behind.

593
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:59,222
Clean up this fucking mess.

594
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:07,287
l spoke to Schillinger.
He said all the right things.

595
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,061
He apologized
for his outburst.

596
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,297
He explained how important the
interaction sessions have been for him.

597
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:14,202
- Well, he's lying.
- l know.

598
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,229
Can you put me
in protective custody?

599
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,242
Well, normally, l would,
but the unit's full.

600
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,574
Well, then put Schillinger
in solitary.

601
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:23,581
Well, he hasn't done anything yet.
And besides, the unit's full.

602
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:26,812
- Well, fuck, lock down the prison!
- Just for you, Beecher?

603
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:31,379
Let's get serious. No, You'll stay in
your pod. You'll get your meals there.

604
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:35,222
l'll place an officer
outside your door. You'll be fine.

605
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:38,558
Why am l not
overwhelmed with relief?

606
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:48,662
Arif! Those bikers
are plotting something.

607
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,766
They want to provoke Beecher into
committing an act of violence,

608
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,369
- end his chance of parole.
- Yeah.

609
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,972
And l'm going to see
that he doesn't.

610
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,779
- And you're doing this all for Beecher?
- Oh yeah,

611
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:03,218
and for Salah Yudin,
and all those other lives

612
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,882
the Aryans have
already destroyed.

613
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,391
Hoyt said he can't
get anywhere near Beecher.

614
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,400
Oh, fuck!

615
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:20,196
- When's the hearing?
- Tomorrow, 11 :00.

616
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:22,035
Oh shit.

617
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:23,563
Well, well,
well, well...

618
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:26,304
lf it isn't
my old friend

619
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:28,403
James Robson.

620
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:32,906
Said, l promised the warden there
wouldn't be any trouble between us.

621
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,789
Officer...

622
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:41,257
You better stay nearby.

623
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,726
There might be a hoedown.

624
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,930
Can l see Beecher?

625
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:08,842
How you holding up?

626
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:10,945
Just got to make it through
one more night.

627
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:13,354
l've just been very
clear with Schillinger.

628
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,484
Any harm comes
to you,

629
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:17,585
and he will feel
the full wrath of Allah.

630
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,760
l appreciate that,
Kareem.

631
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:25,492
Assalaam alayka,
my brother.

632
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,066
Peace be unto you, too.

633
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:36,907
Though from what
l can see,

634
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:39,109
you're not in a very
peaceful place, huh?

635
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,813
l struggle, same as you.

636
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:45,750
You know...

637
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,425
when l was all screwy
about my hand

638
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,453
in Andrew Schillinger's
death, you told me

639
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:56,399
to embrace my guilt
or it would eat away at me forever.

640
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:58,061
Mm-hmm.

641
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:01,401
lt's funny that you haven't taken your
own advice regarding Adebisi.

642
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,999
How many times
l got to tell you, Tobias?

643
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,340
l feel no guilt
for killing Adebisi.

644
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,142
What haunts you
is not Adebisi's death, but his life.

645
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:13,082
- His life force.
- Haunts me?

646
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,347
What are you talking about?

647
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:18,253
l saw your face the moment
after you killed him,

648
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,655
and a bit of Adebisi
had bled into you.

649
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:22,386
- No.
- His anger...

650
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:25,122
- his violence...
- No, you're wrong!

651
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:28,894
Your entire life you've kept tight
control over your feelings.

652
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:32,232
You denied the Adebisi
in you, but you can't do it any longer.

653
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,103
You got to make him
part of you, Kareem.

654
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:38,370
Make him a part of you.

655
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,919
They're not going to
take my sweaty palms

656
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:01,796
as a sign
of criminal intent, are they?

657
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,824
Come on, will you relax?

658
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:06,598
l've been doing these kinds
of cases for six years now.

659
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:10,095
l have never been more sure
of an outcome in my life.

660
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:13,167
Yeah, well, you've never
had Tobias Beecher as a client before.

661
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,310
l got you a present.

662
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:26,949
l didn't have
a chance to wrap it.

663
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,890
- An appointment book.
- Yeah.

664
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,558
Mr. Beecher?

665
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,467
- We're ready for you.
- Okay.

666
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,503
Well, wish me luck.

667
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,565
l'll do more than that.

668
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:48,311
l'll do something
completely unprofessional.

669
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,953
Mr. Beecher.

670
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:00,680
Yeah, l'm coming.

671
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:02,283
Go.

672
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:16,198
And then they asked me about
defecating on Schillinger's face

673
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,971
and biting off the tip
of Robson's penis.

674
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:23,845
l'm not sure my answers
really satisfied them.

675
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:31,745
They voted yes.

676
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:35,190
Oh my God.

677
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,195
Oh my--
Oh my God.

678
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,698
- Tobias?
- l'm going home.

679
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,462
l'm going home.

680
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:48,700
- Un-fucking-believable!
- Oh my God!

681
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,556
Fuck me!
Cocksucker!

682
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:15,861
- All right, Beecher.
- Shut the fuck up.

683
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,440
- Beecher's going free.
- No.

684
00:44:30,514 --> 00:44:33,108
No.
l want him dead.

685
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,916
You understand?
Beecher does not leave Oz alive.

686
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,952
Mail!

687
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,393
Let's go, line it up!

688
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:59,469
- Here's a letter for Beecher.
- l'll give it to him.

689
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:06,376
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You motherfucker!

690
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,789
Motherfucker!

691
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:30,964
Louisa, please make sure
you hold his hands down.

692
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:47,991
l'm going to miss you.

693
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:51,461
Don't. Try not to even think
of this place.

694
00:45:51,495 --> 00:45:53,224
Well, that'll be hard.

695
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:55,425
l still have a swastika
tattooed to my butt.

696
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,969
Be strong.

697
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:01,972
Love your daughter.

698
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:04,497
Love yourself.

699
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:01,125
So...

700
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:04,601
think you can do what
Sister Peter Marie said,

701
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:08,264
- not think of Oz?
- Yeah.

702
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:12,605
Prisoner 97B41 2 is dead.

703
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:14,611
l'm leaving
all his shit behind.

704
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,055
And then they asked me about
defecating on Schillinger's face

705
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:38,527
and biting off the tip
of Robson's penis.

706
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:42,692
l'm not sure my answers
really satisfied them.

707
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:53,772
- Well?
- l'm sorry Tobias, they voted no.

708
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:59,638
They were impressed by the progress
you made over the past few months,

709
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:02,880
but didn't feel it balanced all the bad
behavior from before.

710
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:09,383
Fucking Christ.

711
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:13,089
l am so sorry that l painted
such a rosy outcome.

712
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,690
l am completely
and utterly in shock.

713
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:17,963
l'm sure you did
the very best you could.

714
00:49:18,002 --> 00:49:20,869
They did say that they be open
to another hearing in a year.

715
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,565
A year?

716
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:26,769
Another year.

717
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,778
Fucking Oz.

718
00:49:28,812 --> 00:49:30,905
Tobias.

719
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,577
- Take me to my cell?
- Stay here and talk for a minute.

720
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:37,348
Later.
l want to be alone.

721
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:26,759
Beecher.

722
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:31,138
l am so glad that you and l get
to interact some more.

723
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,138
Get the fuck
away from me.

724
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:36,942
Now, now,
don't be bitter.

725
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,806
Let's kiss
and make up, huh?

726
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:47,288
l warned you
to keep away from him.

727
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,693
No!

728
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:53,526
He's mine.

729
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:00,793
Adebisi lives.

730
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:14,349
Okay, Vern, l need you
to move your foot.

731
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:17,354
Can you move your feet?
Start him on an lV.

732
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,982
- Motherfucker!
- l need some more right now.

733
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:22,890
- Okay, it's okay. Move your hand.
- Fuck!

734
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:04,465
''l want to go back
to my old home before l die.

735
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:07,937
l asked the great white Father
to allow me to go back.

736
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:09,962
But He said 'No.'''

737
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,441
Geronimo.

738
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,919
Didn't l tell you all
motherfuckers?

739
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,760
Cable is the best!

740
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:36,766
O'Reily.
O'Reily!

741
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,463
- What?!
- A package.

742
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,902
- That's the wristwatch?
- Yeah.

743
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:51,915
Last piece we need
for the bomb.

744
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:55,146
- We're gonna detonate during rec hour?
- The best time.

745
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:59,349
The gymnasium won't take the blast
being so far from Em City.

746
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:04,660
Are you sure about this?

747
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:09,928
The US government
made me a prisoner of war.

748
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:14,336
l'm being sent back to England
for purely political reasons,

749
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:18,137
and that's wrong.
So, we have to act.

750
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:20,507
Will our single deed
create change?

751
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:22,671
Maybe.

752
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:24,772
Probably not.

753
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:27,943
So then, you're saying
it's not the battle, but the war?

754
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:33,150
l'm saying whether we ever win the war
is for God to decide.

755
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,919
For man,
there's only fighting.

756
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,291
Fight for fighting's sake.
That's so fucked up, man.

757
00:53:38,328 --> 00:53:43,425
No, fighting because injustice
must always be met head on.

758
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,867
Live like that.

759
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:52,365
We may not win,
but we ensure we never, ever lose.

760
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:01,314
- Ryan!
- Hi, kid.

761
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,751
- How you doing?
- You feel all right?

762
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:05,186
Yeah.

763
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:20,766
Hey, l can't thank you enough for
getting Cyril sent back to me.

764
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:23,034
l didn't transfer
him for you, Ryan.

765
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:25,132
l did it 'cause
it's the right thing to do.

766
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,234
No, l-- l know that,
you know,

767
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:29,837
'cause you always do
the right thing, the moral thing.

768
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,713
That's why l love you.
Kiss me.

769
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:38,787
Officer!

770
00:54:40,624 --> 00:54:42,524
Take O'Reily
back to Em City.

771
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,494
Hey, l didn't mean
to upset you, you know?

772
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:50,023
All l meant to say was l got every
reason to live now, every reason.

773
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,017
Hey--

774
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:10,986
We got to talk. Look, we got to call
this operation off.

775
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:14,013
For fuck's sake, keep your voice down.
We'll discuss this later.

776
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:15,957
No, later's going
to be too late.

777
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:18,120
We're going to end up
killing a lot of people

778
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:20,789
- that shouldn't have to die.
- We've been through this.

779
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,856
Em City will be nearly empty.

780
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:24,366
l'll get word to the COs.

781
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:26,892
They'll have five minutes
for further evacuation.

782
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:28,905
No. What if the hacks
don't act fast enough?

783
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:30,304
l can't control that.

784
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,308
What if the blast
spreads to other areas,

785
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:35,175
other cell blocks, maybe even
the hospital, the visiting rooms?

786
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:37,772
There's nothing else
can be done.

787
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:42,774
No. Look, l-- l've killed anybody
for just about anything.

788
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:46,220
So l-- l'm not going to try to get all
high and mighty on you.

789
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:49,157
l know that this mission
makes sense to you.

790
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:52,423
But for me, l see
what we're about to do,

791
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:55,431
and for the first time
in my miserable, fucking life,

792
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,490
l feel like
l finally understand.

793
00:55:57,534 --> 00:55:59,695
Understand?
Understand what?

794
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:02,398
Our actions, they
make us who we are.

795
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:06,466
And up to now, my actions don't amount
to a pile of shit.

796
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,308
Hey, Jesus Christ, Padraig,
l've got a brother

797
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:13,339
and even a woman inside
these walls who believe in me.

798
00:56:13,383 --> 00:56:17,479
They believed in me
when l gave them nothing to believe in.

799
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:21,184
One hour from now, we're going
to complete our mission.

800
00:56:21,224 --> 00:56:24,523
- Fuck you!
- What are you doing?

801
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:27,462
l've always been the guy who walked
tall, held his head high,

802
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:31,524
but that's always
just been a move, for show.

803
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:34,901
For once, l'm going to earn
the right to walk that way.

804
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:40,267
Hey, excuse me.

805
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,710
l need to go back to Em City.
l got an emergency.

806
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,907
O'Reily, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

807
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:46,848
You left the fucking
gas on again.

808
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:49,044
- Well, turn it off!
- No, you turn it off.

809
00:56:49,086 --> 00:56:52,749
Where you going? Hey, l ain't gonna do
your fucking job for you.

810
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,870
Uh-huh. No. l'm taking this fucking
bomb to the hacks.

811
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:15,002
Relax, Ryan.
lt took me a minute,

812
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:16,740
but what you said
in the cafeteria

813
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,340
is starting to penetrate
this thick skull of mine.

814
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:22,374
Yeah? Jesus. Look,
that's good, Padraig,

815
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:24,478
because we could
still fight the good fight.

816
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:27,251
We just got to figure out
a different way to do it. All right?

817
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,316
Careful.
Did you shut off the time delay?

818
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,920
- No, l haven't done anything.
- Give me it.

819
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:40,231
Hey, what are you doing?

820
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,262
What must be done.
You've two minutes.

821
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:45,467
No, Padraig-- fuck!

822
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:50,176
Cyril, beat it!
McManus!

823
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,204
- McManus, Murphy, he's got a bomb!
- Huh?

824
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:54,479
Down there.
Connolly's got a bomb!

825
00:57:57,487 --> 00:57:59,011
He's got a bomb!

826
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:00,920
Fucking Connolly's
got a bomb!

827
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,484
You've got exactly
one minute,

828
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:07,724
30 seconds to evacuate
Em City!

829
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:21,133
Padraig, put the bomb down.
Put it down. Let's talk.

830
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:24,113
- One minute, 15.
- Fuck!

831
00:58:24,147 --> 00:58:26,479
You. You.
Check the computer room.

832
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:29,212
You three make sure
every fucking pod is empty.

833
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:31,277
Open the gate.

834
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:39,123
Hey, Padraig, Padraig!
Cut those wires.

835
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:42,495
There's no turning back.
Less than a minute. You should go.

836
00:58:42,532 --> 00:58:44,523
No, just put it down
and we'll both go.

837
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:48,231
A foreign army still
occupies lrish streets.

838
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,205
That's all the more reason for you to
stay alive, remember?

839
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,366
To fight, remember?

840
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:54,070
l've no illusions about
what l face back in England.

841
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,169
l'll not die
on their soil.

842
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:58,181
l end here.

843
00:58:58,215 --> 00:59:00,240
- O'Reily! Come on, let's go!
- 20 seconds!

844
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:02,274
- Ryan!
- God damn you, Padraig!

845
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:14,262
10 seconds!

846
00:59:14,297 --> 00:59:16,265
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

847
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:19,268
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

848
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:21,736
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

849
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:23,739
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

850
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,952
Oh, Christ almighty.

851
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,208
How soon
till detonation?

852
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:01,574
lt should have
gone off by now.

853
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:04,102
Fucking piece
of shite!

854
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,182
lt's a dud.

855
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,882
- lt's a fucking dud.
- Go get him.

856
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:32,667
Maybe what we say when we go is less
important than what's said about us.

857
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:36,475
When you die, what's the nicest thing
someone will utter about you?

858
01:00:36,513 --> 01:00:38,174
What's the worst?

859
01:00:38,214 --> 01:00:41,672
Somewhere in-between
is who you are.

860
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:46,314
Or maybe mere words aren't
enough to define a life.

861
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:49,883
Maybe only
one's actions can.
