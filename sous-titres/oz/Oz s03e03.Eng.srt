1
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,143
L used to be a runner.

2
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:42,807
Not a marathoner, a runner.

3
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,181
Marathons are bullshit. They're all hype.

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,052
Some official picks a random day...

5
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,488
and rain or cold,
you're out pounding the pavement...

6
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,992
alongside 50,000 other dumb fucks.

7
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:58,220
No, there are some things
that's better to do all by yourself.

8
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,363
O'Brien.

9
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,805
Bevilaqua.

10
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,408
Alvarez.

11
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,574
Holy shit!

12
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,652
Alvarez, can you hear me?

13
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,495
L told you this would happen!

14
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:37,635
Yes, you're very smart.

15
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,470
We'll miss you when you're gone.

16
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,265
The question is, will Alvarez live?

17
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,836
- Yes.
- Then let's all relax.

18
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,103
Relax?

19
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,013
Leo, just because Alvarez
is going to be okay...

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,381
doesn't mean we're going to be
so lucky next time.

21
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,819
Dr. Garvey, the next inmate
you deprive of medication...

22
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,722
simply because it's expensive, may die.

23
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:03,758
The Weigert Corporation was contracted
to provide health care...

24
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,130
to the state prison system
for the purpose of keeping costs down.

25
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,326
My job is to make judgment calls.

26
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:15,035
According to the deal Weigert made
with the governor...

27
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,099
l have complete autonomy.

28
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:21,743
And l will not have that autonomy broached
under any circumstances.

29
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,210
Well...

30
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,189
Leo, this is bullshit.

31
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,658
He's right. L have no authority over him.

32
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:35,354
So what do we do?

33
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:39,696
Go public.

34
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,868
If there's anything else l can do,
let me know.

35
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,669
- I will.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,110
Who's that?

37
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:57,643
Rick Donn, <i>Channel 2 News</i>.
He wants to interview you about Alvarez.

38
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,575
- You didn't tell him anything about...
- Yes, l did.

39
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:03,817
L figure since you gave me
two weeks' notice, l got nothing to lose.

40
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,053
L'll tell them you're nothing
but a disgruntled employee.

41
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,894
You can do that, sure.

42
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,258
Maybe they'll believe you,
maybe this will all blow over.

43
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,631
But when l'm gone,
and the next screw-up happens...

44
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:19,763
maybe this time someone dies,
you won't have anyone to blame then.

45
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:25,008
If l were you, l'd switch to a red tie.
It'll look better on camera.

46
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:37,287
Hello. Is he in?

47
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,883
This is an emergency.

48
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,551
Come in.

49
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,229
Dr. Nathan.

50
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,469
L have a problem, Gloria.

51
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,902
This situation with an inmate,
Miguel Alvarez.

52
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,808
Rick Donn called my office
wanting an interview...

53
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:00,846
wanting to ask how l thought
things were going with Weigert.

54
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,940
L then received a call from Ross Tavoli,
the CEO of Medmore...

55
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,247
which is the parent company of Weigert.

56
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,049
Ross is an old friend.

57
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,646
A very generous friend.

58
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,859
- Governor...
- You haven't gone on camera yet, have you?

59
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:18,561
- No, l haven't.
- Good. Here's what l propose.

60
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:22,398
You keep your job,
Alvarez goes back on the medication...

61
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,999
and Weigert agrees
to loosen up the purse strings.

62
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,540
And Garvey?

63
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:32,103
He's gone.

64
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:34,874
Turns out, in the '70s
he was a back-alley abortionist.

65
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,678
A woman he was servicing died on the table.

66
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,618
He moved here,
sued to have his license restored, and won.

67
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,314
Don't ask me how.

68
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:47,790
In any case, l'm sure Rick Donn will be more
than satisfied with that exclusive...

69
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,319
and allow the rest of the story
to die a natural death.

70
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,834
People tell me you're a reasonable person.

71
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,036
Be reasonable now.
Give me your cooperation.

72
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:07,110
L want to stay...

73
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,843
but l need to know
that things are really going to be different.

74
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,952
You have my solemn word.

75
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:24,123
<i>Garvey resigned today</i>
<i>amidst the controversy.</i>

76
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:28,224
<i>Governor Devlin said he would hold Weigert</i>
<i>Corporation accountable for its actions.</i>

77
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:32,067
<i>A spokesman for Weigert said they had</i>
<i>no knowledge of Garvey's prior record...</i>

78
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,436
<i>and have promised a re-evaluation</i>
<i>of their policy...</i>

79
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,668
<i>for correctional facilities nationwide.</i>

80
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,239
Miguel?

81
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,413
Am l dead?

82
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,076
Am l in heaven?

83
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,152
Not quite.

84
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,048
Shit.

85
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,421
You should have let me die.

86
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:29,120
<i>Prisoner number 99S233...</i>

87
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,755
<i>Nikolai Stanislofsky.</i>

88
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,330
<i>Convicted February 14, '99.</i>

89
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
<i>Possession of stolen goods</i>
<i>with intent to sell.</i>

90

Sentence: 15 years.

91
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,033
Up for parole in 5.

92
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:49,076
- You a Russian?
- Yes.

93
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:53,080
- From Russia?
- Yes.

94
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,722
- You were born in Russia?
- Yes.

95
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:00,583
- First time in Oz?
- Only time.

96
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,218
You'll get used to it.

97
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:05,856
L was seven years in Soviet gulag.
This place is cake.

98
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,163
Who's the girl?

99
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,427
That's Miss Sally.

100
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,700
Look at those fucking tits.

101
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:25,377
Tell me, are we anywhere close
to death row?

102
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,476
Yeah, why? You know somebody
on death row?

103
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,080
A man l knew...

104
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,152
Alexander Vogel, was killed.

105
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,664
L would like to shake the hand
of the man who murdered him.

106
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,722
That'd be Richie Hanlon.

107
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,526
Richie Hanlon.

108
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,440
Richie.

109
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:01,943
Hon? Hold up your arm, will you?

110
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:05,949
For the sweater.

111
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,558
What do you think, about four bars?

112
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,930
Three.

113
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:23,934
Mail!

114
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,718
Long time no see, Vern.

115
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,051
- Did you miss me?
- Breathlessly.

116
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,318
Got that teapot you ordered.

117
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,719
Thanks, darling.

118
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,860
My, you are turning this cell
into quite the little nest.

119
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:51,370
My new lawyer is taking my appeal
to the State Supreme Court.

120
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:55,396
- I figure l'll be here a while longer.
- That is good news.

121
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,133
Yeah.

122
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:06,777
Hello, Richie. Nothing for you today.

123
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:10,589
Guess all your little fag friends are too busy
getting their legs waxed.

124
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:13,854
- Fuck you, "Schillinjer."
- "Schillinger," asshole.

125
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,666
What's this thing between you and Vern?

126
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:27,103
Every time he comes around here,
you boys snarl at each other.

127
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,538
Long story.

128
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:32,143
L've got no other appointments today.

129
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,185
That bastard is the reason l'm on death row.

130
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,723
He and another Aryan creep
killed a Russian.

131
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,750
Hung him by his ankles in the gym...

132
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,355
carved "Jew" on his chest...

133
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,428
and then told me if l didn't confess
to the murder, they'd kill me.

134
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,597
Death sentence either way.

135
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,235
But if you know you're gonna die,
why not tell the truth?

136
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,179
The other one, Mark Mack, is already dead.

137
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,110
Besides, why should the hacks listen
to me now?

138
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:17,890
L tell them Schillinger did it,
they'd say, "Prove it."

139
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,025
- I have no proof.
- Unless you say you did it together.

140
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,498
- What?
- Lie.

141
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,197
Tell them you and Vern
both killed the Russian.

142
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,300
- How does that save me?
- It doesn't, honey.

143
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:39,970
But it does mean his ass will be sitting up
here in the cell next to yours.

144
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:45,978
Something to consider, Richie.
Just something to consider.

145
00:11:56,763 --> 00:12:00,130
Coyle, how you doing? You comfortable?

146
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,432
The fuck you care?

147
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,804
Why did you tell Hill
you murdered that family?

148
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:09,035
Why didn't you just
keep your fucking mouth shut?

149
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:14,646
You might as well be asking me why l had
Frankie go videotape me doing the deed.

150
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:19,246
Then you might as well ask me
why l even do the deed at all.

151
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:23,749
If you can't figure none of that shit out,
you don't belong here, McManus.

152
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,149
Fine, l don't belong here.

153
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,557
- Why did you tell Hill?
- Hill.

154
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,822
L mean, he different
than the other niggers in this place.

155
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,100
- I wanted his respect.
- Respect.

156
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,735
Now l want him dead.

157
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,904
You happy, McManus?

158
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:47,043
You got everything you came for?

159
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:51,315
You see, l wanted his respect,
now l want him dead.

160
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,716
It's a thin line between love and hate.

161
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:57,244
You got that, McManus? You bastard!

162
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,121
Channel 2 News <i>brings you</i>
<i>shocking evidence...</i>

163

L want to put on <i>Miss Sally's Schoolyard</i>.

174
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:38,757
- Yeah, Miss Sally's got big bazooms.
- Big bazooms.

175
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,295
Settle down, Cyril.

176
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,731
You gotta jab her right there.

177
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:47,773
- They put Hill in protective custody.
- That ain't gonna save his rat ass.

178
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,138
He gonna pay for what he did to Snake.

179
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,746
<i>The grand jury had me</i>
<i>going around in circles.</i>

180
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,338
You did great.

181
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,280
Besides, they saw the videotape.

182
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:01,286
Coyle's gonna get indicted, then convicted.

183
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,784
You know the best thing
about this whole thing?

184
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:07,857
Being outside. Getting driven to the city.

185
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:12,130
The energy, the ladies.
City's got two new skyscrapers, too.

186
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:15,365
But mostly, the sense of freedom.

187
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,837
You know, being out of harm's way.

188
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,867
Wangler and those guys,
they're gonna kill me.

189
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,839
L don't blame them.

190
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:29,770
Still not sure ratting on Coyle
was the right thing to do.

191
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,680
L mean, those people are dead.

192
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,151
This trial won't bring them back.

193
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,815
Meanwhile, l'm in some deep shit.

194
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,748
We'll take care of you.

195
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,279
You all right?

196
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,810
Yeah. L got the flu. Go on with
what you were saying about Hill.

197
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:10,952
Nobody likes a snitch.

198
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:14,481
That's true, but we're going to put that aside
for the moment.

199
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,996
What l am doing
is appealing to your sense of conscience.

200
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:22,498
All of you here,
you have committed murder...

201
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,070
but in the course of conducting business.

202
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,003
It's true, this is different.

203
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:32,067
You're all family men.
Coyle's murdering of an innocent family...

204
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,113
threatens your families on the outside, too.

205
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,640
What do you want, Said?

206
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,580
Help me protect Hill.

207
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,687
All of us together.

208
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,848
We make it clear to Wangler...

209
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,984
we will not tolerate any harm coming to him.

210
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:52,922
L know the Ciancimino family a little.
Nice people, never hurt a soul.

211
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,994
And the father, he died in Nam.

212
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:02,105
Nam? Count the Brotherhood in.

213
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,035
You?

214
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:08,238
Sure.

215
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,309
Nappa?

216
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,045
Not only will no one touch Hill...

217
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,553
but l'll do you one better.

218
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,772
Nappa air-holed Snake.

219
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:40,379
We got to air-hole Nappa.

220
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,581
And that cripple snitch
bitch-ass nigger Hill...

221
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,378
we got to whack his ass, too.

222
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,818
Chill, yo. We can't fuck with
either one of them right now.

223
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,089
We have the fucking Sicilians...

224
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,391
the Muslims, the Aryan motherfuckers...

225
00:16:57,463 --> 00:17:00,398
and the spics all over our dicks.
We gotta chill.

226
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,000
So what we gonna do?
Let them disrespect us like that?

227
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,705
Disrespect? Fuck that.

228
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,808
We just gotta wait for the right time...

229
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:14,209
and then we'll nail both their asses
to the fucking wall.

230
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,373
- You heard?
- Word.

231
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,759
Okay, Ricardo...

232
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,565
you think you could behave yourself now?

233
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,883
- Where's lsabella?
- The baby's keeping her busy.

234
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:55,477
She thought maybe he was coming down
with the flu.

235
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,249
Yeah, the flu.

236
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,985
<i>Papi</i>, you told me you'd never lie to me.

237
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,959
The baby has been sick.

238
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,959
It's nothing serious.

239
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,461
Juan told her she had to stay home.

240
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,762
That cocksucker never liked me.

241
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:12,099
- Since l fucked his cousin at the wedding.
- You fucked his cousin?

242
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,072
She gave me a little head in the men's room.
Juan walked in.

243
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:18,133
- They've been arguing a lot.
- I told her not to marry him.

244
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,110
About her coming here.

245
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:23,505
She said for now
she won't be visiting you anymore.

246
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:26,881
She doesn't want to end up divorced
and with a baby.

247
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,510
Fuck her then.

248
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:32,148
No, fuck her and that <i>cabrón</i> she married.

249
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:35,421
No, Pop, l'm dead to them.
Okay, she's dead to me.

250
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,894
You tell that bitch
she's fucking dead to me...

251
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:40,796
and l don't want to hear
her fucking name again!

252
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:55,080
"Hitting the wall." That's what they call it.

253
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:59,841
The moment when you can't take it anymore,
when you've pushed yourself...

254
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,083
and strained every muscle,
when you think if you go one more step...

255
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,215
your body will implode.

256
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:23,899
- What do you want?
- Sometimes it's good to pray.

257
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:27,174
When you're unhappy, ask God for his help.

258
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,410
We can pray together.

259
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,582
Pray l don't cut you right now.

260
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,752
- Drop the knife!
- Why don't you come and take it?

261
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:43,254
L got a Code 19.

262
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,698
Give me that!

263
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,599
You got no balls. You got no fucking balls!

264
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:18,392
You writing poetry?

265
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,896
- Man, l don't do that shit no more.
- Why?

266
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:28,238
'Cause l don't feel like it, all right?
L just don't feel like it.

267
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,502
Too bad. You wrote good.

268
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,674
Adebisi, leave me the fuck alone, please.

269
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,124
- Here you go, Brother Minister.
- Thank you.

270
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:51,558
You've been on this hunger strike
for four days now.

271
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,565
We've had no reaction
from McManus or Glynn.

272
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:57,630
That's because they think l'm bluffing.

273
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,137
But soon they will see.

274
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,768
Don't worry, brother.

275
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,504
This hunger strike won't last much longer.

276
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,445
The judge has accepted
our class action suit.

277
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,613
That is excellent.

278
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:14,312
- So when does the trial begin?
- Two months.

279
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,820
- That long?
- Justice moves slowly.

280
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:19,990
If it moves at all.

281
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:25,363
Wait. There is one more thing.

282
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:29,127
L want you to pay a visit to the warden.

283
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,268
This hunger strike started
because you wouldn't allow Said...

284
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:35,432
to have food in his cell at night
so he could fast during the day.

285
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:37,702
L won't grant him special status.

286
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:41,337
As of tomorrow,
two more Muslims will stop eating.

287
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,142
Day after that, three more will stop...

288
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:46,878
and so on until every Muslim in Oz...

289
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:51,352
until every Muslim in every prison
in this state is on a hunger strike.

290
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:54,085
L'm not the State's Attorney,
but l guess he'd say...

291
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,027
that the last thing you need right now
on top of a class action suit...

292
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:01,362
is a prison system full of men
dying for their faith.

293
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:04,163
Bad press, bad karma, gentlemen.

294
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,340
L say we let Said have his way.

295
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,379
Leo, you give in now...

296
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:18,439
what'll stop him from using a hunger strike
the next time he makes demands?

297
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:22,954
We'll deal with "the next time" the next time.
Hopefully, this lawsuit will be settled.

298
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:26,219
You let him win, his stature only grows.
We lose.

299
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,058
Sometimes the only way to win is to lose.

300
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,793
What l don't get are these treadmills.

301
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:12,462
These people that just want
to run on a machine.

302
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,299
Sure, you drop a few pounds...

303
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:17,934
you tighten some sinews,
but you still haven't gone anywhere.

304
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,203
It's like being a hamster
in one of them circly things in a cage.

305
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:23,804
Me?

306
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:26,707
L don't wanna be a hamster no more.

307
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:31,178
Hi.

308
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,559
Tim, about the other day...

309
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:36,924
- You don't...
- Let me.

310
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,986
L completely overreacted.

311
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,962
Diane Wittlesey's mother died,
you comfort her...

312
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:45,595
and l make it into this big thing
like you're still in love with her.

313
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:48,299
L'm a fucking cloying bitch, is that it?

314
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,006
- Let go of me.
- Stop! Calm down.

315
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:55,376
L was wrong. L'm an idiot. L'm sorry.

316
00:23:57,182 --> 00:24:00,447
All l want is for us to be back
to the way we were.

317
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,854
Don't you see? We weren't anywhere.

318
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,320
L'm sorry if l misled you...

319
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:14,189
but you came on to me like gangbusters.
L didn't think the sex would mean that much.

320
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:18,029
L'm not looking for a serious relationship.

321
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,834
The truth is l'm shit at commitment
except to my job.

322
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,841
If l wanted to be married,
l would still be married.

323
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,311
Walk away!

324
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:38,818
- L'm not asking you to marry me.
- I know.

325
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,325
- I just wanna be friends.
- Okay, friends.

326
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:43,486
And the sex will just be the sex.

327
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:47,193
- I don't think that we should fuck anymore.
- Why not?

328
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,894
- Because fucking complicates things.
- It doesn't have to.

329
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,198
Yes, it does. It always does.

330
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:54,795
L promise, it won't.

331
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:58,001
- That's not a promise you can make or keep.
- I can.

332
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:00,044
- No.
- What?

333
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,947
You don't think l'm any good in bed?

334
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,380
Oh, shit!

335
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,647
- Claire...
- Don't!

336
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,519
You know, you're not so amazing yourself.

337
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:16,960
Maybe the reason you can't commit is
you'd rather suck off one of these guys.

338
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,924
L'm sorry, am l hitting a nerve?

339
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:23,024
- No, you're boring me.
- Cocksucker!

340
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:37,274
Giles.

341
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,982
Bevilaqua.

342
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:48,725
- What are you doing?
- Come in here, Howell. Nice tits.

343
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:04,165
Twice in one week, Leo. On her watch.

344
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:07,076
Alvarez almost offs himself and now this.

345
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,941
- She's new.
- She's dangerous.

346
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,718
Bevilaqua may have
permanent brain damage.

347
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,413
- L'll transfer her to another unit.
- No, Leo.

348
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:19,252
Fire her now. Fucking fire her!

349
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:43,140
Can l have your attention, please?

350
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,448
Gentlemen.

351
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:57,190
This is Officer Sean Murphy,
the new supervisor in Emerald City.

352
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,697
L've read the files on each of you.

353
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:03,292
L know you're tough. Life in Oz sucks.

354
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:07,769
This l also know.
Don't force me to make the days even worse.

355
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:09,835
"Sean Murphy."

356
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:14,009
- He's a mick, like us.
- That's good?

357
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,411
Little brother,
things are definitely looking up.

358
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:28,952
- Hello, buttercup.
- Fuck it! You're fucking dead, man!

359
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,590
You're dead, Schillinger.
You are fucking dead.

360
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:39,566
You are fucking mine, motherfucker!

361
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,709
L'm gonna need a refill there, sweet cheeks.

362
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:57,483
You send me to the hole,
my brother's fair game for Schillinger.

363
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:01,788
Boo-fucking-hoo. You should've thought
of that before you lost your temper.

364
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:04,656
L'm sorry.

365
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:10,661
- Tim, mind if l handle this?
- No, go ahead. L can't reach him.

366
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,470
All right, let's go.

367
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,003
Okay, O'Reily, l'm gonna let this pass. Once.

368
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:25,775
You fuck up again,
l'll personally stomp your ass.

369
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:28,517
- Why are you being so nice?
- Your file.

370
00:28:28,587 --> 00:28:33,320
L know all about you and your brother.
L got brothers, l know what it's like.

371
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:38,660
Besides, you and me,
we're both Black lrish, right?

372
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,022
Black as they come.

373
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,361
- You were Golden Gloves.
- How did you hear that?

374
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:47,530
You read my file, l read yours.
L bet you pack quite a punch.

375
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:51,872
Yeah, l had my day, sure.
My face hit the canvas just as often.

376
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:54,474
You know, my brother Cyril, he's a boxer.

377
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:57,982
And l entered him into this competition
that McManus is organizing.

378
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,449
L thought your brother was slow.

379
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:02,578
Yeah, day to day, but in the ring...
Man, he's so fast.

380
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:05,919
It's like his instincts just come right back,
you know.

381
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:09,619
But the problem is,
l don't know dick about boxing.

382
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:14,121
So l was just wondering,
maybe you might wanna coach Cyril.

383
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:15,563
- Me?
- Yeah.

384
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:18,402
No way, O'Reily.
That would be showing favoritism.

385
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,097
L don't mean like full-on coaching...

386
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:24,575
but l mean maybe just kind of watch him
at a distance, you know. Give me pointers.

387
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:28,108
- For lreland?
- We'll see, kid.

388
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:14,347
Quiet!

389
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,989
Everybody shut up, please.

390
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,924
Quiet down so we can get started.

391
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,169
It's the first Oswald boxing championships.
We've eliminated weight classes.

392
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:36,948
In this corner in the blue trunks,
Chucky "The Enforcer" Pancamo.

393
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:46,622
And in this corner,
"Throttling" Steve Pasquin.

394
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:04,367
L want you to keep it clean. No punches
below the belt, no rabbit punches.

395
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:05,739
You obey me at all times.

396
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,711
Protect yourselves, go to your corners,
shake hands.

397
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:27,421
Ring the bell.

398
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:09,100
Hey, Ryan, how's Cyril?

399
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:11,267
Officer...

400
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:15,777
- get these two fucks away from me.
- He is so touchy.

401
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:21,017
L was just coming over to tell you
how excited l am that Cyril's first fight...

402
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:25,455
- is gonna be against James here.
- That's right, Cyril and me.

403
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:29,182
And you can't do a fucking thing about it.

404
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:36,162
Beecher bit off the tip of your dick.
How would you like to lose the rest?

405
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,260
Move along, O'Reily.

406
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:48,436
COs, odds are 5-to-1 in your favor.

407
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,889
- Ryan.
- Aunt Brenda.

408
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:13,465
- What did you bring?
- Your favorites.

409
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:18,074
No!

410
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:23,271
- You're in training.
- In training? For what?

411
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,541
A fight. They organized a boxing match.

412
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,717
Ryan, no. You can't have the boy boxing.

413
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,484
Why not?

414
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,819
His brain's rattled enough.

415
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:38,953
Sweetheart, do you want to box?

416
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:41,356
What are you asking him that for?

417
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,402
'Cause l know how you bully him
into doing the things you want.

418
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:45,731
Fuck you.

419
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:47,801
No, fuck you!

420
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:50,767
What, all of a sudden now
you're worried about Cyril?

421
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,743
L've always been worried about him.
L worry about both of you.

422
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:57,748
Oh, yeah? Then where the fuck were you
when we were growing up?

423
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:02,082
Where were you when that shithead
was beating on us? On Ma?

424
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:06,089
You were off at your goddamn Mass
while l protected Cyril. Me!

425
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:09,058
You took care of him all right.
You took care of him good.

426
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:12,528
'Cause of you his mind is muddled.
'Cause of you he's in this hellhole.

427
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:15,828
Listen, do us a favor, you old bitch,
and drop fucking dead.

428
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,924
Come on, Cyril.

429
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,993
You got the devil in you, Ryan.
Just like your father.

430
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,341
Come on, Cyril.

431
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:32,544
Move it!

432
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,258
Cyril's got the next fight.

433
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,769
- Who's he up against?
- Robson.

434
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:57,801
Watched Robson train. He's tough.
But he keeps his left real low.

435
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:01,243
- Tell your brother to hook him.
- Yeah, but is that gonna be enough?

436
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:03,872
L mean, l don't want Cyril
getting any more damaged.

437
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,176
Pull him out.

438
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:10,181
No fucking way. There's gotta be something
else l can do to give him an edge.

439
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,819
- You know the story of the Black lrish?
- No.

440
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:17,418
Back in the 1600s,
after the Armada was defeated...

441
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:20,960
Spanish sailors washed up
on the shores of lreland.

442
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:25,827
Couldn't speak a word of English.
They figured out how to survive.

443
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,967
Survival. It's in your blood, O'Reily.

444
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,641
You'll figure out something.

445
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:54,789
So how come you Christians
don't got nobody boxing?

446
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:59,834
We made a decision not to participate.
Morally wrong.

447
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:00,893
Right.

448
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,475
You still working bedpan duty
in the hospital ward?

449
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:06,942
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

450
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:10,610
You want to make a little extra cash?

451
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,676
Maybe.

452
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,012
What are you doing?

453
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,448
Shut the fuck up.

454
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,281
How you feeling? Feeling good?

455
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:58,153
Good round. Gotta keep jabbing.
Don't rely on that right all the time.

456
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:00,213
Watch your body, work your jab.

457
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:03,558
It's all good, man. Come on.

458
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:23,170
Come on. Sit down.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

459
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:26,267
You got 15 pounds on this guy.
He's treating you like a rag doll.

460
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:28,312
Take a drink.

461
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,212
James, one more drink.
Looks good. Come on.

462
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:36,114
You got your ass kicked.

463
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:41,749
What the fuck are you looking at?
Get your eyes off the ring. Take a drink.

464
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:44,919
Nice, man.
You're fucking kicking the shit out of him.

465
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:47,760
One more round for the Brotherhood.
Let's go.

466
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,007
<i>When you're in a race, you wanna win.</i>

467
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:37,572
<i>You wanna win no matter what it takes.</i>

468
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,445
<i>Win at all costs.</i>

469
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:42,842
Fuck you.

470
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:47,852
L was a sprinter.
Yeah, l was great with the short distance.

471
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,220
Man, you shoot that starting gun off
and l would go! Fast!

472
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:57,364
Man, l could travel the 50-yard dash
in 6.5 seconds. No shit.

473
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,027
L came at it natural.

474
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:02,937
In my 'hood, you had to learn to run
before you learned to walk.

475
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:08,368
Officer Murphy?

476
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:12,542
L'm supposed to have
a dialysis treatment now.

477
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,714
You're wrong, Rebadow.
It's not listed on today's sheet.

478
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,824
When l had my last appointment,
Dr. Nathan told the medical assistant...

479
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:26,694
- to schedule another one for this morning.
- Maybe Nathan changed her mind.

480
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:28,527
L'll call, check it out.

481
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:32,591
All l got down here
is you having visiting hours at 3:00.

482
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,840
- My mother is coming.
- Your mother?

483
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:41,336
- Are you sick?
- No, mama.

484
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:47,383
- You were never a very good liar.
- I have diabetes.

485
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:52,517
We seem to be getting our share
of bad diagnoses these days.

486
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:55,557
What with little Alex's leukemia.

487
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,656
L got the picture you sent of him
in SeaWorld.

488
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:03,828
That trip. L can't tell you,
it did him so much good.

489
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:09,704
After SeaWorld, he was glowing.
Now he's starting to falter again.

490
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:13,406
L wish there was more l could do.

491
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,978
There is. Meet him.

492
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,319
- No.
- He's your grandchild.

493
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:24,354
Mama, no.

494
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:27,488
L told them the truth about you.

495
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:31,123
- What?
- I know.

496
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:33,955
L broke my word.

497
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:38,991
But for Christ's sakes, you've never seen
your own son, your own grandson.

498
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:43,435
All these years, all the lies...

499
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,002
telling them you died years ago.

500
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:50,571
L don't want to go to my grave knowing that
some promise l made 30 years ago...

501
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:52,479
kept you from your family.

502
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:56,877
Meeting them won't do any good.

503
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:01,248
Not meeting them
hasn't done any good either.

504
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:07,260
Here you go, Rebadow.
Diabetes Diet Delight.

505
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:08,696
Hurry, Rebadow.

506
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:11,894
- L'm going as fast as l can.
- Hurry before Schillinger shows.

507
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:15,268
Every day, every meal,
he spits in my food and makes me eat it.

508
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:17,637
- So spit in Schillinger's food.
- Are you kidding?

509
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,108
He'd yank out my salivary glands.

510
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:21,508
Busmalis.

511
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,302
Too late.

512
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:41,930
Wanna trade?

513
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:52,200
He's in shock.

514
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,744
IV bolus of DF-50.

515
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:57,007
- Did he go to dialysis today?
- He...

516
00:43:57,848 --> 00:43:59,816
What? Didn't l tell you to schedule him?

517
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:02,580
- I forgot.
- You forgot?

518
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:05,212
He could have died, you asshole.

519
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:24,368
You feeling better?

520
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,300
Quite a scare.

521
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:32,338
Is there anything else l can do for you?

522
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,381
May l use the phone?

523
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:52,364
L've changed my mind.

524
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:41,512
- Adebisi, you just pinch me?
- No, boss.

525
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:49,917
L know what you did. You said
Dr. Nathan wanted to take my blood...

526
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:53,292
but l know you used it to infect someone.

527
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,857
You know it's true.

528
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:02,370
You pricked some prick with a needle,
hoping to give him AIDS.

529
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:05,236
Who is it?

530
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,837
Come on, Adebisi, tell me. Who?

531
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,015
You are delirious.

532
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:20,187
Adebisi, l don't get it.

533
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:25,222
Why would you want
to transfer out of the cafeteria...

534
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:27,628
to take care of a bunch of fags?

535
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,560
- Don't like fags?
- What do you think?

536
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,264
Out there, l hated them.

537
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,540
But here...

538
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:42,805
sometimes you need your dick sucked.

539
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,338
That's one of the many differences
between you and me.

540
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,476
L got self-control.

541
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,187
L wish l was more like you.

542
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:54,285
To me...

543
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:57,387
a fag is a fag.

544
00:46:57,728 --> 00:47:01,721
A perverted sick animal.
L can't stand having one of them near me.

545
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:10,667
But you Sicilians,
you kiss each other on the cheek.

546
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:16,004
- That's respect, not sex.
- Respect.

547
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:19,048
L got you, boss.

548
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:36,160
L got the results back from your test.

549
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:43,903
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- Be straight.

550
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:47,372
You're HIV-positive.

551
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:51,338
- What?
- L'm sorry.

552
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:56,481
Doctor, that is not possible. Correct me
if l'm wrong, but the only way to get AIDS...

553
00:47:56,554 --> 00:48:01,491
is by having sex or sharing a needle.
L haven't done either, and l'm not Haitian.

554
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,325
- You don't have AIDS, you're HIV-positive.
- The tests are wrong.

555
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:08,221
- I double-checked.
- Triple-check.

556
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:11,926
- I know this is hard for you to accept.
- It's impossible.

557
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:17,204
Antonio, l'm going to schedule you
for counseling.

558
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,765
- And make arrangements for your transfer...
- Transfer?

559
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:21,174
State policy.

560
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:25,238
All inmates who test positive for HIV
have to be isolated in one place.

561
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,677
L want to talk to the warden.

562
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:31,782
All right.

563
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:36,655
This isn't happening to me.

564
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:42,456
Skipper, l don't get it.

565
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,524
Somebody must have monkeyed
with the tests.

566
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:48,038
All l know for sure is
Glynn says l gotta move to E.

567
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:52,273
- You mean we're not gonna see you?
- That's what isolated means, Chucky.

568
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,278
Inmates in E,
they don't mingle with gen pop.

569
00:48:57,114 --> 00:49:00,948
Until l get back, you're in charge. Okay?

570
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:18,198
See you, boss.

571
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:33,105
Fuck.

572
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,509
Lights out!

573
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:52,534
Dr. Nathan says you'll be back
in Em City by the end of the day.

574
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:55,595
Good. My bedsores got bedsores.

575
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:59,397
You know, given the fact that
you had two stab wounds in the back...

576
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:01,838
l'd say your recovery is miraculous.

577
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:05,109
They'll need a lot more than
some shank to take me out.

578
00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:08,513
- You still have no idea who they are.
- No.

579
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,121
It was dark. They came at me from behind.

580
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:15,485
They're chicken shits.

581
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,891
The problem is...

582
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:22,763
we know Schillinger stabbed you.

583
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,365
Or had somebody do it.

584
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:28,938
- But we have no proof.
- Don't you just hate that?

585
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:34,607
- You don't seem very torn up by this.
- You got shot in that riot, right?

586
00:50:35,746 --> 00:50:38,237
That little handshake with death...

587
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:41,983
kind of changes your perspective on things.

588
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:48,147
L have every right to snitch out Schillinger,
he's got every right to come after me.

589
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:51,122
- Mail.
- Ain't that right, Vern?

590
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:55,364
Nothing for you today, Keller.

591
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:59,495
No get-well cards, no floral bouquets...

592
00:51:00,137 --> 00:51:02,071
not even a funeral wreath.

593
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,404
- We know you're responsible, Schillinger.
- Me?

594
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:09,212
L'll admit metaphorically it fits.

595
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:12,682
He stabbed me in the back,
so l stabbed him.

596
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:15,007
But l didn't.

597
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,054
L wish to Christ l had.

598
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:23,015
Of course, if it had been me, you'd be dead.

599
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:26,559
Godspeed.

600
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:35,029
- Thanks for seeing me, Sister.
- That's why God made office hours.

601
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:42,205
- Beecher's not around?
- No. Why? Ls this about him?

602
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:51,352
You know what went on between us, right?

603
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:57,258
L know that Tobias was in love with you
and that you broke his arms and his legs.

604
00:51:57,461 --> 00:52:01,192
Jesus Christ, you put it that way
it makes me sound so cold.

605
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:04,767
So why don't you rephrase it
so you come out the hero?

606
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:15,038
L am sorry. What l did was wrong.

607
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:18,075
And l want to make it up to him.

608
00:52:18,148 --> 00:52:23,108
L hear you've got this victim-offender
interaction program starting up.

609
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:26,981
L wanna sign up.

610
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:32,358
It takes two to swing dance.
Tobias has to be willing to participate.

611
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:36,160
L know that.
That's why l'm here. He likes you.

612
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:40,236
He respects you. If you suggest it to him...

613
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:42,932
he'll come along.

614
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,370
Do you really care about him?

615
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:53,616
You've got no reason to believe me,
but yeah.

616
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,788
Okay. L'll see what l can do.

617
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:04,993
L don't know what your scam is,
but l'm not buying it.

618
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:08,861
Seeing Sister Pete today,
asking her if we can be in her program.

619
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:13,528
No scam. It's like l've been saying,
l want to make this right between us.

620
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:17,467
How? L can't trust you.

621
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:21,568
L can't trust myself anymore.
My fucking feelings are...

622
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,882
The only thing l know for sure is this:

623
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,110
L'm gonna get Schillinger.

624
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,046
- I can help you with that.
- I don't need your help.

625
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:39,217
What are you gonna do,
you gonna get that jizzbag all by yourself?

626
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:40,695
Ask Metzger.

627
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,232
Yeah? What, you killed Metzger?

628
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:48,531
You know, when l hit Kathy Rockwell...

629
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:52,036
when l realized l had taken her life...

630
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:58,304
l was full of remorse, full of self-loathing,
because l hadn't intended to kill her.

631
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:01,250
But Metzger.

632
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:06,580
That was sweet.

633
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:10,553
You know what else was sweet?

634
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:14,062
Sticking that shank in your back.

635
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:20,634
- It was you?
- Never considered that?

636
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:24,537
Lt could've been me,
standing in the dark in that storage room...

637
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:28,135
watching you stack copying paper.
And then...

638
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:30,543
boom, boom, baby!

639
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,042
Toby, was it you?

640
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:40,780
No.

641
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,389
But for a second,
you believed it could have been.

642
00:54:45,996 --> 00:54:48,624
It could have been good old Toby.

643
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:52,864
- You didn't kill Metzger.
- No.

644
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,835
How can a little pussy bitch like me
hurt anyone?

645
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,281
Lf you weren't in the storage room...

646
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:10,843
how did you know
l was shelving copying paper?

647
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:15,091
L don't know.

648
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:19,327
Shit, maybe it was me.

649
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:23,526
L gotta pray.

650
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:27,870
Pray that God shows me the way
to fuck Schillinger.

651
00:55:35,345 --> 00:55:36,607
Number?

652
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:42,813
Nine, nine...

653
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,214
"S"...

654
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:47,085
three, three, three.

655
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:55,196
That boy's last name, know what it was?

656
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,128
Schillinger.

657
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:07,775
<i>Prisoner number 99S333.</i>

00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:10,204

<i>Convicted February 16, '99.</i>

00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:25,359

<i>possession of narcotics.</i>

661
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:28,057
Sentence: 50 years.

662
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,759
Up for parole in 20.
