1
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,131
Vikings... the word alone
conjures up images

2
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,795
of drunken hordes attacking
and pillaging defenseless villages

3
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,533
from the shores of Britain
to the steppes of Russia.

4
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,906
We got a lot of misconceptions
about the Vikings.

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,470
Example: They never actually
wore these stupid helmets,

6
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,607
and because they had a limited amount
of land on which to farm,

7
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,879
they only pillaged
to survive.

8
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,552
I wanna follow you.
You're the next wave

9
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,353
- and I wanna be your lieutenant.
- Kill Guerra.

10
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,902
What the fuck
are you doing, Jaime?

11
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,370
Sorry, bro', you gotta die.
That's just how it is.

12
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,431
Wait, at least do me in the front.
Let me die like a man.

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,309
That's how it is,
right, bro'?

14
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,794
Hey, Father.
I need to make a confession.

15
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,334
Saturday, 3:00.

16
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,168
I need
to make one now.

17
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,441
Close the door, Officer.

18
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,806
What's up?

19
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,617
You know, ever since
I've been let out of solitary,

20
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,284
I've just been going
right and left, you know,

21
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,954
up and down. Just trying to prove
to everyone that I'm no pussy.

22
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,123
I know what you mean.

23
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,793
I should have died
in that bus crash.

24
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,928
And now,
the Reverend Cloutier has...

25
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,201
disappeared,

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,572
which I think is
supposed to mean something,

27
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,978
but I can't figure out
what that something is.

28
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,143
- So what do you do?
- Pray.

29
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,981
Yeah, well,
you know...

30
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,681
toss in
a couple extra for me.

31
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,452
I always do, Miguel.

32
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,450
Yeah, well, I need just a little bit more than
my usual amount.

33
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,029
Someone died
because of me.

34
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,431
- Jaime Velez?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,769
This kid was innocent,
you know?

36
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,743
You and I have had a long
and battered relationship...

37
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,281
but I continue to believe
that you have a good soul,

38
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,409
and that you'll find a way to right
whatever wrong you committed.

39
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,818
And if I don't?

40
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,288
Then you really
are a pussy.

41
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,331
The problem is in our state

42
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,570
there are more visually-impaired people
than there are guide-dogs,

43
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,737
but there are more dogs
than there are people to train them.

44
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,339
That's why I created
this program, Man's Best Friend,

45
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,407
where prisoners
do the training.

46
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,908
- And it's worked elsewhere, huh?
- Oh, better than we'd hoped.

47
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,252
Sorry, am I late?

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,282
Well, she got here early,
so we just kind of dove in.

49
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,624
Sure, why wait
for little ol' me?

50
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,392
Alicia Hinden,
Eleanor O'Connor,

51
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,524
- the Governor's liaison.
- Nice to meet you.

52
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,034
Please, continue.

53
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,470
Having inmates care for
and train these pups

54
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,306
has been a perfect match.

55
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,074
60% of the dogs
qualify for placement,

56
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,104
90% of the prisoners
demonstrate

57
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,141
a better attitude after
their participation in the program.

58
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,281
Aren't there certain skills
necessary to train a guide-dog?

59
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,689
Of course,
but the skills are teachable.

60
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,920
And the prisoners
don't harm the animals?

61
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,758
Well, we were worried at first,
but what's happened here

62
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,925
is the dogs bring out
the best in their trainers.

63
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,265
Inmates go from having nothing
to nurturing a life.

64
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,703
It means more to them
than you can know.

65
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,003
You'll pardon me,
Miss Hinden,

66
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,307
if I'm skeptical.
I think we should start small.

67
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,780
Sure, the less people,
the less chance of success.

68
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,646
I'm not saying
the program will fail.

69
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,810
No, you're trying
to guarantee it won't last.

70
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,047
- I'm trying to save time and money.
- Yeah, right.

71
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,216
- Fuck you, Tim.
- Actually, I prefer to start small.

72
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,350
Oh, so...

73
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,123
I'll just need
three good volunteers.

74
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,562
If you're interested,
let me know, but remember

75
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,759
this isn't a few weeks
of playing fetch.

76
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,769
You gotta be strongly
motivated to participate.

77
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,967
Now the woman running the program
will interview each potential candidate,

78
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,567
review your files, and then
make her final decision.

79
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,168
That's all.

80
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,976
Shit, I don't want
no dogs in here, man.

81
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,780
You know, where I grew up, man,
there was this rott-pit bull mix,

82
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,878
mean motherfucker. I'm sure
he had some Schillinger in him.

83
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,685
He fucking took
a chunk out of my leg, man.

84
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,887
Something tells me
you deserved to get bit.

85
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:39,296
Yo, maybe a dog would take
my mind off my problems.

86
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,095
I'm signing up.

87
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,168
I think I'm gonna apply.

88
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,171
I bet these mutts
are drug sniffers.

89
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,605
- Undercover dogs?
- You never know, man.

90
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,506
Fuck it. You know what?
I'm in, man.

91
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,568
Me too.

92
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,172
- Ryan?
- Yo.

93
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,342
- Can we get a doggie?
- Not a chance.

94
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,585
Come on in
and sit down.

95
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,057
Hey, girl, yeah.

96
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,021
Yeah.

97
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,794
What did you do to get in here
with us bastards, huh?

98
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,098
Miguel, I've looked
through your file,

99
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,764
and I gotta be
honest with you.

100
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,070
You're not really
suited for this program.

101
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,339
- Why is that?
- You've got a history of violence.

102
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,178
Did you read in there about the C.O.
I blinded, Eugene Rivera?

103
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,949
Yeah, that kinda
jumped out at me.

104
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,547
Well, that's why
you gotta let me do this.

105
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,884
It's what I owe.

106
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,693
Just a good thing to even out
all the bad, you know what I'm saying?

107
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,630
Check this out.
She already picked me.

108
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,639
Yeah, yeah, girl.

109
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,246
Oh, that's
my bitch right there.

110
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,777
Step back a second,
Penders.

111
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,950
You don't get
your bitch just yet.

112
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,860
This isn't the city pound,
so I'll be assigning you your dog,

113
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,524
- which is how you'll refer to them.
- You the bitch.

114
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,659
First let me run down what
we're going to accomplish here.

115
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,693
The goal is to teach them,

116
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,535
and you, basic obedience.

117
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,564
So, we step out of line

118
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,544
and you hit us on the nose
with a rolled-up newspaper?

119
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,773
If I have to.

120
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,679
Now, you'll teach the dogs:

121
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,651
Come, sit, stay...
the basics.

122
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,451
But more importantly,
you'll show them love and trust.

123
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,219
For these dogs to be useful
to the visually impaired,

124
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,251
they have to be comfortable,
not just with their owners,

125
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,594
but with all people.
If we don't accomplish that,

126
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,726
then all you've raised is a pet,
just like any other shmoe.

127
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,396
- Yes?
- These dogs, they stay with us?

128
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,895
- Yes, in your pods.
- How do you keep them safe?

129
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,375
Like I said,
love and trust.

130
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,176
Shit, that's like
conjugals and cigarettes.

131
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,012
- Meaning?
- Those two things don't exist in Oz.

132
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,220
Check it out, the boys
brought their dates home.

133
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,294
So has your little mongrel
learned about pain yet?

134
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,130
Stay the fuck away
from her.

135
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,001
You're afraid I'm gonna hurt
your little poochie-woochie?

136
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,108
No, I'm afraid
she might hurt you, bro'.

137
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,169
Come on, girl.

138
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,839
Come on. Inside.

139
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,578
This is your new home.
This is your daddy's home.

140
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,020
Yeah, come over here.

141
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,891
All Vikings were
not stupid brutes.

142
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,927
They had moments
of brilliance.

143
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,338
They were such great
shipbuilders and sailors

144
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,571
that Leif Eriksson and his crew
landed in America first,

145
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,638
some say traveling
as far south as New York harbor.

146
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,275
Here's where
the true brilliance comes in.

147
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,184
They took a look,
turned around and went home.

148
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,383
You sent 200 letters
to the station

149
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,552
protesting the cancelation
of "Miss Sally's Schoolyard."

150
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,927
I wanted the programmers
to see there's a groundswell of support,

151
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,228
a grassroots demand
for the show to continue.

152
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,166
All from the same address?

153
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,602
I just got this letter
from the station manager today.

154
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,096
"Thank you for writing," blah blah. "Your
exceptional education," blah blah.

155
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,372
Unfortunately, 'Miss Sally's Schoolyard'
has ceased production."

156
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,379
- Ah. I'm gonna miss Miss Sally.
- Wait.

157
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,382
"I'm happy to announce
Whitney Allen will be appearing

158
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,351
in a new exercise series
called 'Sallycise.'

159
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,980
We hope you enjoy it.
Sincerely," blah.

160
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,616
I wonder if my Norma
will have a job on the new show.

161
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,649
You still haven't heard
from her, huh?

162
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,560
No, but I live
in expectation.

163
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,759
- Did you get ahold of your son?
- Yes.

164
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,859
- And?
- And there is no "and."

165
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,132
But did you tell him
you plan to win the lottery?

166
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,572
That you'll use the money
to save Alex Jr. From the leukemia?

167
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,509
- No.
- Isn't that why you phoned him?

168
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,172
Midway I decided I shouldn't
get the family's hopes up.

169
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,272
You're starting to doubt you picked
the winning numbers.

170
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,809
Of course not. My concern
is I don't know whether Officer Brass

171
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,650
actually bought
the ticket for me.

172
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,988
Officer Brass?
Officer Brass?

173
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,560
- Officer Brass?
- What? What is it, Rebadow?

174
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,224
Did you buy
my Mightyball ticket?

175
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,702
What? Yeah, yeah.

176
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,169
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

177
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,806
I thought the warden had you
assigned to the cafeteria.

178
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,215
He does. I'm on a break.
I wanted to see how you guys are doing.

179
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,015
I got PMS.
I'm doing like shit.

180
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,454
Officer Brass,
good to see you.

181
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,481
Yeah, why's that?

182
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,585
Glynn's bringing more and more
nigger C.O. S every day.

183
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,495
In my book, any pale face
is a good pale face.

184
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,829
Let me ask you something.

185
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,732
Were you around
the day I got cut?

186
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,737
No, me and Robson
were on work detail.

187
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,968
If I'd have been here, I would have
pulled that monkey off you.

188
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,841
- So you know which monkey it was?
- Who exactly? No.

189
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,972
I guarantee you this, though,
it wasn't a white man.

190
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,039
- Hey, Brass.
- Yeah?

191
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,048
- You drink?
- Why, you wanna grab a couple of beers?

192
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,791
How about a blood-piss-shit-
puke cocktail, motherfucker?

193
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,363
God, that son of a bitch!

194
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,278
- How you feeling, Dave?
- I'm fine.

195
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,081
- Can I go?
- Sure.

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,987
Just come back in a week or so
and we'll do all your blood work.

197
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,548
It's important
that we check for everything...

198
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,618
hepatitis, TB, HIV...

199
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,323
just to be safe.

200
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,561
Dave.

201
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,672
I always feel
it's not my place to say this,

202
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,868
but when I think of what
can happen if I didn't,

203
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,674
- I know I'd hate myself.
- Say what?

204
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:38,012
Do you have a girlfriend
or sexual partner?

205
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,508
- Kate.
- You should mention what happened.

206
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,318
Just so she knows.

207
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,352
You're right.
It's not your place.

208
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,644
- Hola, Dr. Nathan.
- Hola.

209
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,230
Stop that.

210
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,036
Officer?

211
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,634
- Problem?
- He really should be in the hospital.

212
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,770
- No can do.
- I know he attacked one of your own,

213
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,508
but I can't treat him
properly here.

214
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,142
- I have to check with the warden.
- Then go check.

215
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,879
Hurry.

216
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,547
Gracias.

217
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,129
I said stop it.

218
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,700
I said stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

219
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,112
Stop it! I said stop it!
Don't touch me!

220
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,981
Don't touch me!
What's the matter with you?!

221
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,714
Martinez kept touching me,

222
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,951
I-I had these
flashes back to the rape

223
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,255
then I just lost control.

224
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,353
Or maybe at the moment,

225
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,626
you were actually
in control.

226
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,998
Peter Marie,
I beat an injured man.

227
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,003
Yes, I know,
but by beating him,

228
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,234
you were finally
in charge of the situation.

229
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,208
Look, you've told me
on any number of occasions

230
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,234
that since the rape
you feel adrift.

231
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,246
Well, maybe
this incident today

232
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,249
was an attempt to regain
control of your life.

233
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,808
All I keep having
are incidents like these.

234
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,582
Are you saying I antagonize
these men on purpose?

235
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,487
No, no, no,
but I do think

236
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,119
you have to answer a question I asked
when you first returned to work.

237
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,322
Why?

238
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,423
Why after being
beaten and violated

239
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,334
did you choose to return
to a place filled with brutal men?

240
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:16,030
I still don't know.

241
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,043
Well, I think
if we work on it,

242
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,136
and if we figure it out,

243
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,977
you'll finally
start to heal.

244
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,144
According to Norse
mythology,

245
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,623
man was made from an ash tree
and woman from an adder.

246
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,820
The great god Odin
gave them both life and souls

247
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,260
and a place
to live called Midgard,

248
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,754
which Odin created from the eyebrows
of a giant he slew.

249
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,791
Sounds almost true,
don't it?

250
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,000
All of us living
on the edge of an eyebrow.

251
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,838
Homosexuality...

252
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,242
is a perversion
against God's will.

253
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,544
I agree.

254
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,609
And yet you practice
sodomy yourself.

255
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,213
- I'm no faggot.
- You raped Beecher,

256
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,384
and Cyril O'Reily
and God knows how many others.

257
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,257
I never touched anybody.

258
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,956
You lying
cock-sucking fuck!

259
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,931
- Tobias.
- How can you deny what you did?

260
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,662
- Tobias! Officer!
- Get your fucking hands off me!

261
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,602
- Stop it!
- Come on! Fuck you!

262
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,300
You fucking lying bitch!
You lying fucking sack of shit!

263
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,483
Hey there, Petey.

264
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,461
Getting some shrink time?
That's good.

265
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,658
After a trauma
like you went through,

266
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,189
getting gang-raped and all...

267
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,996
No!

268
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,769
...it's healthy
to talk about the experience.

269
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,609
You probably shouldn't get
too specific in the details, though.

270
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,444
That might not be
so healthy after all.

271
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,576
Leave me alone.

272
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,519
Sure. For now.

273
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,216
Keep your sunny side up.

274
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,722
Hello, Chris.

275
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,896
How are you?

276
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,231
Well, I tell you,
being alone

277
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,002
gives you an awful lot
of time to think.

278
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,374
I'm sitting here
thinking about irony,

279
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,709
the irony of my life.

280
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,739
I'm sorry I can't convince the warden
to let you see Beecher.

281
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,048
He's not even allowing
an exchange of letters.

282
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,681
Let me tell you, it was easier
being apart when I was in Massachusetts.

283
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,520
Knowing he's
in this building...

284
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,259
knowing that maybe
he's behind that wall.

285
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,165
You said you were
gonna talk to a lawyer,

286
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,933
that you'd get
a defense lawyer for me.

287
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,000
The only way I'm seeing Beecher
is if I beat this murder rap.

288
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,136
I'll know
something shortly.

289
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,670
Meanwhile, keep the faith.

290
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,706
Keep it where?

291
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,019
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,089
What a nice surprise.

293
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,136
My cell phone never seems to work
in here, so I asked Sister Peter Marie

294
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,197
- if I could use her phone.
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,970
I was talking to Freddy Rudolph
about his hearing

296
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,070
and then Sister asked
if I could speak with another prisoner.

297
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,344
Chris Keller.

298
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,579
What?

299
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,183
- Don't.
- Why?

300
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,125
- Just don't.
- I've heard legends about Keller.

301
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,094
I'm curious.

302
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,689
Catherine...

303
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,303
- I love you.
- And you love Keller, right?

304
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,899
I mean, you still
love Keller, don't you?

305
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,206
Lf-if you meet him...

306
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,440
He's very seductive.
He...

307
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,180
You're gonna fall
in love with him too.

308
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,911
I'm willing
to take that chance.

309
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,891
Besides, I can't pass up
the opportunity

310
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,722
to meet my boyfriend's
boyfriend.

311
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,762
Here you go, Keller.

312
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,891
Bag of Atomic Fireballs
per your request.

313
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,867
Thanks, Claire.

314
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,530
You know I was needing
a little something to suck on.

315
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,371
Warden finds out I smuggled them
in for you, he'll have my ass.

316
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,969
Hmm, what a great ass it is.

317
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,938
- You're bad.
- So spank me.

318
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,555
You got a visitor, Keller.

319
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,354
Hello.

320
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,163
I'm Catherine McClain
from the Alliance for Prisoner Rights.

321
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,930
Sister Peter Marie
asked me to stop by.

322
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,135
- Can we be alone?
- We'll be right outside.

323
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,873
Did you kill
those three men?

324
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:25,007
You get right
to the point, don't you?

325
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,642
I don't have
a lot of time.

326
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,744
I got nothing but time.

327
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,414
Maybe not.

328
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,355
You're facing
the death penalty.

329
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,991
I'm not afraid to die.

330
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,724
I just wanna die
for the right reason.

331
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,668
- And the right reason would be...
- Love.

332
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,864
We have a mutual friend.

333
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,240
- Yeah, who?
- Tobias Beecher.

334
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,877
Oh, wait...

335
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,577
I know who you are.

336
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,644
You're the one that tried
to help Toby with his parole.

337
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,714
- Yes.
- And he wrote me about you.

338
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,250
Yeah, what did he say?

339
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,400
- He loves you.
- You'll understand my dilemma now.

340
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,473
You see, if you fry,
you're a memory.

341
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,709
If I get you off,
you and Toby will be reunited.

342
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,443
So now I know you'll do everything
in your power to get me off.

343
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,510
- And why's that?
- If you love Toby as much as I do,

344
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,182
then you want him
to be happy.

345
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,624
Reuniting us
will make him happy.

346
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,959
Yeah.

347
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,022
Counselor.

348
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,635
- Did you kill those three men?
- No.

349
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,072
- Fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up!

350
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,550
You fucking cunt!
You fucking cunt!

351
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,924
Prisoner #02G561

352
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,630
and #02W562:

353
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,900
Adam Guenzel
and Franklin Winthrop:

354
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,635
Convicted January 14, 2002:

355
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,973
Rape, attempted murder
in the first degree:

356
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,275
Sentence: 28 years:

357
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,975
Up for parole in seven.

358
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,643
Okay, let's go.

359
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,977
Come on.

360
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,243
Come on over here, boy!

361
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,986
That one's yours.

362
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,758
This'll be the first time
I ever had to make my own bed.

363
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,197
Adam, take my word,

364
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:32,693
nothing you experienced growing up
in Broun Park has prepared you for Oz.

365
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,673
I know it's hard,

366
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,699
but I'll be here
for you, I promise.

367
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,906
Your dad was my scoutmaster,
for God's sake.

368
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,279
You have to
understand something.

369
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,945
That girl Franklin
and I raped...

370
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,945
we were drunk,
all three of us partying.

371
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,056
I blacked out.

372
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,823
I'd never meant
to hurt her.

373
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,093
Yeah, but you did.

374
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,622
That's why you're standing
where you're standing.

375
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,795
Don't forget that, ever.

376
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,998
The guilt may
keep you sane.

377
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,472
Yeah.

378
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,100
Get settled,

379
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,303
and I'll introduce
you around.

380
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,725
Yo, you need a helping hand
there, pretty boy?

381
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,527
You ever suck cock before?

382
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,932
Back off, Clarence.

383
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,233
All right, Vern.
No need to get testy.

384
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,868
You okay?

385
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,313
He was gonna rape me.

386
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,580
Fucking nigger.

387
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,645
We'll protect you from now on.
You'll be safe.

388
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,486
Jesus, thanks.

389
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,687
But, like everything else
in life...

390
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,456
it's gonna cost.

391
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,466
You've got
an alcohol problem,

392
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,532
so you should join
Sister Pete's therapy.

393
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,942
Ooh, he's hot!

394
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,913
- Fucking Christ.
- What?

395
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,042
Remember that friend Franklin Winthrop
I was telling you about?

396
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,779
- Yeah.
- That's him.

397
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,654
Franklin.

398
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,219
Your boy is next.

399
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,366
Fuck!

400
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,233
I need your help. I need you
to protect Adam from the Aryans.

401
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,313
I can't.

402
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,372
What do you mean,
you can't?

403
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,940
Beecher...

404
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:04,115
when I stabbed Schillinger
and Robson defending you,

405
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,147
I put a lot of my Muslim
brothers in jeopardy.

406
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,985
So I can't
do that again.

407
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,725
Certainly not
over some boy

408
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,460
who rapes and beats women.

409
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,935
I know.

410
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,937
Adam's no angel,

411
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,405
but I've known him
since he was a child.

412
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,705
I know his family. I-I can't justify
what he did, but...

413
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,541
Beecher, stop.

414
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,774
My answer is no.

415
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,887
- Well?
- It's not gonna work.

416
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,590
Shit!

417
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,791
Okay here's what
we're gonna do.

418
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,394
As a temporary stopgap,
you're gonna go to McManus

419
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,133
- and request protective custody.
- Until when?

420
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,300
Until I can figure
something else out.

421
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,670
Fuck.

422
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,861
He's mine.

423
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,615
Clean him up.

424
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,086
Prisoner #02U672:

425
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,283
Francis Urbano,
a.k.a. Frank the Fixer:

426
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,520
Convicted January 7th, 2002:

427
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,084
Murder in the first degree:

428
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,722
Sentence: Life:

429
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,699
Up for parole
in 25 years.

430
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,604
Sister Peter Marie wanted me
to drop this off for Dr. Nathan.

431
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,093
Pancamo,
you look like shit.

432
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,892
I got a fever
or something.

433
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,761
Can you hand me
some water?

434
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,528
Yeah, sure.

435
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,669
You know, l... I know you hate
the Aryans as much as I do, right?

436
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,334
More.

437
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,843
Those Nazi fucks shanked me

438
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,971
and raped Peter Schibetta.

439
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,709
Well, I got a friend who
they've threatened to rape, too.

440
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,343
I was wondering if you could
do something to protect him.

441
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,548
- Beecher, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

442
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,352
- Do it somewhere else.
- Yes, sir.

443
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,983
- What do you say?
- Done.

444
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,618
Thank you.

445
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,541
Oh, I like
a man who sweats.

446
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,636
- Leave him alone.
- Stay out of this, prag.

447
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,840
So there's two ways
this could go, precious:

448
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,042
Kick or kiss.

449
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,575
They both end up the same:
With my dick up your ass.

450
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,315
Not necessarily.

451
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,882
Oh, who the fuck
are you?

452
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,985
Who the fuck am I?

453
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,041
- Hey, you piece of shit.
- Fuck you!

454
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,381
How's the wound,
you fucking guinea? Huh?

455
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,151
Lockdown!

456
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,940
- Man, I was so fucking terrified.
- I know.

457
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,247
I mean, there were arms and legs
and knives everywhere!

458
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,775
Yeah, well,
it's over now.

459
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,311
Damn! Jesus, I didn't know
which way to turn!

460
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,654
I mean,
I was so pumped!

461
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,592
Part of me wanted to jump right in
and kick some ass.

462
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,425
- Adam.
- I could've, you know.

463
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,363
I could've kicked
some royal ass.

464
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,733
Fuck!

465
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,540
The Vikings had a code of behavior
which they followed religiously:

466
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,305
Honor and valor
on the battlefield

467
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,006
were the values that
a warrior strived for.

468
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,380
But much like the men in Oz,
they had no concept of good and evil.

469
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,408
They couldn't
tell the difference.

470
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,352
They didn't know
there should be one.

471
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,888
Hey, Gloria. I heard
what happened. Are you okay?

472
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,988
- I'm fine.
- That's good.

473
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,726
Come in.

474
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,264
I met your mother.

475
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,863
Yeah, I know.
She told me.

476
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,739
She seems nice.

477
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,210
She's so
completely different

478
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,112
than the woman I grew up
thinking was my real mom,

479
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,276
my other mom,
Cyril's mom, Tessie...

480
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,479
That was
her first name, Tessie.

481
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,988
Growing up,
Tessie was always sobbing.

482
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,991
She had good reason.
You know, Cyril and I,

483
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,357
we never gave her
any cause to smile.

484
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,424
- It's crazy, though.
- What?

485
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,399
Now that my mom is here,

486
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,425
you know, doing this
community service,

487
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,269
well, she and me
and Cyril,

488
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,504
it's like we're a family,
you know? It's fucking great.

489
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,238
Ryan, have you
told her anything

490
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:09,845
about what went on
between you and me,

491
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,414
Cyril, my husband Keenan?

492
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,621
No, huh-uh. Huh-uh.
I mean, she's been asking but...

493
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,492
- Don't you think you should?
- Why?

494
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,827
What good would
it do her knowing that shit?

495
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,925
You can't just present
the good son side of yourself to her.

496
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,731
Look, Gloria,
I'm in Oz.

497
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,500
I don't think my mom thinks
I'm up for any sainthood.

498
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,406
If you want to have
a real relationship with her,

499
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,672
you have to tell her
the whole truth.

500
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,611
Huh-uh, I can't tell her
the whole truth.

501
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,581
- Why not?
- Because then she'll stop loving me.

502
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,213
I don't think so.

503
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,818
In my experience,

504
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,591
you don't love
Ryan O'Reily by choice.

505
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:08,308
? Old McDonald
had a farm?

506
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,372
? E-l-E-l-O...?

507
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,179
Relax, relax.

508
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,551
? And on that farm,
he had some cars...?

509
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:21,024
- Cars?
- ? E-l-E-l-O...?

510
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,495
- With a...
- ? With a vroom-vroom here.?

511
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,190
Not bad, kid.

512
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,323
Don't laugh.
At least I'm trying.

513
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,357
Yeah, he's right.

514
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,096
I don't see you
making any effort.

515
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,831
I got a little
something-something

516
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,169
- I might bust out at the variety show.
- Really?

517
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,368
What's that?

518
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,001
You'll see.

519
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,103
Hey, Ma, I wanna
ask you something.

520
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,240
Do you think families need to be
100% honest with each other?

521
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,981
Yeah.

522
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,286
What... I mean, if your father
and I had been honest,

523
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,658
if we'd been open and we'd
worked through our problems

524
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,825
and all our fears,
maybe I wouldn't have left.

525
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,358
I think about how different my life
would've gone if you'd stayed married.

526
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,394
Yeah, well,
don't romanticize it.

527
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,872
It still would've
been really difficult.

528
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,569
I know that,
but we would've been,

529
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,669
you know, together.

530
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,839
Yeah.

531
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,247
After we're done
fucking around here,

532
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,643
I want to tell you about
some of the things

533
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,087
that I've done, you know,

534
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,354
since I've been in Oz.

535
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,724
And I just...

536
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,423
I want to warn you, Mom,
it's not pretty.

537
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,058
Well, I wouldn't
expect it to be.

538
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,399
But that's good, because maybe
if you tell me about it,

539
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,371
it'll start to make
some sense to you.

540
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,669
Yeah.

541
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:48,167
So... what do you got?

542
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,181
- It's little something-something.
- Let's see it.

543
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,740
? This is a low card,
what you call a jack move?

544
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,184
? I'm takin' your flow card
to replicate rat's move?

545
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,780
? I'm callin' your bluff,
I've seen enough, what, what?

546
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,348
? Don't you say nothin' until I finish,
your mouth shut?

547
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,860
? Now answer them, yeah, yeah,
your heart is excited?

548
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,522
? So what's
all the fightin'??

549
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,895
- That's great!
- ? If I show you what I did?

550
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,628
? I'm not gonna ever lose,
I'm steppin', so what up, kid??

551
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,397
? You wanna play hard...?

552
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,704
- Today's the day.
- Yeah.

553
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,405
Kill them both,

554
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,380
but if you can
only get one, get Ryan.

555
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,282
We can always whack the 'tard
once the older brother's dead.

556
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,582
Shupe.

557
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,994
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Not now, Shupe.

558
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,657
- It's important.
- Okay, you got 10 seconds. What is it?

559
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,657
I overheard Li talking to Jia.
They were arguing about your mom.

560
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,535
- What?
- Li was saying he's gonna rape her.

561
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,665
Fuck.

562
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,198
- You got any tits, man?
- Yeah.

563
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,344
Ryan, is that man
gonna hurt Ma?

564
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,245
No fucking chance, Cyril.

565
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,445
Whoa, so your boys are
gonna hurt my mom, huh?

566
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,918
He's out of control,
O'Reily.

567
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,945
- I don't know what to do.
- Yeah, well, I do.

568
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,353
Hey.

569
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,946
I'm telling you,
he was gonna rape my mother.

570
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,888
- Do you have proof of that?
- Ask Jia.

571
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,652
- He knows all about it.
- I will.

572
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,455
- Meanwhile, I want Cyril in solitary.
- No!

573
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,395
Li's just the latest in a long line
of people Cyril's hurt.

574
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,092
I want him somewhere
he's not gonna hurt anybody else.

575
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,227
- Hey, he's all yours.
- Ryan?

576
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,465
It's gonna be okay,
Cyril. It's gonna be okay.

577
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,632
- Be gentle with him, man.
- I don't wanna go!

578
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,505
- Come on, let's go!
- I'm sorry.

579
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,772
- You cocksucker!
- Save your anger, O'Reily.

580
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,642
This time we're
gonna go the distance.

581
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,547
Cyril either ends up
in the insane asylum or death row.

582
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,380
And you're going
to the cage, come on.

583
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,283
Come on. Come on, O'Reily.
Let's go.

584
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,948
Sister, you've
gotta believe me!

585
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:16,016
You know, it's just possible
he's telling the truth.

586
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,358
O'Reily? The truth?
I doubt it.

587
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,862
Please! Please!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

588
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,131
Please, I don't want
to go in there.

589
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,638
No! No!

590
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,164
Please, I'm so so sorry!

591
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,540
Please! No!

592
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,247
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

593
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,481
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

594
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,391
Hey, Jia, Jia, Jia,
Come here. Hey, come here.

595
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,694
You gotta go to McManus and tell him
that Li was gonna rape my ma, okay?

596
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,360
- I got nothing to say to that.
- Whoa, Jia, come on!

597
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,834
You gotta
do that for me, man!

598
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,427
You gotta tell him.

599
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,768
Your brother's
gonna die.

600
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,138
They're gonna fry
his white ass,

601
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,938
and I'll be
sitting in the front row

602
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,945
laughing my balls off,
you fucking mick.

603
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,142
What? You fucking
chink motherfucker!

604
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,845
Are you fucking kidding me?
You're fucking dead, Jia!

605
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,877
You're fucking dead,
you rice-eating little fucking bitch!

606
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,824
You're fucking dead! You're dead,
you fucking shit motherfucker!

607
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,202
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, Warden.

608
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,932
Nice place you got here.

609
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,271
What do you want, Redding?

610
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,710
Control of the cafeteria.

611
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,509
The Sicilians
run the cafeteria.

612
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,243
Yeah, but Chucky Pancamo's
still in the hospital.

613
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,773
Pete Schibetta, psycho ward.

614
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,979
The place is
out of control.

615
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,853
Hmm, you think you can pull
the operation back together?

616
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,790
Most of those guys
are friends of mine.

617
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,385
Most of them are black
and they don't take too kindly

618
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,419
to kowtowing
to the dagos.

619
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,591
I let Adebisi call
the shots in the cafeteria.

620
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:06,433
- It was a disaster.
- I ain't Adebisi, am I?

621
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,042
Truth is, there have
been a lot of fuck-ups

622
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,410
all the way back
to the gas explosion.

623
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:20,406
All right, Redding,
I'll give you a chance.

624
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,942
- Officer.
- One other thing,

625
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,013
I'd appreciate it if you got them
Sicilians out of there.

626
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,081
Sure.

627
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,685
Much obliged.

628
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:39,494
Augustus, Augustus...

629
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,569
Augustus,
where's your dog?

630
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,705
She's in my pod. I don't feel
like playing with her right now.

631
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,183
- Thinking about your mother?
- Yeah.

632
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,016
It'll take more than a few weeks
for me to get over her death.

633
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,715
That's not
what I meant.

634
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,281
I just keep picturing her
trying to figure out

635
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,793
which way is up
as the fucking bus rolls.

636
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,888
She hated closed spaces,
being trapped.

637
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,990
Freaked her out.

638
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,025
Now she's trapped forever
in some cheap-ass coffin.

639
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,402
- You gotta move beyond that.
- Fuck you, Beecher.

640
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,873
I know what you're feeling.
I buried my son.

641
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,739
You know,
this may sound strange,

642
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,608
but you gotta
work those images.

643
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,705
Your mind's already taken
your mother from the bus to the grave.

644
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:28,240
Now keep going. You gotta picture
her body under the ground rotting away.

645
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,311
- Get the fuck out of my...
- Listen to me.

646
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,515
You have to imagine
your mother decaying,

647
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,652
the maggots eating away her flesh,
leaving nothing but the bone.

648
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,663
You gotta hear
that coffin splinter,

649
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,722
smell the dirt falling
through the cracks.

650
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,733
And why the fuck would I
want to do that?

651
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,667
To let your mother go.

652
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,967
Right now she's
defined by her death.

653
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,473
This is the only way to lose
the horror of what happened

654
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,567
and to move on to everything
good about her.

655
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,341
I can't, you fuck! All I can see
is the fucking bus!

656
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,439
- Just take a walk, Beecher!
- Augustus.

657
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,383
Take a fucking walk!

658
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,613
Jesus!

659
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,761
Give me
that shit, man. Yeah.

660
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,795
Yeah, let him in.

661
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:24,732
Give me something.

662
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,812
- Some of this?
- Yeah.

663
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,713
Why? Why the change
of vein?

664
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,444
I need
a consolation prize.

665
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,021
Yeah, welcome back.

666
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,520
Yo, dude,

667
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,296
this motherfucker ain't
done tits in like years.

668
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,927
Oh, yeah.

669
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,500
Yeah, there you go.
Go get it. Yeah.

670
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,534
? Swing low?

671
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,912
? Sweet chariot?

672
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:09,249
? Coming for
to carry me home...?

673
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,251
? Swing low?

674
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:18,785
? Sweet chariot?

675
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,457
? Coming for?

676
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:26,458
? To carry me home...?

677
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,940
- Now you expect me to sing like that?
- No, no, Omar.

678
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:43,442
I just... I want you to enjoy it
as much as I do.

679
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,945
I never thought
I'd say this, but I do.

680
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,119
- I think I really do.
- Good, good.

681
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,493
I mean, you know, the last couple
of lessons, they were slammin'!

682
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,225
I mean, they...
they rocked!

683
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,631
Oh.

684
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,465
Well, it looks
like time's up.

685
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,406
- I'll catch you later, teacher.
- Okay.

686
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,739
Practice.

687
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,182
How's it hangin', boss?

688
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,853
? Swing low?

689
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,413
? Sweet Harriet?

690
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:24,325
? Bustin' my nut
to the bone?

691
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,420
? Swing low?

692
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,523
? Swing low,
sweet chariot...?

693
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,295
Omar, Omar, Omar,

694
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,996
your lesson's over.

695
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,698
Hey, I got a song
in my heart.

696
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,763
You ain't gonna begrudge me
of that, is you?

697
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:40,299
All I'm asking you, Omar,
is to keep the song in your heart.

698
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,610
- ? From sea...?
- Yo, White, you take requests?

699
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,084
Sure, motherfucker,
what you want to hear?

700
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,212
Shut the fuck up.

701
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,284
I will not fight.

702
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,158
I will not fight.

703
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,255
See if you can sing now,
motherfucker.

704
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,997
- Leave him alone, Guerra.
- Or what?

705
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,004
Break up the square dance.
Come on, as of right fuckin' now.

706
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,438
Tell Mr. Bojangles
to keep his fuckin' trap shut.

707
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,669
Get the fuck
out of here now! Move it!

708
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,970
That's pretty good
looking out, man.

709
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,743
Stay out of trouble,
Omar.

710
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,943
Yo, wait, let me tell you
something, though.

711
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,511
For the first time, me and trouble
ain't even on speaking terms.

712
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,955
- What was up with Guerra?
- He stepped to me.

713
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,652
- You saw that.
- Stop the finger-pointing.

714
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,161
All blame lies with you...

715
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,331
and therefore on me,
and I am not gonna have it.

716
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:40,496
Said, I gotta practice.

717
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:44,200
Practice... practice is gonna
make me perfect.

718
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,209
Then when trouble comes,
run away.

719
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,711
That ain't gonna help
my reputation up here at Oz.

720
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,807
The only person your
reputation matters with is me.

721
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,978
The moment you forget that
you go straight back to solitary.

722
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,978
Now you understand me?
Do you understand me?

723
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,358
? Swing low?

724
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,422
? Sweet chariot?

725
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,333
? Comin' for
to carry me home.?

726
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,238
- What's up?
- Omar White.

727
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,204
He's following instructions
without too much whining.

728
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,146
I have managed
to keep him clean.

729
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,379
The singing... seems
to have focused him.

730
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,545
- It's just...
- He's driving you crazy?

731
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:35,081
No, the problem is he's catching
a lot of flack from the other inmates.

732
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,424
They're harassing him,
and he may get hurt, McManus.

733
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,293
There's only
so much that I can do.

734
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,026
He doesn't have anywhere else
to practice except in my pod.

735
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,660
- Which is when he drives you crazy?
- Yes.

736
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,761
I don't know if there
are any other options.

737
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,830
I will support him
as much as I can,

738
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,309
- but I need to pray in silence.
- Okay, okay.

739
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,743
Let me do some math, okay?

740
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,979
Thank you.

741
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,479
? Comin' for to carry me...?

742
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,081
? Comin' for... comin' for
to carry me home?

743
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,826
- ? Swing low...?
- Omar.

744
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,692
Let's take a walk.

745
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:16,358
- Did I fuck up?
- No, nothing like that.

746
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,267
So, I hear you're
singing up a storm.

747
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,362
Yeah, no, I mean,
who'd have thunk it, right?

748
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,566
I'm the motherfuckin'
Omar "Barry" White.

749
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,201
- Yo, you wanna hear a few bars?
- Not right now.

750
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,838
As a matter of fact, Omar,
neither does anybody else.

751
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,007
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
hold it, hold it.

752
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,450
First you encourage me
to do this shit, right?

753
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,715
- Now you want me to stop?
- Follow me.

754
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,088
Where you going, man?

755
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,154
You ain't sticking me
in Gen Pop and shit.

756
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,722
Calm down,
we're almost there.

757
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,326
What the fuck is this, man?
Shit. Hey, yo, McManus,

758
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,599
I ain't with this shit
at all, all right?

759
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,905
Oh, no, man, you ain't going
to make me mop and shit again?

760
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:03,640
Omar, Omar, if you would just
shut up a fuckin' second,

761
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,614
I think that
you'll be pleased.

762
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,090
Oh shit.

763
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:17,184
Damn, boy.

764
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:21,163
You'll practice
in here for an hour each day.

765
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:26,593
Damn, you all right,
McManus.

766
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,765
You a straight up
motherfuckin' humdinger, boy.

767
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,333
Yeah, yeah,
that's me, humdinger.

768
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,652
I heard you got your own
little private practice shack.

769
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,588
You ready to do
a little slinging for me?

770
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,751
Slinging? Sling what?
What you mean, like selling drugs?

771
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,353
No, no, I can't...
I can't...

772
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,762
I can't risk that now.

773
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,959
Now, see...

774
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,299
that's not the answer
I was looking to hear from you.

775
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,638
Now here's how
it's gonna work.

776
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,976
I'm going to give you
the stash,

777
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,979
you move it on over
to my man Reggie,

778
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,174
and he moves it
on over to Unit C.

779
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,279
And if you got
a problem with that,

780
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,619
then you gonna have
a bigger problem with me.

781
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,420
So I'm going to ask you
one more time,

782
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,428
are you ready to do
some slinging with me?

783
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,992
Fuck it, fuck it.
Fine, fine.

784
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,868
Take it.

785
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,407
Omar,

786
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,140
if I find out you been
using some of that shit,

787
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,911
there ain't going to be nothing left
of you to sweep up off the floor.

788
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,350
Believe me, Redding,

789
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:52,321
this time I actually
want to stay clean.

790
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,722
Yeah, well,

791
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,885
miracles do happen.

792
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,132
? Swing low?

793
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,101
? Sweet chariot?

794
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,900
? Comin' for to carry me...?

795
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,768
? Home...?

796
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,878
? Comin' for
to carry me home.?

797
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,512
- You Reggie?
- Who else you think gonna be knockin'?

798
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:27,182
- Destiny's child?
- That was rhetorical shit, all right?

799
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,660
If rhetorical means dumb as fuck,
you got that right.

800
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,322
You ain't too big on the small talk,
is you, brother?

801
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:37,129
- Business is business.
- Yeah, well...

802
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,067
pleasure's better.

803
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,498
Later, fuckin'
rhetorical nigger.

804
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,639
Yo, Red.

805
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,511
Good work.

806
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,824
Never let it be said that I ain't
a patron of the arts.

807
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,504
Whoo, boy!

808
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,305
Tough day
at the office, Jack.

809
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,334
How was yours?

810
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,111
What... what you doing?

811
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:32,054
Omar. Please.

812
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,591
What?

813
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,560
Be quiet.

814
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,994
Yeah, I'm just trying
to wind down and shit,

815
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:46,264
- you know what I'm saying?
- Then wind down in silence.

816
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,836
What the fuck?
What's eating you?

817
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,670
Something I did
or something? What?

818
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,643
Omar, now you may be
my biggest concern,

819
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,612
but you are
certainly not my only one.

820
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,944
So please, please, please!

821
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,016
Leave me in peace.

822
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,045
All right.

823
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,543
Good morning, lmam.

824
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,117
Preparing for
tomorrow's lecture?

825
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,948
No.

826
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,788
Music appreciation
and theory?

827
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,595
That's right.

828
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,690
What about us, Minister?

829
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,600
I understand our faith
does not discourage

830
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,797
against the improvement
of others,

831
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,534
but it also mandates
that our leader lead.

832
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:03,539
We're concerned that Omar White
is becoming too much of a distraction.

833
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,980
We?

834
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,348
Lalar, you concur?

835
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,183
- Look...
- Ahmad, do you feel spiritually adrift

836
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:14,384
now that I've taken somebody
else under my wing?

837
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,688
- Imam, l...
- Oh...

838
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,421
Lookie here.

839
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:21,157
Huey, Dewey and Jigabooey
are having a little lesson.

840
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,896
Lalar, step back!

841
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,565
Now.

842
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:36,368
Arif, let's go.

843
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,346
I hope it was
something I said.

844
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,061
Out on the Serengeti,
where these nigs are from,

845
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:56,259
you know how you send
a message to the leader of the pack?

846
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,927
You kill the youngest
and the weakest of the herd.

847
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,733
I seen that
on those wildlife shows.

848
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:06,140
Well, I think it's time
we do a little big game hunting.

849
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,606
The Vikings eventually
got civilized, became Christians.

850
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:16,244
They're now the Danes,
the Norwegians, the Swedes.

851
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,655
What's ironic is despite all them
war-loving genes in their system,

852
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,318
Norway now gives
out the Nobel Peace Prize.

853
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,328
I guess
a people can change

854
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,557
if they put
their collective minds to it.

855
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,741
Pretty cushy gig
for a jig,

856
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,543
trusting you around
all of this merchandise.

857
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,050
How are we to know that
you're not stealing shit?

858
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,653
I guess we better
open you up and check.

859
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,286
Nope, nothing there.

860
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,125
Maybe in his arm.

861
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,665
Maybe.

862
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,173
Oh, strike fuckin' two.

863
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,437
Well, Lalar,

864
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,637
I recommend you
get comfortable.

865
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,239
This could take
a little while.
