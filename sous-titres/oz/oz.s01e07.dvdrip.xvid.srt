1
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:41,063
''The best laid schemes of mice
and men most often go astray.''

2
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:45,485
That was written by Mr. Robert Burns
way the fuck back in 1 785

3
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,108
and it still is news.

4
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,789
ln Oz, we got all sorts of schemes
to change our lousy, lonely lives.

5
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,781
But no matter how much
we plot and plan,

6
00:01:55,961 --> 00:02:01,417
something outside our control always
comes along and fucks things up.

7
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:04,842
You take Tobias Beecher.

8
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:07,758
Six months ago, if you'd asked him
where he planned to be today,

9
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,261
he'd have said at his daughter's
4th birthday party.

10
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:14,805
lnstead, he's howling at the moon
thanks to some bad angel dust.

11
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:18,894
Old Vern Schillinger.
Before he got to Oz,

12
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,273
he wanted to get America
back on the right track.

13
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:22,945
The white track.

14
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:26,530
Now Beecher smashed a piece
of glass in his pure Aryan eye.

15
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:30,988
Timmy McManus.

16
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:35,498
He's slowly watching as his dreams
for the perfect prison fart away.

17
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,909
And then there's
the Reverend Kareem Said.

18
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,335
He was working on a way
to bring the brothers together,

19
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:44,881
to fight the injustices we endure
in the name of justice.

20
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:49,007
He was working it and working it,
till a heart attack worked him over.

21
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,678
Huseni Mershah,
this is Kareem Said.

22
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:56,722
Maybe Allah sent me to remind you.

23
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:02,601
Sit down.

24
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,647
- Help me.
- You must go ahead and die.

25
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,823
Black Muslim leader Kareem Said

26
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,751
remains in critical condition
at Oswald State Penitentiary

27
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,745
after a heart attack last Thursday.

28
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:25,042
Said, who is serving five to 1 8 years
for burning a White-owned warehouse,

29
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,589
is an outspoken critic
of the American judicial system.

30
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,715
Oh, man, it's almost as if he knew.

31
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,805
Man, like, right before the heart attack,

32
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:37,936
Said said to me, he said, ''Huseni,

33
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:43,396
if anything should happen, l want you
to gather up the true believers.

34
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,148
Carry out my work,
carry out my mission.

35
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:52,650
Start a holy war right here in Oz.
A war that will set fire on the sky.''

36
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:56,986
He said, ''Tell them, my brother,
and guide them.''

37
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,364
Man.

38
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:06,632
Hey, hey, hey. Look who's alive.

39
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:12,132
You know, Said, l gotta tell you, odds
were 60-40 you were worm's meat.

40
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:15,390
Yo, Groves, go get Dr. Nathan.
Tell her Said finally woke up.

41
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,969
You're gonna pull something out.

42
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:20,477
- Said, you shouldn't be doing that.
- Stupid nigger.

43
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:25,311
Groves. Groves. Get a doctor.

44
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,315
You,

45
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:34,532
get my clothes.

46
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:36,947
Now.

47
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,741
l'm telling you, l'm perfectly well.

48
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,168
You had a heart attack.
You nearly died.

49
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,374
But l didn't, did l?

50
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,549
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, this time you were lucky.

51
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,210
- What if it happens again?
- Well, believe me, doctor,

52
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,885
l now know what l must do
to keep alive.

53
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,222
McManus, l'm ready to go back
to Em City.

54
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:02,267
Okay, but you have to start taking
the medicine Dr. Nathan prescribed.

55
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,105
Agreed?

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,191
Agreed.

57
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,322
l know. This way.

58
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:21,113
People do terrible things to people.

59
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,037
That's why we got so many prisons
in the world.

60
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:26,204
People rape other people.

61
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,790
They rob and beat
and cheat other people.

62
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,507
But the worst crime of all
is betrayal.

63
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,598
And there ain't no jail terms for that.

64
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,980
Huseni Mershah.

65
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:53,860
You saw that l was dying
and yet you walked away?

66
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,320
You wanted me to die.

67
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,527
No, Kareem, come on, bro.
l would never want--

68
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:02,286
No. This man is not
our brother. He is our enemy.

69
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:04,782
As of this moment,
this man is cast out.

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,914
No Muslim will speak to him, look him
in the eye or acknowledge him.

71
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,288
You wanted the death of another?

72
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,498
Right now, you're dead to us all.

73
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:19,672
Kidnap the president's wife
Without a plan

74
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,014
Kidnap the president's wife
Without a plan

75
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,638
Yeah, l got a plan

76
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:26,095
lt's etched with a knife
ln the centre of my hand

77
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,473
So l guess l'm gonna have to
Keep my fist clenched

78
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,188
Walk around D. C. in the rain
Till my wares is drenched

79
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,401
Wait for that motherfucker
To take out the garbage

80
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:36,573
Do a press conference about
What great shape this country in

81
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,859
And when them welfare cuts
Gonna begin

82
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:41,615
And when he pat his dog
And kiss his wife goodbye,

83
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:44,457
That's when l move in
l throw that silly ho in a headlock

84
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,498
l muffle her grill so her screams stop

85
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:49,420
l whisper to her, ''Your man
Ain't here to protect you, baby''

86
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:50,792
He gone

87
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:54,214
l dial up my nigger, tell him, ''Meet me
With the caddy on the white lawn''

88
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:55,878
l toss her in the back seat

89
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,630
l cover her head with a black sheet

90
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:00,474
Put the still to her grill piece
Be like, ''lf you don't shut up,

91
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,716
l'm gonna lit two shots off
ln your dome piece''

92
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:04,132
Watch her have fits

93
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:07,519
lf she don't understand, l'm gonna
Give her a quick lesson in Ebonics

94
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,854
''l'm gonna shoot you, baby''

95
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:13,524
l take her to my hideout in the
Low-income houses down the street

96
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:16,862
l replace her Joan and Davids
With purple Reeboks on her feet

97
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:20,152
l give her four hungry kids,
No job, no ambition

98
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:23,078
No family support
And a last welfare check

99
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:25,998
l give her crappy-ass Medicaid
And an ill type of growth

100
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,494
Growing out the side of her neck

101
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:31,416
l tell her, ''Fend for yourself, keep you
And them shorties in proper health''

102
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,126
Then after sufficient time on that hype,
l'll introduce her to the crack pipe

103
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:38,715
Yeah, l'll let her
Feel its soothing effects

104
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:41,425
As she tries to forget about
The absence of them checks

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,928
l'll make her sells her jewels for it
l'll make her--

106
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,595
l'll make her pay her dues for it

107
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:48,266
And then l'll come to her late at night

108
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,931
And l'll be like, ''Yo, everything
Ain't gonna be all right

109
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,855
You ain't gonna be able
To go quietly into that good night

110
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,608
Peace ain't gonna come
Till your death be done''

111
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,614
And then l'll lead her up to the roof

112
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,826
And l'll show her
All the shit she don't own

113
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:07,372
l'll lead her over to the edge
And leave her there all alone

114
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:28,676
Yo.

115
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:30,727
Yo, y'all wanna play that two on two?

116
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,607
Give that two on two?

117
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,896
Can l get the ball?

118
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,614
Can l get the ball?

119
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:43,030
l can't get the ball?

120
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,035
Could you throw me the ball, man?

121
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:47,655
Arif, Arif, you wanna
watch some ball, man?

122
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,238
Wanna play some hoop, huh?

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,994
No? Hoop, man. What?

124
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,124
ln the name of Allah, most gracious.

125
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:03,053
Oh, man, why you gotta do me
like this, man? Come on.

126
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,347
- He is Allah, the one and only.
- Come on, you know l would never

127
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,592
- Allah, the eternal.
- say that l wanted Said dead.

128
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,227
- The absolute.
- Please.

129
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,139
- He begets not.
- He's crazy, you know.

130
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:15,101
- Nor is he begotten.
- The medication gone to his head.

131
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:17,896
And there are none like unto him.

132
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:24,902
ln the name of Allah,
most gracious and most merciful.

133
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:32,623
Yo, Said. Said.

134
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,045
Don't fall asleep, brother,
you might not wake up.

135
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:53,301
Adebisi. Adebisi. Adebisi.

136
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,686
Yo, my African brother.
How you doing?

137
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,938
- Gotta talk to you.
- You and me?

138
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,316
- Yeah.
- Talk about what?

139
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:05,447
lt's about Said, man. He's responsible
for the death of Jefferson Keane.

140
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:09,070
Jefferson Keane?
Ancient history, baby.

141
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:12,906
Look, Said got to die.

142
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,499
l know what's going on, holy boy.

143
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,127
Yeah, l know they turned
their backs on you.

144
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:28,722
And you,

145
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,342
you think because we have
the same colour skin,

146
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,767
we have some connection.

147
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:47,783
Go, go, little man, go.

148
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:50,828
Try the man next door.

149
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,117
l'm telling you,

150
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:55,704
Said wanna start a riot up in here.

151
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,661
He wanna take over Oz.

152
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,960
Do you have any evidence?

153
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:02,378
No, just what he told me.

154
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:04,334
Well, we need
something more tangible.

155
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:06,793
Has there been
any stockpiling of weapons?

156
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:10,092
Just the usual jobs, homemade.

157
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,679
Mershah, why are you doing this?

158
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,719
Why are you giving up Said?

159
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:17,225
- l wanna stop the violence.
- That is bullshit.

160
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:19,556
- McManus.
- Leo, you know as well as l do

161
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,013
why he's here.

162
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:24,147
You're so fucking transparent,
it's laughable.

163
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,519
Officer,

164
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,610
- get him the fuck out of here.
- No, no, look, look. No, wait.

165
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,610
- l'm telling you, man...
- Out. Out. Go.

166
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:33,574
Get out!

167
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:36,904
His motive for betraying Said
isn't important.

168
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,412
His information is.

169
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:41,877
Leo, we're not gonna get anything
out of him.

170
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:45,173
He's clearly out of the loop. l wanna
move him to another cellblock.

171
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,215
- Why?
- Because l don't want the bad blood

172
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:50,636
that's happening between him and
Said to erupt into something bigger.

173
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,095
He's out.

174
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:54,808
All right.

175
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:56,934
When's the last shakedown
you had in Em City?

176
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,801
Couple of weeks ago.

177
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,228
Well, l think it's time for another.

178
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:04,522
Shakedown.

179
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,287
Look what l have.

180
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:50,113
Gentlemen, l can't put you all in the hole
because the hole is full right now,

181
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:52,399
and l can't transfer you
out of Emerald City

182
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:55,191
because all the cells in Oz
happen to be full too.

183
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,612
But what l can do
is take away your privileges.

184
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:02,991
No TV, no gym,
no phone calls for one month.

185
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:06,378
Gee, Dad, l hope l can still make it
to the prom.

186
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,965
Two months.

187
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:09,752
You happy, Alvarez?

188
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,343
That's all.

189
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,473
You know, looks like
everybody but Said has a weapon.

190
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,681
He ain't stupid.

191
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:31,321
Yo, who was the rat?

192
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:33,690
l hear it's Mershah.

193
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,233
You know something?

194
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:17,112
Kareem, you're supposed to be
an imam.

195
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,489
Teacher.

196
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,580
And all you taught me

197
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:25,698
was that your God is full of hate
and vengeance.

198
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:29,249
So you better watch out, okay?

199
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:34,041
Because he could turn on you
just like he turned on me.

200
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,445
You wanna kill a man?

201
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:56,063
Stick a shank in his chest.

202
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,004
You wanna torture a man?

203
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,006
Feed his loneliness.

204
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:18,424
Fiending for friendship, for peace,
he will search everywhere.

205
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,472
And when he realizes
that he won't find it,

206
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,260
he will destroy himself.

207
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,105
l have asked you here
because l'm a worried man.

208
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:38,281
The death of Huseni Mershah
is yet another example

209
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,193
of the brutality that we suffer here.

210
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,118
But his death was a suicide.

211
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,701
That is what the authorities
have claimed.

212
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:49,078
But what l know is, six men have died
under bizarre circumstances.

213
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,161
Suffocation.

214
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,745
Fire. Mutilation.

215
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:55,750
And the list continues on.

216
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,171
And Warden Glynn
sits in his office, aloof.

217
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,967
Now, the FBl was brought in
to do an investigation

218
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,717
but where is their report?

219
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,595
Are you saying it's been repressed?

220
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,646
l don't know.

221
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:12,098
l ask the question
in the hope that you,

222
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,108
the press,

223
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,147
can find out.

224
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:20,230
Because we prisoners of Oz, l believe,
will sit here waiting for answers

225
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,407
that never come.

226
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:26,867
The FBl investigation into the deaths at
Oswald State Penitentiary is ongoing.

227
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:30,367
We're not about to rush it just
to satisfy the media or the inmates.

228
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:34,168
We intend to do our work thoroughly
and completely.

229
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,753
Your little television show
got everybody's attention.

230
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,335
l'm afraid
that was your last performance.

231
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:41,130
l'm ordering a press blackout.

232
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:44,756
Warden, can't you see?

233
00:16:44,975 --> 00:16:49,019
Now, why is blackout
a big bad thing?

234
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,352
You can get whiteout
in a little bottle.

235
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:56,523
Don't be smug. Don't you be smug
with me, you son of a bitch.

236
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,984
From the first day you got here,
you have tried to destroy

237
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:03,827
everything that l built
and everything that l stand for.

238
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:07,487
Oh, that is pride.

239
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:10,367
l know that well.

240
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:13,253
McManus, you've given yourself
far too much importance.

241
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,546
You see, because
this thing's larger than you.

242
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,381
lt's larger than me.

243
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,833
So go ahead.
Take the media away.

244
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:22,251
Give us a blackout.

245
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:26,089
Censor our letters.
Tape our mouths shut.

246
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:31,437
There will always be a man
to tell the truth.

247
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:39,476
The truth will be heard.

248
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,943
May l go now?

249
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,069
Because it is time for me to pray.

250
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:57,129
Listen up, here are some new rules
from the warden.

251
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:02,713
As of today, no inmate will be allowed
to use prayer beads, prayer mats,

252
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,219
or special oils for religious
or other purposes.

253
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:10,725
lnmates will no longer be allowed
to wear similar clothing or head apparel

254
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:15,770
identifying them as a member
of any group, gang or cult.

255
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:21,106
No. No.

256
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:27,441
Now, you do realise this is a violation of
our right to freely practice our religion?

257
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,285
You can practice all you want.

258
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,370
Pray till the cows come home.

259
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:34,784
The constitution does not guarantee
that you, as a prisoner,

260
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,745
have the right to any stuff.

261
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:40,507
- Easy.
- You're gonna have to hand it over.

262
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:46,341
Look, this can go one of two ways.

263
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:48,713
l vote for no blood.

264
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:57,142
This is a meaningless gesture,
brothers.

265
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,564
Our faith is not in kufis,
beads or mats.

266
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,528
lt is in our hearts.

267
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:19,501
All right, everyone,
can l have your attention, please?

268
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:22,464
l've got some news for you all.

269
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:27,794
The FBl report will be released today
and it will state emphatically

270
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:33,636
that Sanchez, Ortolani, Post,
Martinez and Markstrom

271
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:36,972
were all killed by inmates.

272
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,850
Quiet down.

273
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:46,731
The death of Huseni Mershah
has been ruled a suicide.

274
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,574
Stop it.

275
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:56,742
Though it is likely that some correctional
officers may have been involved

276
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,710
in a secondary manner
with some of the murders.

277
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,295
Knock it off.

278
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,419
People, if you don't knock it off,
l'm not gonna be able to finish.

279
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:16,052
Fine.

280
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,160
We will stand up, look in the mirror,
and say, like Solomon:

281
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,796
l am black, but l am comely,
O ye daughters of Jerusalem.

282
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:50,383
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- Go. Go, go.

283
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,591
Mr. Said.

284
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,721
l just wanted to tell you

285
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:00,728
that the whole thing with the spoons,

286
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:04,432
the whole Allah thing, it's awesome.

287
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,828
So, what's up?

288
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,416
Turning Muslim on me?

289
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,667
He's a great speaker, that Said.

290
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:32,917
He says our lives are crap because
of Glynn and McManus and the rest.

291
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,838
Said says

292
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:39,474
that Glynn's guilty of worse crimes
than any of us have committed.

293
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,854
You ever kill anybody?

294
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:46,641
No, l ain't done nothing.

295
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,442
l got a bum rap, you know.

296
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,233
l'm innocent.

297
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:56,741
l thought it'd be hard
to murder my parents, but it wasn't.

298
00:21:56,912 --> 00:22:00,078
Hey, how did you whack them?

299
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:05,206
Ball-peen hammer.

300
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:13,709
Prisoner number 9 7 G4 1 4,
Donald Groves.

301
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,754
Convicted July 3, '97.
Two counts, murder in the first degree.

302
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,056
Sentence: Life imprisonment.

303
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:23,598
l think l should kill Warden Glynn.

304
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:28,980
- What?
- l think l ought to kill Glynn.

305
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:34,567
All right, look.
This is what you should do, all right?

306
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,443
You know that chick, Dr. Nathan?

307
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:40,160
All right, you go to her and you tell her
to write you a prescription.

308
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:43,865
l'm telling you, she's got me, like,
on these antidepressants right now,

309
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:46,076
and l'm like...

310
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:48,378
l'm sailing, man.

311
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:50,421
No.

312
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:53,965
My first idea is best.

313
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:57,180
Next chance l get, l'll murder Glynn.

314
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:01,930
- Look out.
- No.

315
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:10,772
Donald Groves.
Convicted August 2 1, '9 7.

316
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:15,191
Murder in the first degree in the death
of corrections officer Lawrence Smith.

317
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:18,076
Sentence: Death.

318
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,409
This is genocide.

319
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:25,243
Killing murderers is genocide.

320
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:31,337
Groves?

321
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:33,747
- They beat me.
- Who?

322
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:43,511
Groves, you have been
condemned to die

323
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,476
for the murder of Officer Smith.

324
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:49,056
The state gives you the right to choose
any method you wish to die.

325
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,725
l shouldn't even be talking to you.

326
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:54,694
You should be dead.

327
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,107
You were the one
that was supposed to die.

328
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:58,907
How do you wanna die, Groves?

329
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:00,777
Lethal injection?
Electric chair?

330
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,912
- Firing squad.
- Firing squad?

331
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:05,664
lsn't that what they do to assassins?

332
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:11,374
Fine. l'm going to personally
paint the target on your heart.

333
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:14,548
Warden. Warden.

334
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:19,426
Me killing you
wasn't personal, you know.

335
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,756
lt just had to be done.

336
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:29,811
When your shift's over,
come to my office.

337
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:33,890
l want you to tell me
why l shouldn't fire your asses.

338
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:38,486
Lawrence Smith
was an outstanding officer.

339
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:41,867
He was an outstanding human being.

340
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:45,280
And he died
for what he truly believed in:

341
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:47,205
Justice.

342
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,203
l think it would be easier to get angry.

343
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,956
To punish all the inmates
for a crime committed by one of them.

344
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:04,887
But knowing Lawrence, l don't think
that he would want his death

345
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:08,094
to bring about more pain,
more suffering.

346
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:20,313
l think that he would want his death
to bring about...

347
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,069
...peace.

348
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:39,000
- Wanna get a drink?
- No, no, l got a press conference.

349
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:41,133
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Warden?

350
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,673
Yes, Eddie?

351
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,260
Did l hear right?
Groves wants a firing squad?

352
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,098
Yeah. The sick bastard.

353
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:49,136
Do we have a firing squad?

354
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:51,310
No, l gotta put one together.

355
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:53,561
Well, l'd like to volunteer.

356
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:57,767
- Why?
- Smitty was my friend.

357
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:01,982
You know, in this case, l'm not sure
that's a good enough reason. l mean,

358
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:05,283
this isn't about revenge,
it's about the law.

359
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:10,621
But l'll get back to you.

360
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,128
- Gloria, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah. You're done.

361
00:26:16,338 --> 00:26:19,422
Look around. We've got a bumper crop
of officer-related injuries.

362
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,291
O'Reily. What happened?

363
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:25,761
He hit me.
l wasn't doing dick, l swear.

364
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,840
- Just ups and hits me.
- Who?

365
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:31,842
Yeah, right. l tell you,
and next time l get hit worse.

366
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:36,890
Leo, look, since Smith's murder,
this ER's SRO.

367
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:39,434
Your officers are out of control.
You gotta do something.

368
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,817
l know, l know.

369
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,655
l know.

370
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:45,531
You know. Jesus.

371
00:26:46,076 --> 00:26:48,318
Are you saying that random reprisals
are justified?

372
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,823
Yeah.

373
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:52,570
Well, one person
killed Lawrence Smith.

374
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,665
Groves. The other inmates
are innocent.

375
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:56,578
lnnocent? Christ.

376
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:59,209
- l didn't expect you to understand.
- What do you mean?

377
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:01,498
You were never a guard, huh?

378
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:04,213
You didn't come up through the ranks
like Leo, me or the rest.

379
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:08,799
So l don't understand the anger,
the frustration that COs go through?

380
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:10,759
- That's fucking bullshit.
- Look, Leo,

381
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,345
you cannot keep suspending these guys
because they slap some dipshit around.

382
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:17,101
- l can't condone it either.
- We're understaffed as it is.

383
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:19,557
You take experienced officers
off of the rotation,

384
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:22,819
what are you leaving us with?
Newbies who can't handle a crisis.

385
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:24,310
So, what do you suggest l do?

386
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:26,856
Just let our guys get through
Groves' execution.

387
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:29,359
Once he's in a body bag,
this whole thing will fade away.

388
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,616
So in the meantime,
they whale on whoever they want.

389
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,536
Reality's hard for you,
isn't it, McManus?

390
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:53,923
Hi.

391
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:56,599
l'm Officer Gordon Wood.
Here to replace Vogelsang.

392
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,052
Well, hi.

393
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:01,517
Vogelsang is a good man
but he can't control his temper.

394
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:04,190
- How long you been working in Oz?
- Three weeks.

395
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:06,155
Veteran, huh?

396
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,987
Okay. lf you got questions, ask.

397
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,952
lt doesn't make you stupid.
lt may save both our lives.

398
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:15,745
l hear you. ls that Kareem Said?

399
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:17,374
Yep, in the flesh.

400
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:22,046
- He don't look so tough.
- Yeah, well, looks are deceiving.

401
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:29,296
My laundry interest you?

402
00:28:29,513 --> 00:28:34,969
Yeah, l always wondered,
a famous guy like Kareem Said,

403
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:37,557
is he a Fruit of the Loom
or a Hanes man?

404
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:41,098
- l don't wear underwear.
- Oh, l see.

405
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:44,192
- You like the wide-open spaces, huh?
- That's right.

406
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,603
Oh, well.

407
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:05,788
lt is with enormous sadness
and respect

408
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:09,169
that l present to Loretta Smith
the Fleishman Medal of Honour

409
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:12,055
in memory of her son,

410
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:14,387
Officer Lawrence Smith,

411
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:16,930
who died in the service
of this great state.

412
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:19,141
Mrs. Smith, do you believe
justice has been served?

413
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,396
l would like to be able
to watch the execution.

414
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,645
Mrs. Smith, l don't think
that's a good idea.

415
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:31,730
Besides, the state doesn't allow
family members to be present.

416
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:37,120
lf l could help, believe me, l would.

417
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:41,282
Can l see Groves?

418
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:44,791
l'm not sure what good that'll do.

419
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:48,088
l'm not sure either.

420
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,257
But you're gonna kill him.

421
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:55,720
And he'll be dead and buried,
and l won't get another chance.

422
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:08,227
l'm Loretta Smith.

423
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:10,851
You killed my son.

424
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:17,447
You're a handsome fellow.

425
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:20,865
Thanks.

426
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:24,908
You broke God's law:
Love thy neighbour.

427
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,831
l wanna hate you but l can't.

428
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:37,842
l feel pity, tears, but no hate.

429
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,144
l didn't realise that
until this moment.

430
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:51,267
You are my neighbour
and l love you.

431
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:54,196
And l forgive you...

432
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:57,156
...with all my heart.

433
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:03,081
That's all.

434
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:16,588
l wanna thank you gentlemen
for volunteering

435
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:19,432
to serve on the firing squad.

436
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:23,092
Since we announced to the press
that Groves chose this method,

437
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,143
we've been swamped
with phone calls

438
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:27,271
from sharpshooters
all over the country

439
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,769
wanting to sign up.

440
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:31,475
But the warden and l felt it best

441
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:35,562
if we handled this internally.

442
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:37,360
Warden?

443
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:42,403
There hasn't been an execution by
firing squad in this state since 1 872.

444
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:46,454
Fortunately, Lenny Burrano worked
in Utah before coming to Oswald.

445
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:49,117
- Lenny?
- Thank you, warden.

446
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:53,668
Now, many people will tell you
that firing squads are barbaric.

447
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:59,044
But in fact, it's a lot more humane
than the electric chair.

448
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,092
ln any case,

449
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:05,352
the protocol for a successful execution
is proper lighting, proper distance.

450
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:08,762
But you must prepare yourself
for the emotional burden

451
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,933
of actually pulling the trigger.

452
00:32:11,151 --> 00:32:14,436
Now, you should know,
that one of the rifles will carry blanks,

453
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:18,106
so that none of you will ever know
who actually fired the fatal shot.

454
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:31,170
Hello? He what?

455
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,998
l'll be right down.

456
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:37,625
- Patient's name is Donald Groves.
- Let's put down an NG tube,

457
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:39,213
- pump his stomach.
- What happened?

458
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:40,763
- Overdose.
- ls he going to live?

459
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:42,259
Ask me again in 20 minutes.

460
00:32:42,432 --> 00:32:44,140
Save him, doctor.
Did you strip-search him?

461
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,017
- Yes.
- How the fuck did he get pills?

462
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:47,514
- l don't know.
- Find out!

463
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,395
We're losing him. Start CPR.

464
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:51,106
- Save the little prick.
- What's the difference?

465
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,596
He's scheduled to die anyway.

466
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:55,101
The law says he has to be aware
that he's being executed,

467
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:57,769
he has to know why he's
being executed. He has to be alive.

468
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,697
So save him.

469
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:02,695
Save his goddamn ass.

470
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,962
Yo, Rebadow,
what are you doing in here all day?

471
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,831
Hiding.

472
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:17,383
Any word on Groves?

473
00:33:18,218 --> 00:33:21,005
Yeah, Dr. Nathan
brought him back from the dead.

474
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:22,466
A resurrection, huh?

475
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:27,219
Yeah. They delayed execution
for a couple of hours.

476
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:31,727
- You miss him, don't you?
- Groves?

477
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:33,392
No.

478
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,147
l've learned over the years
not to make attachments.

479
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,653
lf you do, you spend
all your time grieving.

480
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:41,193
You know what,

481
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:46,075
l ain't grieving, but it's a hell
of a lot better than hiding, man.

482
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,212
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

483
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:02,262
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy--

484
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:03,923
- Father?
- Yeah?

485
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:06,887
Yeah, l've been thinking
a lot about my final words.

486
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,968
And l decided what l wanted to say.

487
00:34:10,437 --> 00:34:13,010
And l'd like you to write it down
and give it to Mrs. Smith.

488
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:17,816
lt'll maybe make her
feel better. Okay?

489
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,444
Will you do that for me?

490
00:34:21,156 --> 00:34:22,864
Of course.

491
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,652
l think that she'd appreciate that.

492
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:29,579
lt's time.

493
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:51,013
The sky's a nice colour of blue.

494
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:26,302
May the blessing of God, the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit,

495
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,174
come upon you
and remain with you forever.

496
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:54,078
- l just have to hear his last words.
- You can listen through this.

497
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:55,952
Great.

498
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,837
- Do you have any last words?
- What's wrong?

499
00:36:10,056 --> 00:36:13,176
l just wanna say that l did...

500
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,220
- What's he saying?
- l don't know. l can't--

501
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:17,139
Can you fix that?

502
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:34,330
He's dead.

503
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:36,656
No, what did he say?
What were his last words?

504
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,371
l don't know. l wasn't really listening.

505
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:58,058
Drinking on the job, Eddie?

506
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:00,147
No.

507
00:37:00,357 --> 00:37:02,314
l'm off duty,

508
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:05,941
as of ten minutes ago.

509
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:09,406
Want some?

510
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:13,192
No, l never developed
a taste for Mogen David.

511
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:15,614
Snob.

512
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:20,075
To Lawrence Smith.

513
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,369
A fine man who died too young.

514
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,580
Yeah. Amen.

515
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,381
Here's to Donald Groves,

516
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:35,469
a freak of nature who lived too long.

517
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:37,095
Yeah, probably.

518
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:43,772
l killed a man who killed a man.

519
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:48,437
l killed a man.

520
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:54,984
Only maybe l didn't kill him, because
they put blanks in one of the rifles

521
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:59,029
so maybe-- l mean, l can never
know for sure if l killed him or not.

522
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:04,746
Only not knowing
is maybe worse than knowing.

523
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,545
- Because at least if l knew--
- Eddie.

524
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,922
Go home. Sleep it off.

525
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,423
Sleep, yeah.

526
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,933
Something tells me l'm not gonna
sleep much tonight either.

527
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:29,356
''The best laid schemes of mice
and men...''

528
00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:31,896
l don't get the mice part.

529
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:35,531
Were the mice back in Burns' time
smart enough to make a plan?

530
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:38,661
We got mice in Oz
but they don't seem too bright.

531
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:41,161
lt's the rats you gotta look out for.

532
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:44,292
Our rats come in all shapes and sizes.

533
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,604
Who the fuck's that?

534
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:10,145
Some hotshot highbrow cellist.

535
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:12,853
l guess he's a hotshot, because
McManus gave him permission

536
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,783
to practice for an hour every day.

537
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:18,910
So l gotta stay in here
and listen to him.

538
00:39:19,412 --> 00:39:23,873
- What's he playing?
- l don't know. l'm a Beck fan myself.

539
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,726
Prisoner number 9 7D403,
Eugene Dobbins.

540
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:49,349
Convicted August 1 8, '9 7.
Murder in the second degree.

541
00:39:49,568 --> 00:39:53,565
Sentence: 22 years.
Up for parole in eight.

542
00:39:54,197 --> 00:39:56,819
This cello was made in 1 7 44

543
00:39:56,992 --> 00:39:59,743
by a man named Johannes Kipers
in Amsterdam.

544
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:01,281
lt's good, huh?

545
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:03,703
Yeah, it's good. lt's priceless to me.

546
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:06,952
That's why we keep it locked
in the chaplain's office.

547
00:40:07,836 --> 00:40:09,793
lt sure is beautiful.

548
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:12,548
Beautiful but lonely.

549
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:15,961
Lonely?
How does a cello get lonely?

550
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:18,467
l have no one to play with.

551
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:22,007
You sound great by yourself.
You don't need anybody to play with.

552
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:24,052
l'm used to playing
with symphony orchestras,

553
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:26,267
90 to 1 00 other musicians
making music.

554
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,389
A cello by itself is just...

555
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,599
lt's just not the same.

556
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:41,821
Kenny.

557
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:44,199
You got any tits, man?

558
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,534
- Hey, where you going?
- l'll catch you later, man.

559
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,873
Come hit this before you go.

560
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:51,669
- l gotta go to the bathroom.
- Come on.

561
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,587
- Brother, l gotta pee.
- Don't be a pussy. Hit it. Come on.

562
00:40:58,094 --> 00:40:59,754
Hit it good.

563
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:01,965
There you go.

564
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:10,561
- Everything l say stays here, right?
- You have to ask?

565
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:14,685
- Jackson Vahue.
- Yeah, the basketball star.

566
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:18,322
Yeah, when he got to Em City,
l was excited, you know.

567
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,901
l mean, he's always been my hero.

568
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:23,859
You don't want him to think you're
a wimp so when he snorts, you snort.

569
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,538
Something like that.

570
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:27,906
But l'm not hooked again,
Sister, l swear.

571
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:30,829
Well, you keep doing it, you will be.

572
00:41:31,044 --> 00:41:32,538
- l'm gonna talk to Vahue.
- No.

573
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:34,088
No, no. lt's okay.

574
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:36,581
l'll figure out a way to confront him
about his drug use

575
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:38,751
without implicating you.
And you, meanwhile,

576
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:42,592
you come to the counselling session
on Thursday.

577
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:45,475
And stop doing heroin,
no matter what Vahue says.

578
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:47,095
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

579
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:55,482
You know, maybe it's time
you got yourself another hero.

580
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,650
Because, to be honest,

581
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:01,189
the one you've got sucks.

582
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:04,409
You gonna do what l tell you to do
or l'm just gonna fuck you up.

583
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:06,950
Yo, Jackson,
you leave Dobbins alone, man.

584
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:09,079
You butt out of this, all right?

585
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,410
- l'm telling you, man.
- Yo, fuck-- Fuck you.

586
00:42:12,669 --> 00:42:14,377
Hey.

587
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,995
Get the fuck out of here, man.

588
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,050
- Damn. What the fuck was that about?
- You're so wired on tits

589
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,840
- you was hurting him for no reason.
- l don't need no reason.

590
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,842
He got a gift, man.
lf you fuck with it, it will go.

591
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:29,011
What about my gift, huh?
What about my fucking gift?

592
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:31,599
- l'm dying in here, man.
- We all dying, Jackson.

593
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:33,479
That ain't no comfort.

594
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:39,313
We all got problems.

595
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:42,151
lmpossible problems.

596
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:45,740
And then we meet someone who's
got bigger problems than we have.

597
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:48,704
Or at least, they can't handle
their problems as well.

598
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:53,908
And somehow,
their weakness gives us strength.

599
00:42:55,337 --> 00:42:58,291
Simple truth number 62:

600
00:42:58,757 --> 00:43:03,051
You help someone,
you help yourself.

601
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,699
So l did
what Sister Peter Marie said.

602
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:30,869
l got myself another hero.

603
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,908
And who'd have guessed?

604
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:37,249
lt's me. Yeah.

605
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:39,830
l'm proud because my plan worked.

606
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:41,791
l did my best.

607
00:43:46,388 --> 00:43:49,839
But unfortunately for Dobbins,
my best,

608
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:52,134
it ain't good enough.

609
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:03,692
Hey, Nino,
you wanna play some pinochle?

610
00:44:03,905 --> 00:44:06,657
l'm in the middle
of a conversation here.

611
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,990
What fucking bog
did you grow up on,

612
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:11,237
you stupid mick bastard?

613
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,696
Now get the fuck out of here.

614
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,614
- Hey, O'Reily?
- What?

615
00:44:16,793 --> 00:44:19,628
- What are those two talking about?
- How the fuck would l know, Ross?

616
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:22,287
Seems strange to you?
Nino Schibetta, fucking mob guy,

617
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,126
chatting with the nigger of lslam?

618
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:27,676
Get lost. Come here.

619
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:31,964
- l've been hearing shit.
- Yeah, me too.

620
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:34,260
- The Muslims are gonna start a riot.
- Yeah.

621
00:44:34,478 --> 00:44:36,600
Rumour has it
that they're armed to the teeth.

622
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:39,559
l'm talking guns.
They've organized every cellblock.

623
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:43,475
They take charge, me and you
can kiss our white asses goodbye.

624
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:46,151
Well, maybe Schibetta's
making some kind of deal with Said.

625
00:44:46,323 --> 00:44:48,150
How come we don't know about it?

626
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:51,202
Maybe the old wop's saving himself
by giving you up.

627
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:53,536
You're right.
We need to get organized.

628
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:57,074
Definitely. And you got a card
in your deck nobody knows about.

629
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,450
What, Adebisi?

630
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,378
He hates Said as much as we do.

631
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:05,205
Wouldn't hurt to have
a couple of homeboys on our side.

632
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:06,926
All right, l'll talk to him.

633
00:45:11,848 --> 00:45:13,426
- You ready?
- Almost.

634
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:16,477
Look, l saw Said talking to Schibetta.

635
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:20,102
You think Said knows about the two
of us putting glass in Schibetta's food?

636
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:21,774
How would he know?

637
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:25,774
Listen, you hear any rumblings about
the Muslims wanting to start a riot?

638
00:45:25,946 --> 00:45:27,226
Stop that.

639
00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:30,116
- Sure, you know.
- Well, if it happens,

640
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:31,605
where you gonna land?

641
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:33,487
On my feet, as always.

642
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:37,535
Hey, we supply tits
to this whole fucking prison, all right?

643
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:39,783
Those doilyheads
are gonna gun for us.

644
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:43,002
- Don't worry, bro, l got your back.
- That's all l needed to know.

645
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:45,122
How long is it gonna take
before he dies?

646
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:48,881
l don't know. lt's not exactly an exact
science, you know what l'm saying.

647
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:51,630
l want him...

648
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:53,305
...dead.

649
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:08,068
Here you go, Nino.

650
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,947
- What, you don't like it?
- No.

651
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:14,275
- l'll get you something else.
- l'm just not hungry.

652
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:16,279
- ls your stomach still bothering you?
- Yeah.

653
00:46:16,496 --> 00:46:19,201
l told you to go to the doctor.

654
00:46:22,294 --> 00:46:25,330
We got a huge pair of tits
coming in tomorrow.

655
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:32,042
Tell your pal, Adebisi,
to get his boys ready to run.

656
00:46:32,262 --> 00:46:35,465
You got it. Say, Nino,

657
00:46:36,057 --> 00:46:37,682
anything going down
l should know about?

658
00:46:37,851 --> 00:46:40,057
You know,
between us and Said, l mean?

659
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:42,307
No.

660
00:46:43,023 --> 00:46:45,146
But you would know...

661
00:46:46,276 --> 00:46:48,601
...when you're supposed to know.

662
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:52,565
l'm gonna go lie down.

663
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:58,490
Hey, Dobbins, you want a salad?

664
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:11,007
Flush and 40 jacks.

665
00:47:11,218 --> 00:47:14,421
l got a marriage and l got 1 00 aces.

666
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:16,222
Nino.

667
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,677
Jesus Christ.

668
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:21,720
What the fuck is that?

669
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:24,225
Jesus.

670
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,232
What the fuck?

671
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:30,152
Nino. Nino.

672
00:47:31,863 --> 00:47:34,650
Hey, you don't look so good.

673
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:38,153
Christ.

674
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:40,031
Hello, Kareem.

675
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,957
Guess you heard
what happened to Schibetta.

676
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,961
Oh, yes.
Now, that was unusual.

677
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:48,791
The man was haemorrhaging
throughout his body.

678
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:50,416
Now, l wonder what caused that.

679
00:47:50,674 --> 00:47:53,840
- Bad diet.
- Too much garlic.

680
00:47:54,845 --> 00:47:56,303
ls the man gonna recover?

681
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:58,760
The doctor says he's got a chance.

682
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:01,132
But meanwhile...

683
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,847
...we are in charge of his operation.

684
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:07,601
So any business you had with him,
has to go through us.

685
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:10,063
Business?
l had no business with Schibetta.

686
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:12,643
- Yeah.
- Better not be lying.

687
00:48:12,863 --> 00:48:15,982
- ls that a warning?
- Yeah.

688
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:17,991
Well, l have a warning
for the two of you.

689
00:48:18,201 --> 00:48:21,404
Change your ways
or you will suffer the wrath of God.

690
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:24,577
God? l don't see any God.

691
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,867
- He's not here.
- All l see is you.

692
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:29,078
You have a bad heart.

693
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:31,205
You have it so wrong.

694
00:48:31,423 --> 00:48:33,629
l have a weak heart.

695
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,627
And you...

696
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,920
...have the bad heart.

697
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:40,261
You can keep my watch.

698
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,934
He's right.
You do have a bad heart.

699
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:48,011
What can l say?
l'm a bad-heart motherfucker.

700
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:53,352
l'll take this one.

701
00:48:57,032 --> 00:48:58,692
Hey, Nino.

702
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:02,159
Remember when you called me
a stupid mick bastard?

703
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,701
l ain't so stupid now, am l?

704
00:49:06,374 --> 00:49:07,999
Open up.

705
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:11,211
Sorry, we're out of tomatoes.

706
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,092
lf you listen to the poets,

707
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,676
they'll tell you that a big bad event
in someone's life changes them.

708
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:23,885
lf you lose the woman you love
or your legs,

709
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,552
you suddenly find
a kind of beauty inside yourself.

710
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:30,262
That's what they say, the poets.

711
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:33,518
Truth is, you don't.

712
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:36,733
After a big bad event,

713
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:40,150
you only become
more of the person you already were.

714
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:52,537
- Yeah, motherfucker!
- You're gonna die, fucking bastard!

715
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:55,126
Fucking bitch!
How's that feel, you fuck?

716
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:57,800
Beecher, you're a dead man!

717
00:49:57,968 --> 00:49:59,877
lf you're afraid Schillinger's
gonna kill you,

718
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:03,089
- l'll place you under protective custody.
- Fuck off. Fuck off.

719
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:06,764
Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.

720
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:08,929
Fuck off.

721
00:50:09,146 --> 00:50:12,016
lt's after a big bad event
that you find out the real person

722
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,860
you always were inside.

723
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:21,737
Look what that cocksucker did to me.

724
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,488
Turned me into Jolly fucking Roger,

725
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:27,704
only l'm not
feeling real jolly right now.

726
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:31,414
Well, Dr. Nathan says that there's
a chance they can still save your eye.

727
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:34,827
Always looking for the upside,
huh, McManus?

728
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:37,502
Beecher's gonna get out
of the hole soon

729
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:40,385
and it's very clear that l can't have
both of you in Emerald City,

730
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:42,295
so l'm trying to decide who stays.

731
00:50:42,512 --> 00:50:45,597
Well, let's see now. He's the crazy fuck
who came at me.

732
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:48,298
He's the fuck who shattered the glass
that went into my eye.

733
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:50,262
Are you saying his actions
were unprovoked?

734
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:53,266
- lf l say yes, would you believe me?
- No.

735
00:50:54,816 --> 00:50:56,773
The two of you,
you're the same fucking guy.

736
00:50:57,194 --> 00:50:58,308
What? Me and Beecher?

737
00:50:58,528 --> 00:51:01,778
You know what it's like
being able to see out of one eye?

738
00:51:02,657 --> 00:51:04,780
Your point of view gets twisted.

739
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:09,699
You can see straight
but you can't see as far around.

740
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:12,163
What you see is not only what's there.

741
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:14,832
What's that got to do with me
being like Beecher?

742
00:51:15,837 --> 00:51:19,965
You eggheads think the world really is
the way you see it.

743
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:24,797
And then when you finally figure out
that it's not, that you weren't even close,

744
00:51:25,806 --> 00:51:27,798
then you get a little bitter.

745
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:29,766
You get mean.

746
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:35,556
l think you better go live in gen pop
for a while.

747
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:37,143
Fine.

748
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:46,486
Well, well. Look who's back.

749
00:51:51,915 --> 00:51:55,331
Hey, prag,
Schillinger sends his love.

750
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:57,121
Get the fuck off.

751
00:51:57,337 --> 00:51:58,831
Hey.

752
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:00,838
Break it up.

753
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:12,970
Beecher, you wanted to see me?

754
00:52:13,186 --> 00:52:15,594
l need you to move me
to another cellblock.

755
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:18,186
All the cellblocks are full.

756
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:21,231
Then move me to another prison.

757
00:52:21,444 --> 00:52:24,362
Do l look like a travel agent to you?

758
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:28,026
Beecher.

759
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:32,663
What?

760
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,752
Nothing.

761
00:53:44,194 --> 00:53:45,772
You're gonna die.

762
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:47,897
Not today.

763
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,490
That hurt.

764
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:56,699
That was nice.

765
00:53:56,873 --> 00:53:59,411
Tie that Nazi bastard up.

766
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:03,127
Tie that motherfucking Nazi up.

767
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:05,876
Beecher. Come on, baby.
Come on.

768
00:54:14,808 --> 00:54:17,762
Hey, motherfucker,
you remember this?

769
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,227
Oh, shit. He's shitting on his--

770
00:54:30,323 --> 00:54:31,901
Sieg heil, baby.

771
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:34,483
Sieg fucking heil.

772
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:37,572
We think we know what we need.

773
00:54:37,747 --> 00:54:40,535
We spend our time figuring out
how to get what we want,

774
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:43,200
who can help us, who's in the way.

775
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,709
We make our moves,
and sometimes we get lucky.

776
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:48,045
We get exactly what we want.

777
00:54:48,258 --> 00:54:50,132
And life gets worse.

778
00:54:50,343 --> 00:54:52,751
Simple truth number 22:

779
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:54,880
Be careful what you wish for,
brother.

780
00:54:55,098 --> 00:54:58,348
Be very, very careful.
