1
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:40,505
"'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house...

2
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,606
"not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."

3
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:49,078
The rats, on the other hand,
is a whole different story.

4
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:58,388
Said, I got a little gift for you here.

5
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:08,369
- Okay, what've we got?
- I was bitten by a rat.

6
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,875
Jesus! Can you take that?

7
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:15,438
Lie back.

8
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,440
Christmas Eve.

9
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,183
I think it's snowing.

10
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:25,022
When I was a boy,
this was the best night of all.

11
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:29,184
Our house was full of music,
lights, food, cousins.

12
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:33,231
- Em City is so empty.
- Sure it is.

13
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,904
We're in the middle of a lockdown
because the Aryans attacked the Muslims.

14
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:42,268
I'm getting a premonition like I used to
when God would talk to me.

15
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,435
God would talk to you?

16
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:48,777
- He'd tell me what was going to happen.
- And is he talking to you now?

17
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,481
So what's he saying?

18
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,218
He says:

19
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:56,319
"Be afraid."

20
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:01,392
<i>Eugene, Miguel asked you a question.</i>

21
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,726
<i>Can you forgive him?</i>

22
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,290
I talked to Eugene and Tina yesterday...

23
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:44,560
and they've decided they don't want
to continue with the program.

24
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:49,837
Too bad.

25
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,743
You know, I had a lot of things
that I wanted to say to them.

26
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,748
- You could say them to me.
- It's not the same thing.

27
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,714
Of course not. I understand.

28
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:07,425
There are certain things you should only say
to certain people...

29
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,628
like the warden.

30
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:16,292
He's expecting you to tell him
who raped his daughter.

31
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,973
- Are you prepared to do that?
- No.

32
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:30,139
- Miguel, do you want to go back to solitary?
- No.

33
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:37,552
Then my advice...

34
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:41,084
is that you take this day...

35
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,018
pray to God...

36
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:45,587
Iook within...

37
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,062
and make a choice.

38
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:56,840
May Almighty God bless you in the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

39
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,937
The Mass has ended.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

40
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:06,041
- Hallelujah, hallelujah.
- Thanks be to God. Hallelujah.

41
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,911
- Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

42
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:18,791
Yo, <i>hermano</i>.

43
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,865
I hear Glynn is letting Hernandez, Guerra,
and Ricardo back into Emerald City.

44
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,433
- Lf I was you, I'd watch my ass.
- Why is that?

45
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,298
I saw how when they got busted,
you walked away.

46
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,039
That's not too cool, bro,
deserting your amigos like that.

47
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,808
Why don't you leave me the fuck alone?

48
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:39,580
Hernandez is gonna be in a nasty-ass mood,
looking to take it out on someone.

49
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,886
- My sister will be here to see me.
- Yeah, you sure?

50
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,791
Yeah, she knows how much
I love Christmas.

51
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:03,505
- Miguelito, <i>feliz Navidad</i>.
- Where'd you disappear to, man?

52
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,242
What do you mean, "disappear"?

53
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,075
All four of us are together,
only three of us are cuffed.

54
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,207
Come on, guys. Back up, man.

55
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,619
You gotta forgive them, Miguelito.

56
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:17,753
They had a lot of time to themselves
to wonder about things.

57
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:21,022
But me, I don't wonder.

58
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,986
I know.

59
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,659
You're not one of us.

60
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,164
You never will be.

61
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:35,403
Why is it I get nervous seeing the four
of you huddled in this pod together?

62
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,137
Whoever don't live here, come on, vamoose.

63
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:39,905
Let's go!

64
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,575
Hernandez, for Christ's sake, it's Christmas.

65
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,880
Take a break from being a tough guy.

66
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:54,925
He's right.

67
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,154
Enjoy the day.

68
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,435
It will be your last.

69
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,774
I made up my mind.

70
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:19,842
I'm not gonna tell the warden
anything about his daughter's rape.

71
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,451
Are you sure about this?
Have you really thought it through?

72
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,791
I wanna go back to solitary.

73
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:39,198
I'll make the arrangements.
Transfer you out first thing tomorrow.

74
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,469
- No, not tomorrow. I wanna go right now.
- Transfers take time.

75
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:46,638
- Fuck that. I wanna go right now.
- Why, Miguel, are you in danger?

76
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,774
Because if you are,
we can put you in protective custody.

77
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,846
What difference does it make?
Alone is alone.

78
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:59,725
It's the way I've been my whole fucking life.
I just don't belong in the world.

79
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,191
Belong by myself.

80
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,698
Solitary.

81
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,865
- She coming?
- She's not on the list.

82
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,440
Check it again.

83
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,573
Ricardo, I double-checked it.

84
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:26,051
Your sister didn't schedule a visit.
Nobody in your family did.

85
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,428
Carlo, it's time.

86
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,581
- You leaving us, Alvarez?
- Before that, we wanna give you something.

87
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:10,318
First day I got here, I got stuck.
Remember, you fucking cocksucker?

88
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,862
Drop it! I said drop it!

89
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,407
Ricardo's dead.

90
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,633
Lockdown!

91
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,544
Let's go, come on! Move it!

92
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,745
Seasons Greetings, fuckwad.

93
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,864
Alvarez is back in solitary.
I guess the circle is complete.

94
00:09:57,543 --> 00:10:01,035
- Ray, I am so sorry.
- Sorry?

95
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,746
Is this an official confession?

96
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:09,216
I should never have excluded you.
Maybe if you had attended the sessions...

97
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:13,055
with Alvarez and Rivera,
things might have ended up differently.

98
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:14,491
I doubt it.

99
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:20,557
There goes the baby Jesus,
back in the box for another year.

100
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,695
And the wise men:

101
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,402
Larry, Curly, and Moe.

102
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:33,245
Pete, have you absolutely decided
to stop being a nun?

103
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:39,617
The process of getting out
is just as hard as getting in.

104
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,944
So by the time I'm done, who knows?

105
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,890
I admire your courage.

106
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:51,459
Sometimes it takes
just as much courage to stay...

107
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,026
- as to go.
- Maybe.

108
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,594
But if the Magi had stayed in Persia...

109
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,401
did what they were supposed to do,
followed all the rules...

110
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,106
they never would have seen God.

111
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:07,838
Thank you.

112
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:14,346
I got word at home
that you wanted to see me...

113
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,116
that you wanted to talk about
Ardith's attacker.

114
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,557
So you wanna know who raped her, right?

115
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,289
Yes.

116
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:27,991
Why?

117
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,027
So they can be punished.

118
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:37,068
What if I told you that the one who did it
has already been punished?

119
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,839
The name. I want the name.

120
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,376
Carlo Ricardo.

121
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,818
He's been here the whole time.

122
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,050
I'm sorry about your brother.

123
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:26,352
- Did you know him?
- No.

124
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:30,662
Carlo could never rest.

125
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:38,863
Maybe finally now he'll get some.

126
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,439
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen</i>

127
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:50,073
<i>Let nothing you dismay</i>

128
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,880
<i>Remember Christ our Savior</i>

129
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,320
<i>Was born on Christmas day</i>

130
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:01,759
<i>To save us all from Satan's power</i>

131
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:04,922
<i>When we were gone astray</i>

132
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:10,625
<i>O tidings of comfort and joy</i>

133
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:13,098
<i>Comfort and joy</i>

134
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:19,145
<i>O tidings of comfort and joy</i>

135
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:27,476
I was supposed to die this Thursday,
the last execution of the millennium.

136
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:32,989
But the Governor heard that I'm pregnant,
and an hour ago he issued a temporary stay.

137
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:38,729
Knowing Devlin, he's just trying...

138
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:42,666
to sort through the political ramifications
of putting to death...

139
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:46,364
a woman who got pregnant while in prison.

140
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,705
- You do know who the father is?
- Yes, of course.

141
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,767
- But you won't tell?
- No.

142
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:57,271
- The list is easy to pare down.
- The father doesn't matter.

143
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,456
I want you to go to the Governor and
tell him to go forward with the execution.

144
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:10,485
- You want to die?
- I have to die.

145
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:15,295
- Why?
- I did kill my firstborn.

146
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,371
I've said it.

147
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:25,239
Some things aren't real
till you say them out loud.

148
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,107
I know.

149
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:31,415
My daughter.

150
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,417
My precious.

151
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,553
When she was born, she was a joy.

152
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:42,259
But bit by bit, I began to see that there was
something not quite right about her.

153
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:45,664
Something not quite human.

154
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,190
Otherworldly.

155
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:55,937
I'd go into her room, and above the bassinet
there'd be flashes of fire.

156
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,202
Fire?

157
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:02,573
Or she'd speak in tongues.
One day, she even made a plate levitate.

158
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:08,075
That's when I began to see
she was possessed of the devil.

159
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:15,084
- Did you ever talk to anyone about this?
- Who could I tell?

160
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:20,360
My mother? The child's father,
that lying bastard?

161
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:27,305
- Your minister? Pediatrician?
- They would have thought I was crazy.

162
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,669
No, I knew the only way
was to kill her myself.

163
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,805
But every time I went to strike,
I didn't see the devil.

164
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,444
I only saw my daughter's sweet face.

165
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:46,482
So I put her in the car...

166
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:50,225
<i>and drove into the lake and let her drown...</i>

167
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,526
half hoping, half expecting...

168
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,057
to see her rise up out of the water
on Lucifer's back.

169
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:06,843
- All right. I'll see what I can do.
- God bless you.

170
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:13,416
In three hours, I'm hosting a party
at the mansion for close to 400 people.

171
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:17,752
- What's all this about Shirley Bellinger?
- She wants to be executed.

172
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,587
Good. That solves all my problems.

173
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:25,860
- A little something extra under the tree.
- Excuse me, Governor, but there's one hitch.

174
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,398
She's insane.

175
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:32,793
- She drowned her daughter. We knew that.
- The woman does not belong on death row.

176
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,870
She should be in the state asylum.

177
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:39,401
But if she wants to die,
who are we to stand in her way?

178
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:42,914
Governor, she is not fit
to make that decision.

179
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:46,349
She is certifiable and she is pregnant.

180
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:51,386
And if you execute her, you will be
committing murder. Two murders.

181
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,022
Transfer Bellinger.

182
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,659
And, Warden,
I want you to end this lockdown.

183
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,596
We don't have the situation under control.

184
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,100
It's Christmas.
I'm getting heat from the clergy...

185
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,502
including the Cardinal,
who will be at my party tonight.

186
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,732
Let the inmates out!

187
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:13,978
<i>And so in the spirit</i>
<i>of this blessed holiday season...</i>

188
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:17,982
<i>I commute Shirley Bellinger's sentence</i>
<i>to life imprisonment...</i>

189
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,711
<i>without the possibility of parole.</i>

190
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,855
<i>This action in no way affects my</i>
<i>long-standing support for the death penalty.</i>

191
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:32,659
- You betrayed me.
- I protected you and your baby.

192
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:35,701
I want an abortion,
and if you all won't give me one...

193
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:38,293
I will kill this monster inside me myself.

194
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:42,000
You're going to the Connelly Institute,
where you will be on 24-hour watch.

195
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,406
You're making a mistake!

196
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,710
Mark my words. Next year, this time,
you won't be celebrating Christmas.

197
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:53,241
You'll be bowing down before Satan.
The next millennium belongs to him.

198
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:57,520
Satan is the father
and I'm the virgin mother!

199
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,325
There's only one thing
that's gonna make this all okay:

200
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:06,929
You dead.

201
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:20,405
- You're back.
- Yeah. So are you.

202
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,368
Feeling better?

203
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,578
I'm alive.

204
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,605
Thanks to you.

205
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:36,951
Keller...

206
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,392
I just asked McManus
to let you be my roommate again.

207
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,376
Oh, boy. Schillinger's home.

208
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,515
He's not such a bad guy, Diane.

209
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,186
What drugs are you on?

210
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,882
- He's a shit load better than them.
- Them, as in "niggers"?

211
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:16,686
Yeah.

212
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,322
- Diane, wanna go to lunch?
- Sure.

213
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:37,778
That's the thing about an accusation
like sexual harassment.

214
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,082
There's nothing I can do.
I can't prove it, I can't disprove it.

215
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:46,117
- It just hangs there in the air.
- Becomes its own reality.

216
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,678
Cream puff?

217
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:20,691
Howell.

218
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,260
Diane, don't!

219
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:26,429
Fucking bitch! Come on, you cunt!

220
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:29,633
Let's see about your problem! Come here!

221
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,997
Come on, you fucking bitch!

222
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:37,168
Come on, stop it!

223
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:40,077
- Tell me if this is too tight.
- Okay.

224
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,385
What the hell happened?

225
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,781
Howell and Diane got into a fight, over me.

226
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,018
Christ!

227
00:21:55,527 --> 00:22:00,055
Don't, okay, Leo? I don't want to hear
any of your sanctimonious bullshit.

228
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:04,091
I don't care what you want to hear.
It's time you started taking responsibility...

229
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,364
- for the shit storms you create.
- What?

230
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:09,669
That's all I do all day, every day,
is take responsibility, Leo.

231
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:14,577
For every fucking thing in Em City. All I've
ever looked to you for is a little support.

232
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:17,810
- I supported you.
- Yeah, like with the thing with Wangler?

233
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,874
- You took his side right away.
- I did not.

234
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:23,115
Yeah, you took his fucking side!
Like you always do.

235
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:28,125
Like you do with Hill, like you do with Said,
and even Clayton Hughes. All the brothers!

236
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,152
No matter which side of the law.

237
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,254
Are you saying I do that
'cause they're black?

238
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:35,357
Read the scorecard, pal,
and add it up for yourself!

239
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,561
- Fuck you, McManus!
- Yeah, fuck me!

240
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:40,104
Guys, everybody's listening.

241
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,415
Okay, you've healed sufficiently
for me to remove the bandages.

242
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,475
I want to remind you both
that there are gonna be some changes...

243
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,953
in your pigmentation,
but they're only temporary.

244
00:22:57,022 --> 00:23:01,425
Your skin should return to its normal
appearance in six months to a year. Okay?

245
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,456
Go ahead.

246
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:23,279
- Damn!
- I might be able to get a cab now.

247
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,821
- What's up? All right?
- What up, dog?

248
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,696
- Damn, look at y'all. Y'all fucked up.
- Yeah, can you believe this shit?

249
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:42,298
So what you doing out of Em City?

250
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:46,503
What the fuck we all doing
out of Em City, that's what I'm talking about.

251
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,904
It's only temporary. You know what I mean?

252
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,839
- Adebisi got a plan.
- Get the fuck out!

253
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,970
I'm telling you,
Adebisi gonna pay for what he did...

254
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,948
I'm with you. He gonna pay, but later.

255
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,517
Right now, y'all need to listen
and let me tell you what's what.

256
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:16,326
In England, the day after Christmas
is called Boxing Day.

257
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,702
I'm not exactly sure why. But in Oz...

258
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:23,505
every day is a boxing day of sorts.

259
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:35,644
I heard a rumor that Glynn's thinking about
canceling the championship boxing match.

260
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,689
Not canceling, postponing.

261
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,917
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

262
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:44,585
- Man, that sucks!
- Life's full of disappointments, O'Reily.

263
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,960
I think you would've grasped that by now.

264
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:00,906
<i>Bismillah</i>, I need to talk to your man.

265
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,115
You got two minutes.

266
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:12,055
Warden, people have been looking forward
to this final bout for months.

267
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,821
- Lf you postpone this, there will be unrest.
- I know.

268
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:19,863
But last week, we had a major confrontation
between the Muslims and the Aryans...

269
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,958
- which you were a part of.
- Schillinger attacked Said first.

270
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:26,562
I don't wanna get into who's responsible.
You're all fucking responsible.

271
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:29,607
Schillinger attacked Beecher, too,
and he's white.

272
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,109
You trying to tell me
it had nothing to do with race?

273
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:36,272
Nothing? No.
But there were other things at play.

274
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:39,909
This is just two fighters fighting.
Right, Hamid?

275
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:45,046
The best man should win.

276
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:51,757
All right. I'll let the bout take place.

277
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:55,332
- But without an audience.
- What?

278
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,426
Just the fighters, the sidemen,
the referee, and the judges.

279
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,997
- No way.
- Take it or leave it, gentlemen.

280
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:10,413
Khan! Check this.

281
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,575
Even though you beat me down,
we betting on you to win.

282
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,382
That's right, baby. Nothing can stop him.

283
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:20,289
Strike that pretty white boy's face.

284
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:22,817
Kick his black ass, Cyril.

285
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:26,228
He ain't gonna let us down.
He's the king. Show them.

286
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:34,095
He better win, O'Reily,
or you're up shit's creek with no paddle.

287
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,100
Hit that fucking bag, Cyril.

288
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,171
Harder, come on. Hit that fucking bag.

289
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,953
Officer Murphy.

290
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:03,097
I was wondering,
do you know where Ryan O'Reily is?

291
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,598
He's at the gym.

292
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:14,609
Funny how he always asks for permission
to go to gymnasium just before a fight.

293
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:19,510
Why's that funny?

294
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:21,384
Forgive me.

295
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,179
We Russians,
we are suspicious of everyone.

296
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:35,699
What're you doing?

297
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,037
- Fuck!
- Chloral hydrate?

298
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,402
Spiking Khan's spritzer with this shit?

299
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,040
You been doing this all along?

300
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,306
- Drugging whoever Cyril boxed?
- I had to make sure he didn't get hurt.

301
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:54,147
I had to show the rest in here
that the Irish still matter.

302
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:57,052
If the others find out about this,
there'll be a fucking riot.

303
00:27:57,122 --> 00:28:00,353
Who says they have to find out?
Maybe you never saw me...

304
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:03,292
- maybe you never even came in here.
- But I did.

305
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:08,555
You wave the flag of Ireland all you want,
me brother, but that fact does not change.

306
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,835
So what happens next?

307
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:17,131
The fight goes on, fair and square.

308
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:19,206
No drugs.

309
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:23,006
Cyril wins or loses by his own hands.

310
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:27,785
This I'm gonna keep a secret.

311
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:31,414
But if I find out you fucked with Khan,
you're going to solitary.

312
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,926
- How the fuck is Cyril gonna beat Khan?
- That's not my problem.

313
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,392
Come on, let's go.

314
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,859
- How're you doing, bro?
- I feel good, Ryan.

315
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,139
- I feel good.
- All right.

316
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:52,004
Those other guys you fought...

317
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,841
they were kind of pussies, you know?

318
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,538
- Pussies?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:01,982
But this Khan kid's... He's tough.

320
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:06,085
- I'm tough.
- Yeah, I know you are.

321
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,656
You're gonna have to be extra special tough
when you fight him tomorrow.

322
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,097
Cyril, I got a surprise for you.

323
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,864
- A surprise?
- Yeah.

324
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,307
Dad's coming to visit.

325
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:31,713
Goddamn it.

326
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:34,916
Fucking piece of shit.

327
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:38,020
This goddamned thing just ate my quarters.

328
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:45,458
I'm here.

329
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:47,763
What's so fucking urgent?

330
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:52,429
You told your Aunt Brenda it was life
and death. I don't see anybody bleeding.

331
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:56,329
It's been a long time, Dad.
I've been in Oz for over three years.

332
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:59,172
- You've never come to see me.
- What's to see?

333
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:01,940
I've been inside, I know what it's like.

334
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:07,549
Even so, after Cyril got thrown in
you could've come.

335
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,554
What good's me being here
gonna do any of us?

336
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:16,318
- I'm boxing.
- What? Talk English.

337
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:24,593
- Why are you laughing?
- Who's he boxing, another retard?

338
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,235
- No, he's in the finals to be the champion.
- Jesus.

339
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:33,501
I thought Oz had balls. If a stooge like you
can be a champion, Christ!

340
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:36,642
Why do you always got to shit on
everything that we do?

341
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:40,708
- Maybe because everything you do is shit.
- Look who taught us.

342
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:45,688
Don't start with that.
I provided a good life for you.

343
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:48,692
I gave you a good home,
and you fucked it up!

344
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,825
Couple of two-bit wiseass punks...

345
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:53,729
drinking and whoring
just like that bitch, your mother.

346
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,993
- Shut up.
- Fuck you.

347
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:58,365
Shut up!

348
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,856
Thanks, Dad.
Came through for me just like always.

349
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:38,934
Be smart. Come on.

350
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,880
That's it, stick the jab!

351
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:45,883
- Cover up, Cyril.
- Finish him off!

352
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,350
That jab, Hamid.

353
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:51,678
One, two, three...

354
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:56,357
- four, five, six, seven.
- He's all right, come on.

355
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:58,293
- All right, breathe.
- Come on, Cyril.

356
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,797
Come on, take a breath. Let's go.

357
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,330
Let's go, baby, keep it up.

358
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:05,201
Keep your hands up.

359
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:08,804
Keep working the body.

360
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,474
...three, four...
- Breathe.

361
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:17,208
...five, six, seven, eight.
- Slowly. Take your time. He's all right.

362
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,881
Let him fight.

363
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:22,078
- Defense.
- Come on, let's go.

364
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:30,789
Stay on him! Keep on him! That's it.

365
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,298
- Sit down.
- I wanna stop.

366
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,098
There's no way you're fucking stopping.

367
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,764
This is nothing. Stay to the body.
Come with to head...

368
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,933
- I want to stop.
- No, you're not stopping.

369
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,910
Don't think of him as Khan, all right?

370
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,845
Look at me. Think of him as Dad.

371
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,176
This guy's got nothing.

372
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,918
- Dad?
- Yeah, Dad. All right?

373
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:59,087
Be serious, okay? You got it?
Be thinking of Dad right there.

374
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:01,387
- Now get out there.
- Second bell.

375
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:02,983
You got it. Let's go.

376
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,364
Round two, gentlemen.

377
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:08,456
Come on. Get him, baby.

378
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:11,862
Be careful.

379
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:14,027
Dad!

380
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:26,011
- Hamid, watch him.
- Come on, Cyril, Dad!

381
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:28,809
Come on, Cyril.

382
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:31,744
Shit!

383
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:34,086
That's it. Stay on him!

384
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:35,717
Look what you did.

385
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,465
- Clinch!
- Come on!

386
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:51,365
Come on, now.

387
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:23,773
You did it! You fucking did it!
Come here, baby. Come on.

388
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,969
I'm the champion!

389
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:30,174
There's something's wrong with his leg!
He's not moving! Get somebody!

390
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,214
Get someone!

391
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:35,181
Khan, can you hear me?

392
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:40,349
Come on, Hamid. Get somebody!
Khan, can you hear me? Come on.

393
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,989
- Khan, can you hear me?
- What happened?

394
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,189
Get back.

395
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:47,828
Get a doc!

396
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:58,535
- I hurt that man.
- No, he'll be fine.

397
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:00,368
No.

398
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:02,970
I hurt him bad.

399
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,318
Why, Ryan? Why'd you make me hurt him?

400
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:11,948
Just get ready to go to bed, please, Cyril.
Come on.

401
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,717
Tell me. Why'd I have to hurt him?

402
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:20,292
Would you just shut up, please,
and get ready for bed? I'm tired.

403
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:23,027
No, you answer me now.

404
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:26,900
Why'd you make me think of Dad?

405
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:31,200
And Mom? Why?

406
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:33,099
To survive.

407
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,207
Don't you fucking get it yet?

408
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:38,878
To survive in this fucking hellhole.

409
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,655
You want the goddamn truth?

410
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:53,293
Khan is brain-damaged.

411
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,567
- No.
- Yeah.

412
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:03,138
I saw it when he went down.
His eyes went all vacant and shit.

413
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:11,444
You mean I made him just like me?

414
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:14,340
No.

415
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:18,115
Worse.

416
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,929
No! Cyril, no!

417
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:10,772
Is there any chance
of my husband coming out of this?

418
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:16,572
We had a specialist from Benchley Memorial
verify Dr. Nathan's diagnosis.

419
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:20,240
He agreed Hamid is irreversibly brain dead.

420
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,811
He's on life support now.

421
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,618
My husband wouldn't want
to be kept alive by a machine.

422
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:42,134
- Please take him off life support.
- Unfortunately, we can't do that.

423
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:46,010
State law requires us to maintain treatment.

424
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,505
But I'm his wife.

425
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,009
Ma'am, in this particular case,
because he's a prisoner...

426
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:57,246
your wishes, his wishes...

427
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,421
would not be taken into consideration.

428
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:04,194
You're the one who molested
a young black inmate, aren't you?

429
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,594
I've been accused. It's not true.

430
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:13,400
I find it unseemly...

431
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:17,639
to talk about my husband's life
with him present.

432
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,404
- Mrs. Khan...
- It's all right.

433
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:27,208
I'll go. Again, I'm very sorry
about what's happened.

434
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:30,787
You're gonna be more than sorry, sir.

435
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,955
I intend to sue this prison.

436
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:44,031
First, to get Hamid off life support,
and second, for negligence.

437
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:47,529
For allowing this boxing match
to happen at all.

438
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:52,240
Mrs. Khan, your husband knew the risk.

439
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,441
He agreed voluntarily.
He pushed for the fight.

440
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:58,346
So you say.

441
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:02,209
We'll let a jury decide what's true.

442
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:44,227
Everybody's worried about
this Y2K problem.

443
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:47,993
Come 2000, the computers are gonna have
a nervous breakdown.

444
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:51,331
Planes will fall from the sky,
the water supply will dry up...

445
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:55,168
and the Pentagon will start
shooting nuclear warheads at Canada.

446
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,073
Some predict that prison doors
will automatically spring open.

447
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,945
But I got the solution:

448
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,578
A do-over.

449
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,451
At the stroke of midnight, it's 1900 again...

450
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,885
and we get to do
the whole fucking century over.

451
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:15,392
I mean, let's face it. We didn't do
such a hot job the first time around.

452
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,057
New Year's Eve.

453
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,996
Can you smell that?

454
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,170
What?

455
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,268
Hatred.

456
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:35,669
There's hatred in the air.

457
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:40,841
- It's just an ordinary day in Oz.
- No, my friend, this is much worse.

458
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:42,641
Look.

459
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:45,886
Adebisi sitting with Arif.

460
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:51,988
And all those white faces...

461
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,726
just clumped together.

462
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:04,033
I'm very afraid of what might happen.

463
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,910
Then do something about it.

464
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,139
I can't.

465
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:20,085
Three years ago, I made the riot happen...

466
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:22,889
and all those deaths.

467
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:27,823
I accept my guilt in that. Now, finally.

468
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:31,997
But this...

469
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:37,002
I don't want any part of this.

470
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:45,514
You fucked up Khan. We gonna fuck you up.

471
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:48,211
Back off, bitch. That was a fucking accident.

472
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:52,586
- Back the fuck up and get out of my face.
- Feeling tall, little man? Bring it on.

473
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:55,385
Fucking cock, get the fuck out of here.

474
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:03,194
My father was also killed in this room.

475
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:08,236
- Keep moving.
- Last year, I found my guide. He found me.

476
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,199
Taught me my life, my soul, my heritage.

477
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:15,006
And just like your father,
they cut him down like an animal.

478
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:20,111
- Right over there, Jara died.
- Walk away, Adebisi.

479
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:22,414
Yes, be angry. Be angry!

480
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,881
'Cause these things are no coincidence.
The waters run deep.

481
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,628
- I know who killed your father.
- What?

482
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:36,293
You send Mukada to find answers.
You get what they want you to hear.

483
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,269
- I got my answers from Glynn.
- I ask around. I get truth.

484
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:45,498
- Which is?
- Whose prints were on the shank?

485
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,884
You have to wise up, my brother...

486
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:01,650
because they want you, too.

487
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,363
I'll watch yours...

488
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:15,934
and you watch mine.

489
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,169
Adebisi, move your ass!

490
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,481
Man, I wish I'd been there
to see fucking Khan go down.

491
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:38,221
Yeah, maybe Allah was out of town.

492
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:42,157
I told you,
the best boxers aren't always Negro.

493
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:48,127
Fuck you both.

494
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:59,476
I'm concerned about the agitation
that's out there since Khan got flattened.

495
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,816
I know what you mean, man. I hear
a lot of shit coming out of your mouth.

496
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:04,912
It's not shit.

497
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,958
I ain't saying you <i>cocolos</i>
haven't been fucked all your life.

498
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:09,492
I have been, too.

499
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,257
But all these noises you're making
will fuck things up around here.

500
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:17,097
You can't move tits
if you're in lockdown 24<i>l</i>7.

501
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:21,295
There are some things
more important than tits.

502
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:24,431
More important than money.

503
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:30,704
More important than money?

504
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:34,182
He's in his <i>loco</i> mode again, man.

505
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,762
What do you want?

506
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:53,867
The niggers are up to something.

507
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:57,403
The "niggers" are always up to something.
So are you.

508
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:01,400
I know there's been a lot of shit
between us all over the years...

509
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:04,573
but we gotta put that aside. At least for now.

510
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:09,183
We gotta be bound by the one thing
that joins us all together:

511
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:10,845
The color of our skin.

512
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:14,023
I am not gonna listen to this shit.

513
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:17,618
- Come on, Chris.
- Wait. I wanna hear what he has to say.

514
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:22,691
I'm Russian, and I'm a Jew.
But I'm also white.

515
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:27,563
So Schillinger, do you accept me
as a part of your group?

516
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:34,407
- Yes.
- Fuck.

517
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:41,776
Hold on, man. Here.

518
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:47,786
What's up with you?

519
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:51,760
First you're all buddies with Adebisi
and now you're being nice to me?

520
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:54,627
You've been wanting to stick me
since Coyle got killed.

521
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:58,532
Coyle is history, you know what I'm saying?
I'm living in the right now.

522
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:02,638
And what now is telling me,
is if we don't get together...

523
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,442
we gonna die apart.

524
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:09,772
All is going well.

525
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,969
Things are bad.

526
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:12,174
So what do we do next?

527
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:13,238
So what do we do?

528
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:14,341
We wait.

529
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,476
We act first.

530
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,615
An opportunity will arise.

531
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:21,122
The first opportunity, we let everyone know
that we're still in charge.

532
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:22,382
Are you sure?

533
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,484
I don't know.

534
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:24,550
Yes.

535
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:25,617
Trust me.

536
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:45,012
Would you tell those jerk-offs in the
mail room not to go through my magazine?

537
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:47,915
Part of the job.
We inspect everything that comes into Oz.

538
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:51,716
Inspect is one thing. Beating off is another.
I paid top dollar for <i>Hustler</i>.

539
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,316
- I don't want my pages all stuck together.
- Keep moving.

540
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:02,059
Line up!

541
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:05,732
What's he doing now?

542
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:14,109
It's the holiday season, so I try to be nice.
What do I get?

543
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,706
Place turns into a shithole.

544
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:23,010
Garbage everywhere, unmade beds,
turds in the toilet.

545
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:28,157
No more. No fucking more.

546
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:32,019
You clowns know the rules.

547
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:35,556
Emerald City is supposed to be spotless.

548
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:40,335
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

549
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:45,508
And so until this place
is up to my standards...

550
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:49,677
I'm gonna have to clear your minds
of the clutter.

551
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,272
I'm confiscating all skin magazines.

552
00:47:55,786 --> 00:48:00,519
Gentlemen, you got a choice.
You can either clean up your act...

553
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:03,082
or you can kiss the girls goodbye.

554
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,560
Not that one, man.

555
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:17,907
This is what I'm talking about.

556
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,504
- What they do to us.
- Adebisi, what you after, man?

557
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:27,280
You want another riot?
All it's gonna do is get more brothers killed.

558
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,181
- We are the majority.
- Yeah, but we don't have guns.

559
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:38,819
Some who wear uniform are still
our brothers, and may be willing to help.

560
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:43,289
I'm gonna say this now. You fucking crazy.

561
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,107
You're either one of us...

562
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,370
or one of them.

563
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,024
Did it work?

564
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,566
I think, yes.

565
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,470
What you got there, Hill?
You want a trip to the hole?

566
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:31,070
I want a little fucking skin.

567
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,675
Bad enough the Governor got rid
of conjugals, and now this. It's shit.

568
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:37,448
- You are shit!
- All right, that's it, the hole.

569
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:49,866
Again and again and again!

570
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:53,732
First it's Wangler, then Khan, and now Hill.

571
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:56,600
How many more of you before you wake up?

572
00:49:56,674 --> 00:49:59,666
We must not let this brutality
go unchallenged.

573
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:01,210
The Qur'an tells us so.

574
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:05,180
"Permission is given to those who fight
because they have been wronged.

575
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:08,047
"And indeed,
God is able to give them victory."

576
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:10,712
Why don't you finish the quote, Arif?

577
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:13,922
The Qur'an is a book of love, not hate.

578
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:17,287
It speaks to what is good in all of us.

579
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,496
Allah knows no color.

580
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:22,891
You are using the words
for your own needs.

581
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:26,367
My needs? I suppose I made up racism?

582
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:29,463
Arif, I lived on the same streets you did.

583
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:31,835
I know what prejudice tastes like.

584
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:35,606
I know what it is to walk into a room
and be the only black man.

585
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,208
Yes, we must right the wrongs
that have been done to us...

586
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:41,774
- but not this way, my brother.
- Then how?

587
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:43,979
We try and understand them.

588
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:57,500
No white man can truly understand
what it is to be black.

589
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,337
Nor us, them.

590
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,399
The Qur'an says...

591
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:09,936
I don't give a shit what your Qur'an says.

592
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:14,546
What exactly
do you give a shit about, Adebisi?

593
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:22,121
Justice. Just like you.

594
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:26,318
Set Hill free!

595
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,906
- Set Hill free!
- Shut the fuck up!

596
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:07,934
The SORT team is in full readiness.

597
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:12,701
I've decided to keep the entire prison
in lockdown for the immediate future.

598
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:17,646
I ask you to be careful
and be ready for any possibilities.

599
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:19,880
That's all.

600
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:25,812
- I can't go through this shit again.
- It's going to be all right.

601
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:30,292
No, I'm gonna take my vacation time.
If they don't let me do that, I'm gonna quit.

602
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:33,985
- Diane...
- No, I'm serious. I will quit.

603
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:38,627
- You afraid, Murph?
- Yeah, sure.

604
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:39,963
Yeah, me, too.

605
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:43,173
- Leo.
- Yeah.

606
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:50,837
- We can't hide behind the badge anymore.
- What do you mean?

607
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:54,315
All these years you've been in the system...

608
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:58,013
all these years you've worked for them,
caging in your own kind...

609
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:01,754
don't you ever feel sometimes
like you've betrayed your own people?

610
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,656
- No.
- No?

611
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:11,401
The men who are locked in here,
they're not my people.

612
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:15,805
My people are the ones who obey the law.

613
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:21,607
Go home, Clayton. You're fired.

614
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:36,925
Lots of folks think the world's gonna end,
come the dawn of this new millennium.

615
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,585
They think we'll see
the Second Coming of Christ...

616
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:42,564
the Apocalypse, Armageddon, Doomsday.

617
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,227
They tie it all to God's great plan.

618
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:48,805
But ask yourself,
"Does God know it's January 1?"

619
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:53,769
Does he have his watch set for midnight?
And if he does, which time zone is he in?

620
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:58,276
Man invented hours, days, and minutes.

621
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:00,942
Man invented calendars and clocks.

622
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:05,248
God's got his own timetable and it's stupid
of us to think that we can set it for him.

623
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:09,952
All we can do is watch the clock run out,
and hope for the best.

624
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:17,323
Happy New Year.

625
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:21,229
Yeah.

626
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,038
Happy New Year.

627
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,174
Happy New Year.

628
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:47,156
- Happy New Year, motherfucker!
- Eat me, you little prick.

629
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:00,810
Happy New Year, little brother.

630
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,469
A bunch of men sit in cells
on the brink of a new year...

631
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:44,570
a new century, a new millennium...

632
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:47,014
1,000 years.

633
00:56:48,418 --> 00:56:51,512
They stare into the future and all they see...

634
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:55,190
is themselves in those same cells.

635
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:01,955
Black or white, here we are on the precipice.

636
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,529
We either hang on or we fall off.

637
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,768
Together or separately.

638
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:12,334
It's our choice. It's up to us.

639
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,810
It's up to you and me.

640
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:21,181
<i>Happy New Year!</i>
