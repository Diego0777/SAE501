1
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,009
Life in Oz sucks, and only a fool
or a Republican will tell you different.

2
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,724
But the punishments here are nowhere near
as fucked up as in the olden days.

3
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,756
Example, the guy who drank too much.

4
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:01,395
The constable would make him wear
a drunkard's cloak...

5
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,529
which was a whiskey barrel with holes
for the head, the arms, and the legs!

6
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,434
<i>Then they'd make the drunk</i>
<i>walk around the town square...</i>

7
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,067
<i>where everyone would call him names.</i>

8
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:14,671
Yo, retard! You're next.

9
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,151
Keep punching. Fuck him.
Let's go. Punch it.

10
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,116
Ribs, head. Come on, fuck him.

11
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,295
Pancamo's tough, man.

12
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:38,168
He's got heavy hands, a good chin,
and he's a mean son of a bitch.

13
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:41,165
The only advantage your brother has
is speed.

14
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,906
- You don't seem too worried.
- I got faith.

15
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:53,751
Faith's a good thing.
But I'd put my money on Pancamo.

16
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:02,588
- Cudney.
- What do you want?

17
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,789
- You working bedpan duty today?
- Yeah.

18
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,959
Great. I need you to steal me
some more of that chloral hydrate...

19
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:10,901
- and then put it right in here.
- No.

20
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,507
We had a deal, remember?
You sneak drugs out of the hospital...

21
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:19,943
- I give you nice green fed notes.
- Stealing is wrong.

22
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:25,041
Today, I confessed to the Lord in front of
my brothers and promised to sin no more.

23
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,821
Fine. You're not the only fish
in the Sea of Galilee.

24
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,619
I figured out what you were doing
with the chloral hydrate.

25
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,751
You spike the fighter's spritzers,
so they're drugged in the ring.

26
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:36,261
That's crazy talk.

27
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,298
I've made an appointment with the warden
to tell him.

28
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:43,230
My soul is in jeopardy. So's yours.

29
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,201
By turning you in, I'm gonna save you.

30
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,539
Not if I save you first.

31
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,092
I don't got a lot of time.

32
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:12,359
Rumor is you're the most ruthless hitman
in Little Odessa. That's got to mean a lot...

33
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,629
because you Russian mob guys
are crazy fucked-up motherfuckers.

34
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:20,196
I need a job done, I need it done pronto.
Just tell me when to stop, okay?

35
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,973
97B752.

36
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,742
98B526.

37
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:28,410
99B131.

38
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,147
99C124.

39
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:37,515
99C124!

40
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:39,919
Cudney!

41
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,930
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

42
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,034
Cudney, get out here!

43
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,810
Shit, look at the blood.

44
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,980
- He's dead.
- Look at these two small holes.

45
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:08,785
Stabbed in the neck.

46
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:23,686
In this corner,
Chucky "The Enforcer" Pancamo.

47
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,497
Put this on.

48
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,870
Let them fight!

49
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,612
Come on, tough guy.

50
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,146
Fight!

51
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:14,112
He doesn't want to fight.

52
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,075
Come on, Cyril.

53
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,414
Let's go, come on. Use your head.

54
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,081
What the fuck is that?

55
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,021
Don't worry about that fucking fat
dago motherfucker. He's all yours.

56
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:07,858
You okay? You feel good?

57
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,675
What did I tell you?
You gotta believe in yourself.

58
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:38,479
When you focus, when you put your mind
to it, you can do really big things, Cyril.

59
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:47,325
Here's the money I owe you
for betting on Pancamo.

60
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,295
- Good fight.
- Thanks.

61
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,499
Cyril, would you mind if I talked to
your brother alone for just a moment?

62
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:00,069
Go downstairs.
It's almost time for <i>Miss Sally</i>.

63
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,266
- Close the door, please.
- Sure.

64
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,212
What's up?

65
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:13,182
I understand Yuri Kosygin
did a little job for you.

66
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:17,344
- Job?
- Kosygin is a dangerous man.

67
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,716
Unpredictable, unreliable.

68
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:26,226
He's making sounds like he's going to tell
the authorities about killing Cudney.

69
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,926
He killed Cudney?

70
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,836
Ryan, I'm here as your friend.

71
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:37,572
I'm telling you, Kosygin must be eliminated.

72
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:42,337
You know, we got a little saying in
this country. Maybe you've heard it:

73
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,406
"You can't shit a shitter."

74
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,854
You want Kosygin dead. You come here,
you say he's making sounds.

75
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,718
You're hoping that I'm gonna
take care of it for you. No chance.

76
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,786
I do like you, O'Reily.

77
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,628
Then like this:
Here's some free advice for you.

78
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,794
You want Yuri's balls?
Have the Sicilians do it.

79
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,402
Sicilians?

80
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,641
- May I approach?
- Sure, approach.

81
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:24,821
Recently, you and I had a conversation
about Yuri Kosygin.

82
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,922
He's very disrespectful.

83
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:29,989
He is also...

84
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,064
I bet on you.

85
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,736
I lost very heavy. He won very heavy.

86
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,733
He told me
he spiked your water with heroin...

87
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,338
in order to, how do you say...

88
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,576
fuck you up.

89
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,278
I knew it! Goddamn, I fucking knew it!

90
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:58,153
- I hope you don't mind me telling you this.
- No, I don't mind. I appreciate it.

91
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,058
In fact, I owe you one.

92
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,893
- We gotta do the fight over.
- Bullshit.

93
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,333
- I was drugged out.
- What's your proof?

94
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:11,461
Have me tested.

95
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:14,097
I'm not gonna spend time or money
to have you tested...

96
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,971
just because you're a sore loser.
Now get the fuck out!

97
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,975
Come on, you heard the man. Let's go.

98
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:29,018
- Dumb move, man.
- What?

99
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,086
Letting the hacks know
you know Kosygin did the dirty.

100
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:36,060
- Lf Kosygin dies, they're gonna blame you.
- That's right.

101
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,894
I know you're pissed off
that my brother won the fight, all right?

102
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:45,495
But in the name of good sportsmanship,
I got a small suggestion for you.

103
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:46,595
What's that?

104
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,799
The next best thing
to having someone killed...

105
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:53,471
is having them sent to solitary for the rest
of their lives. Or better yet, death row.

106
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:59,280
When Kosygin finds out that Stanislofsky
snitched on him, your problems are solved.

107
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:05,488
In the 1600s, snitches and gossips were
made to wear something called a brank...

108
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:10,358
which was an iron helmet that was placed
on the head, enclosing it in a kind of cage.

109
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,057
There was a front plate
covered with spikes...

110
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:20,038
which was placed inside the mouth,
so that if you tried to talk...

111
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:23,538
You get the idea.
You learn to keep your mouth shut.

112
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,847
You're in America now, Nikolai.

113
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:42,521
- Let's speak American.
- All right. We speak English.

114
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,891
Unlike you, in Russia I was not a criminal.

115
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,164
I was an educator.

116
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:03,212
After the Soviets fell,
things got so bleak in Moscow...

117
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:05,978
I decided to leave, to come to America.

118
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,255
For a better life, right?

119
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:12,291
Yes, for me and my wife.

120
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,492
But we did not find a better life.

121
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,627
I couldn't get employed teaching.

122
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,562
Must have been terrible.

123
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:31,042
Then I got this job painting a house,
the house of Leonid Rodzinsky.

124
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,678
- He was in the Organizatsya.
- Yes.

125
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,614
He treated me like shit, always making fun.

126
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:43,416
Calling me "professor"
and ordering me to clean his toilets.

127
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,950
One day, he kicked me with his boot
in front of my wife.

128
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,456
I strangled him on the spot.

129
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:05,106
- It's closing time?
- Yes.

130
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,374
All right, I'll go.

131
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,973
Not till I finish my story.

132
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,574
Strange. All this time,
you've barely said two words.

133
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:17,487
- Now you're a regular <i>bottum</i>.
- It takes me time to warm up to people.

134
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,351
I feel very close to you.

135
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,831
I was possessed by guilt
for killing Rodzinsky...

136
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,327
but I got a reputation for being ruthless.

137
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,773
The Organizatsya hired me
to exterminate someone else.

138
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,973
- The second time was easy...
- Yuri, please.

139
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:42,508
I don't want to hear this.

140
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,873
The third time, no problem at all.

141
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,444
- Yuri, please.
- At last count, I murdered at least 49 people.

142
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:53,354
- You have the honor of being my 50th.
- No!

143
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,455
No, you wait now!

144
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,558
Guards!

145
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:21,419
I need to get his record
to find out what his blood type is.

146
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:25,787
Let's start an IV, get me a suture set,
and let's give him Demerol, 50 milligrams.

147
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,621
- I need you to stay still.
- No, please.

148
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,766
No hard feelings?

149
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:44,898
About?

150
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:56,486
- Nooter's a fag.
- What makes you say that?

151
00:17:56,555 --> 00:18:00,514
- Look at how he's always grabbing Pecky.
- They're fighting.

152
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:03,727
All I'm saying is
it's a lot of body contact, man.

153
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,894
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard of, a gay puppet.

154
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,197
- One of the Teletubbies is gay.
- What?

155
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,603
Falwell, the Reverend somebody, says that
Twinky Dink, or whatever his name is...

156
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,539
is a butt pirate.

157
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,442
That's nuts!

158
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,842
You gotta have a cock to be gay.

159
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:27,752
Teletubbies don't have cocks.
The puppet doesn't have a cock.

160
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:30,814
Where's it say you gotta have a cock
to be gay?

161
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,256
All you need is a mouth,
so you can suck cock.

162
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,599
- Hernandez wants to see you.
- Right.

163
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:52,076
Alvarez, what am I always saying
about our friend O'Reily here?

164
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:56,343
- That he's no dummy.
- That's right, he's no dummy.

165
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,283
- Feeling's mutual, Raoul.
- That so?

166
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,022
Then how come you're always acting
like I'm an idiot?

167
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,755
You know Adebisi and me
are working with the Sicilians now.

168
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:10,557
We're running the tits everywhere in Oz.

169
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:13,530
Yeah, I know.

170
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,624
But you sell on your own.
What's up with that?

171
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:18,329
Me? No, man. A little, sure.

172
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,339
But there's no way I compete with you guys.

173
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:24,035
Man, I don't care. I want you to stop.

174
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:33,247
Have you talked this over
with Adebisi and Pancamo?

175
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,219
My word ain't good enough, man?

176
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,851
No, man, your word is plenty good.
I'll stop, right away. <i>Finito</i>.

177
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:47,898
- Give us what you got.
- Now?

178
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:53,661
- Can I keep a little for my own personal use?
- You don't use no more, man.

179
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,612
Bullshit.

180
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,878
- Assume the position.
- What?

181
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,830
- I completely forgot about that one.
- No shit.

182
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:30,875
- No more, O'Reily. <i>Comprende</i>?
- Yeah, <i>comprende</i>.

183
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:38,079
You wanna bust Hernandez? Now's the time.

184
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:48,756
Hernandez, turn around.

185
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:53,993
Empty your pockets.

186
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,469
Thank you. Cuff him.

187
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:03,340
- Take it fucking easy, man. Shit!
- Come on, let's go.

188
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:08,110
That there's a real heartbreaker, Alvarez.

189
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,047
I've been thinking.

190
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:27,494
I wanna see what I'd done to Rivera.

191
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,128
You will, when you see him face to face.

192
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:34,297
When I stabbed him, I walked away.

193
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,640
I didn't look at him in the eyes.

194
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,643
I wanna see what I did that day.

195
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:46,207
I wanna see what it looked like that day.

196
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:49,479
You mean like a photograph?

197
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:54,518
I used to work in the hospital
and they used to take photographs...

198
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:57,819
of all the prisoners that came in
with serious shit...

199
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:00,524
just for the courts, and whatever.

200
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:06,638
I wanna see a picture of Rivera.

201
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:13,577
Miguel, I don't know if that's a good idea.

202
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,072
You asked me what happened,
and I couldn't tell you...

203
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,916
because everything
was just a blur, you know...

204
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,852
and it was all shouting.

205
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,986
Every fucking day that I get up,
I look in the mirror...

206
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,826
and I don't see me.

207
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:37,529
You know, I don't see me.

208
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:41,533
I just see this other guy who did this.

209
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:44,974
And a photograph will do what?

210
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,073
I don't know.

211
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,646
Just make me forget about that other guy.

212
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,679
Just let me...

213
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,851
be alone with myself again.

214
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,401
I'll see what I can do.

215
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,966
There you are.

216
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,236
- Tina, what's the matter?
- You gotta stop this.

217
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,801
- You gotta stop Eugene from coming here.
- What's wrong?

218
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:23,848
It's like I said,
bringing up all this shit from the past.

219
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,181
- It's made him crazy.
- Okay, let's go to my office.

220
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,751
He's not acting normal anymore.

221
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:35,057
I'm really surprised to hear you say that.

222
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:39,928
Because when Eugene is with me,
he seems very calm.

223
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:43,024
He seems open and ready to face Alvarez.

224
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,935
No! It's an act, I tell you.

225
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:49,301
At home, he says nothing.

226
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:52,037
He just sits there all quiet.

227
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:58,747
Are you sure it's he who's not talking?

228
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,123
Maybe he's afraid that since you didn't
want him to be in the program...

229
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:08,022
you might not be supportive.

230
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:12,695
Don't tell me I'm not supportive.
I have been there for him.

231
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:16,701
Through the surgeries,
by his bed, day and night.

232
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,531
I rearranged the house,
my whole fucking life!

233
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,038
I know what you've done.

234
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:24,633
Eugene told me he could have
never made it this far without you.

235
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:28,976
He also told me
he's thinking of committing suicide.

236
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:34,409
- What?
- So that you can have a life.

237
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,725
Sweet Jesus!

238
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:53,063
Years ago, I was married,
and my husband was murdered.

239
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,100
So for a very long time...

240
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:58,973
I wallowed in grief and anger...

241
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:01,012
until that's all I had.

242
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,412
Eugene knows
that he only has two choices now:

243
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:09,914
To move on or die.

244
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:17,024
You've helped him this far.
Go the rest of the way.

245
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:05,877
We take Ponoma down to the piers.
He knows what's up.

246
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:10,005
He don't beg, he don't struggle.
I tell him, I say, "Sonny...

247
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:13,910
"you got a pair of balls."
And then I blew them both off.

248
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,089
- Who the fuck are you?
- Nat Ginsberg. Your new roommate.

249
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:23,052
Okay, new roomie,
you listen up and listen good.

250
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:27,631
- This is my cell. You just sleep here.
- Got a name, tough guy?

251
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,530
Nappa. Mr. Nappa.

252
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,965
- I love to eat Italian.
- I ain't no fag.

253
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,939
Don't worry. I won't hold that against you.

254
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:41,310
- You a writer?
- I'm doing my memoirs.

255
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:44,071
Are you Antonio Nappa? The mob guy?

256
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:48,785
That's gonna be some book.
You naming names?

257
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,320
Names, places, felonies.

258
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:55,221
You don't, by any chance,
need a Boswell, do you?

259
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,256
Secretary.

260
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,665
Sure. What's your name again?

261
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,662
Nat.

262
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:08,205
Short for Nathaniel?

263
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,201
Short for Natalie.

264
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:22,785
What do you got for me?

265
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:26,824
Yeah, he's writing some fucking book
about his life.

266
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,724
And from what I hear, he tells everything.

267
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:46,305
He wants to get the book.
We take care of Nappa.

268
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:49,810
- Fuck.
- Yeah, fuck.

269
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,009
Why don't you just kill me?

270
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:29,954
Kenny...

271
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,025
You know, in Africa...

272
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,261
the elders of the tribe...

273
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:44,393
used to teach the young warriors
not just how to fight...

274
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,562
but how to live.

275
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:54,905
I am the chief of this tribe.

276
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,581
I'm gonna teach you
the right way to behave.

277
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,919
You're a sick motherfucker, Adebisi.
Oh, shit!

278
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:11,291
First lesson is in respect.

279
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,158
God, I do respect you. I respect you.

280
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,572
Yeah? Get ready.

281
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,202
We have to prepare breakfast
for our brothers.

282
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:42,659
Your wife is murdered.
You find out she's been cheating on you.

283
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,391
That's a lot to handle emotionally.

284
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:49,193
We grew up in the same 'hood...

285
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,065
went to the same grade school,
same junior high together.

286
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:56,399
I was supposed to take her to her prom
but I got arrested the day before.

287
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:59,069
I had the tux rented, corsage bought.

288
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:03,247
I feel bad that she missed out 'cause of me.

289
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,477
There's something else
that we're gonna have to deal with:

290
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:08,814
Your son.

291
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,821
Now that he has no mother,
he's gonna depend on you.

292
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:15,724
He's gonna need more from you as a father.

293
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,959
What you saying? I love my kid.

294
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:23,595
Sure. But the time that you spend with him
needs to be more focused.

295
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:26,167
I want you to join the parenting program.

296
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,534
Establish an ongoing relationship
with your son...

297
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:31,508
so that when you get released,
he'll know who you are.

298
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:34,010
What do you say? Will you join up?

299
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:38,610
I guess. Anything for my kid.

300
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,635
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, how you doing?

301
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:04,232
- Hi.
- Hi, it's your daddy.

302
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:07,540
Jordan, come here.

303
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,744
What's up? How you been?
You been with Grandma?

304
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,984
Why he act like he don't know me?

305
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,187
- He hasn't seen you for a while.
- Take your time.

306
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:30,128
Jordan, how's your Grandma treating you?

307
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:33,968
Stop, don't cry. Stop crying!

308
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,065
No, stop crying. Be a man!

309
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,542
It's okay.

310
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:48,113
Honey, it's all right. It's okay, sweetie.

311
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:55,392
- Where you going, Kenny?
- I got things to do.

312
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:05,935
McManus was just fucking with your head,
little brother.

313
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:08,802
The way all white men fuck with our heads.

314
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,043
But I got a plan, Kenny.

315
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,611
- A way to break McManus.
- What good is that gonna do?

316
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:21,109
We force them to bring someone else
to run Emerald City.

317
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:24,620
- Who will be just as bad.
- Who will be one of us.

318
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:03,287
All right, SORT, we're gonna work
on cell extraction. Non-cooperative prisoner.

319
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:05,223
Get down!

320
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:08,187
Stay down!

321
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:24,541
...and the governor said
the crime rate is down...

322
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:27,107
because of longer prison sentences.

323
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:31,684
- You ever think about going SORT?
- They're not big on women.

324
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,451
Besides, when you sign on to SORT...

325
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,720
they remove
all the human parts of your body.

326
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:37,887
Don't you think
that's the way they gotta be?

327
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:40,760
We're supposed to have a
day-to-day relationship with the prisoners...

328
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:41,992
but the SORT guys...

329
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:44,535
their job is to go in
and shut an ugly situation down.

330
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:46,934
I know that, and I appreciate that.

331
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:50,537
But it takes a special kind of hardness
to be SORT.

332
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,840
And I don't have it?

333
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,452
We out of Sweet 'N Low?

334
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:11,161
You all deaf?

335
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,565
What you did to Tim McManus sucks.

336
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:19,135
What I did to Tim McManus
was suck his cock.

337
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,606
And for that, he treated me like a shitball.

338
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,642
Accusing him of sexual harassment?

339
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,643
That's an insult to women
who have been abused.

340
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:29,805
Like you?

341
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:32,009
Yeah, like me.

342
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:36,679
You know what your problem is, Diane?
You wanna be everybody's best pal.

343
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:42,053
And your problem?
You wanna be everybody's worst nightmare.

344
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:46,225
Look, Sweet 'N Low.

345
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,567
She's the right type for the SORT team.

346
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,515
O'Brien.

347
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:14,990
Bevilaqua.

348
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,724
Giles. Giles?

349
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:27,403
Phase 4, this is Radio 24 requesting backup.

350
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,706
Drawing and quartering.

351
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:34,874
A man was tied to the tail of a horse and
dragged along the ground to a gallows...

352
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:36,811
where he was hung till he was half dead.

353
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:39,941
Then, brought down, his body cut open...

354
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,418
his entrails taken out and burned...

355
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:46,048
then his head cut off,
and his body sliced into quarters.

356
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:50,385
After all that indignity, the hangman would
hold up the dead man's heart and yell:

357
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,862
"Behold! The heart of a traitor!"

358
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:02,266
- Leo.
- Yeah?

359
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,740
I just wanted to talk to you
about Clayton Hughes.

360
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:06,242
- Yeah?
- Well...

361
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:08,645
- What'd he do now?
- Nothing.

362
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,681
I just had a little conversation with him...

363
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:14,548
and he seems to need to know
if the guy who stabbed his dad is still in Oz.

364
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,444
I told him to let it go.
He's young, he won't listen.

365
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:19,217
I dug around the files a little.

366
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,090
There are 26 inmates who were here 17
years ago, who may have seen something.

367
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:26,722
- I wanted to tell you I'll talk to each of them.
- What good will that do?

368
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,358
We interrogated them all at the time.
We got nowhere.

369
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,902
I'm not telling you
that I'm gonna find anything out.

370
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,532
After all these years, maybe someone's
willing to give up some information.

371
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:44,977
- Hi, Glo.
- Hey.

372
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,813
I hear you have William Giles here.

373
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:51,322
Yeah, he suffered a mild heart attack.
So I have him under observation.

374
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:53,220
Is he still talking in Morse code?

375
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:56,091
He seems to do well
with yes-and-no questions.

376
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,184
- May I?
- Yeah.

377
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:58,456
Thanks.

378
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:20,681
William, remember me? Father Mukada.

379
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,814
How are you feeling? Better?

380
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:27,949
Yes.

381
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:31,623
I've been meaning
to come and see you in solitary.

382
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:34,494
Would you mind if I asked you a question?

383
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,857
No.

384
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,498
Do you remember 17 years ago,
a CO named Samuel Hughes?

385
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:45,800
Yes.

386
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,568
Do you remember
that he was killed here in Oz?

387
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:50,539
Yeah.

388
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,607
Were you there in the cafeteria
when he was killed?

389
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:56,077
Yes.

390
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,551
Do you know who killed him?

391
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,791
Do you know who killed Samuel Hughes?

392
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,663
Tell, bye-bye, die.

393
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,896
No, you won't. I swear.

394
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:19,200
You'll be back in solitary
where no inmate can hurt you.

395
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:21,969
No.

396
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:25,948
There's a young man,
Samuel Hughes' son, Clayton.

397
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,647
He needs to know
what happened to his father.

398
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,484
I've talked to all the other prisoners
who were here then...

399
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,649
and no one will tell me anything.

400
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:37,093
William, please.

401
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,590
Which prisoner killed Samuel Hughes?

402
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:53,705
- No. No prisoner.
- Not a prisoner?

403
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,309
Then who?

404
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:07,188
Leo Glynn.

405
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:25,434
This is Radio 320, we got a problem here.
Prisoner's OD'd.

406
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:28,812
We're too late for the medics.
Send the morgue boys.

407
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,404
- Morning, Glen.
- Yeah.

408
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:02,374
It's so nice and quiet.
I wish we could leave them like this.

409
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,478
Especially now since Schillinger's son OD'd.

410
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,246
Yeah, I heard.
I thought Andrew was in the hole.

411
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,378
- He was.
- So how did he get the drugs?

412
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:11,820
Beats the shit out of me.

413
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:14,790
- Is Glynn investigating?
- Yeah, but on the QT.

414
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:18,124
Doesn't seem all that anxious to find out.
See you tomorrow.

415
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,518
How you doing there, Vern?

416
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,495
I knew a guy who had one arm.

417
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:04,101
He told me when he dreams,
he still had both arms.

418
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,772
Every morning, he'd wake up...

419
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,779
and have to realize all over again,
one arm was missing.

420
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:21,157
Every morning, it was like the first time
they told him his arm was gone.

421
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:31,658
My son is dead.

422
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:36,736
What you did, giving him the heroin...

423
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:42,869
that was the right thing.

424
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:46,116
You put him to the test.

425
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:49,218
He was weak.

426
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,319
He was not one of us.

427
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:56,016
No.

428
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,889
The way I figure, it was euthanasia.

429
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,463
Keller and Beecher
were gonna fuck with my boy.

430
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,265
By killing him...

431
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:14,639
I saved him.

432
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:27,084
I'm asking McManus
to put me back in your pod.

433
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:29,185
Don't.

434
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:34,393
Why? Andy's dead.
He ain't coming back anytime soon.

435
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,638
You and me, Beecher.

436
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:49,443
Please take your hand away.

437
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,414
- Beecher.
- Please.

438
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,147
Take your fucking hand away.

439
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:01,416
What the fuck are you looking at?

440
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:07,527
You wanted revenge on Schillinger.
I helped you get that.

441
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,431
You did it for us?

442
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:13,535
Yeah.

443
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:16,467
When are you gonna figure it out?

444
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:21,476
You and me. We're never gonna happen.

445
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:23,874
You love me, Toby.

446
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:27,012
Fuck my ass.

447
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:44,398
Sister Pete! I'm gonna see you today, right?

448
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,698
3:00. You visiting one of your ex-wives?

449
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:50,605
- Yeah.
- Which one? Kitty or Angelique?

450
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:53,701
Bonnie. Wife number two and number four.
She's the best.

451
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,473
There she is, there she is.

452
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:01,881
- A redhead.
- No, the other one.

453
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:09,391
- Chris, she's...
- Huge.

454
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:15,124
Did she gain some weight after the divorce?

455
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,862
No, she was that way when I married her.
Both times.

456
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:21,229
Bye.

457
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,513
You and Schillinger were together
at Lardner when you were how old?

458
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:36,610
17.

459
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:40,013
He saved your life?

460
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:46,427
- Did you have sex together?
- Yeah.

461
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,592
Did he force himself on you?

462
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:54,168
Vern likes the power part of sex,
so I let him think he did.

463
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:59,106
- Do you enjoy sex with men?
- I enjoy sex. Don't you?

464
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:03,575
You told me you were married
before you became a nun.

465
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:05,615
Did you and your husband have great sex?

466
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:09,175
I can tell you did. I bet you were wild.

467
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,882
Lint.

468
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,624
Do you miss it? Sex?

469
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,863
- I miss my husband.
- Sure.

470
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:30,167
You ever have sex with anyone
other than him?

471
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,435
Chris.

472
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:34,242
You know, every time
we have a session together...

473
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,370
and we get to a topic you want to avoid...

474
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:40,713
you somehow manage
to turn the discussion around to me.

475
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:46,788
You noticed?

476
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:51,925
I just want to get to the heart...

477
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:55,397
of why you did what you did to Beecher.

478
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:02,937
You saw my ex, Bonnie?

479
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:08,469
When I met her,
she was all alone, very unhappy.

480
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:15,482
So I knew it would be easy
to get her to fall in love with me.

481
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:20,046
But what I didn't know...

482
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:24,216
was after I broke her heart...

483
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:28,031
would she still love me?

484
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:33,827
See, I'm a piece of shit.

485
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:40,108
I am worthless.

486
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:44,337
As bad as they come.

487
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:51,553
And to have someone keep loving me,
no matter how bad...

488
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,450
You happy now?

489
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:02,190
You got me to open up
and spill my guts all over your table.

490
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,338
Breakthrough.

491
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:15,044
So you went along with Beecher
not in the name of the Aryan brotherhood...

492
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,674
but to see if he would love you,
no matter what.

493
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:25,316
At first, I wanted unconditional surrender.

494
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,321
Then I wanted unconditional love.

495
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,524
But Beecher don't love me.

496
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,427
And that's killing you inside.

497
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:49,168
Yeah.

498
00:48:03,093 --> 00:48:05,527
"And forgive us our trespasses...

499
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:09,022
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

500
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,661
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

501
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:16,339
"For Thine is the kingdom..."

502
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:34,485
- This room is reserved.
- I know. For your Muslims.

503
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:36,383
Our daily study group.

504
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,126
Pull a chair.

505
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,658
I was raised Episcopalian.

506
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:48,902
Which means we thought about God
once a week for an hour.

507
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:53,476
But you, you think about him all the time.

508
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,677
- Yeah.
- Why?

509
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,448
I want to know him.

510
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:10,621
Me, too.

511
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:15,488
I want to know him.

512
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,096
I want to know God.

513
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,602
I want him to know me.

514
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:24,500
To know I'm here.

515
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,678
I'm still in this place.

516
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:32,443
He knows.

517
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:36,015
When I came to Oz...

518
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:39,722
I read the Bible from Genesis to Apocalypse.

519
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:45,759
Great book, the Bible.

520
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:52,563
May I borrow this? The Qur'an?

521
00:49:58,275 --> 00:49:59,606
Of course.

522
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,381
Beecher...

523
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,120
would you like to stay?

524
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:16,615
- Listen to our discussion?
- Yes.

525
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:22,831
Have a seat.

526
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,438
Come on in, my brothers.

527
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,537
What are you doing, allowing a non-believer
into our study group?

528
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:35,634
A non-believer?

529
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:38,246
You mean "white man."

530
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,477
He doesn't belong.

531
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:45,652
Beecher is a lost soul
searching for the truth.

532
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,915
He has every right to be there
to receive instruction.

533
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:50,016
No!

534
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:52,619
No?

535
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:57,030
Ever since I came to Oz,
I've listened to you rationalize your actions.

536
00:50:59,036 --> 00:51:01,436
You are no longer fit to lead us.

537
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:05,434
We need an imam who's above reproach.

538
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:09,203
And who's that, Khan? You?

539
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:10,939
Yes.

540
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:14,844
Never.

541
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:43,146
Nasim, come.

542
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:07,771
Oh, poor Said!

543
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:22,347
So it's true, what I heard?

544
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:24,620
Yes.

545
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,129
I still want you to teach me about God.

546
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:49,335
I'm not sure that I can.

547
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:00,920
Said's out.

548
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:04,586
Beecher came to my office, asked me
if he could move Said into his pod.

549
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:07,159
- And you said?
- Sure.

550
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:13,861
We need to set up a meeting
with whoever took Said's place.

551
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:15,495
- What's his name?
- Hamid Khan.

552
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:53,040
<i>Prisoner number 99K515, Hamid Khan.</i>

553
00:53:53,377 --> 00:53:56,608
<i>Convicted March 6, '99. Aggravated assault.</i>

554
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,043
<i>Sentence: 10 years. Up for parole in 5.</i>

555
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:47,957
Moving in with the white folk, Kareem?

556
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,634
Hey, lovebirds...

557
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:12,686
My all-time favorite punishment?
It's called "riding the stag."

558
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:16,087
The wittiest person in town
would be put on a chair...

559
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,650
carried around the streets
by his fellow townspeople...

560
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:21,664
while he banged on a bucket,
and yelled out dirty limericks...

561
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:23,666
condemning the accused.

562
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,663
Being made fun of...

563
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:30,139
being humiliated in front of everyone else
in your community...

564
00:55:30,273 --> 00:55:33,140
that may be the cruelest punishment of all.
